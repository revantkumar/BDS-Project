I am an electronic student from China, and I strongly support the proposal of OPT extension.

The opposite opinion came mainly from WATW, which argued that it is U.S. governments duty to protect native residents from losing their job. Also, they showed a subliminal consciousness that people who received education based on U.S. pedagogy system are more intelligent than others. Although these two statements may seem reasonable at the first glance, they are actually ill-conceived. Firstly, although U.S. government do have its duty to restrain unemployment rate from declination, it also needs to handle the problem of economy recession, which is more severe. By extend OPT from 17 months to 24 months, U.S. will be very likely to witness a flow-in of high-technical stuffs, which makes companies easier to select proper candidates for its working positions. Furthermore, no evident shows that native U.S. students are cleverer than students from other countries, especially students from China, which takes a disproportional large part of foreign students. This can be easily seen from a lot of aspects, including test scores from GRE quantitative reasoning section and SAT. In addition, based on the competition stress inside China, Chinese students usually are more assiduous than students from U.S.
