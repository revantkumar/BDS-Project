This regulation should be supported without hesitation! 

Come on! The most valuable things in current world is high tech human resource. STEM students IS INDEED this kind of people. US invites so many STEM students to US to get higher-education degree for free. US actually is doing an investment because most of benefits can only be harvested in the next few years after graduation. Then after graduation, US said you immediately get out of here and contribute whatever you learn to other countries. How stupid it is!

Diversity and open-mind was why US get successful in the past. Please keep it that way.
