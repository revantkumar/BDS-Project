Rui Wu Personally, I support this new rule. I think the proposed new ruling could benefit America from the following aspects.
First of all, it is the multi-subculture interaction that promotes America to be the most powerful country in the world. Under this new rule, more people will come to America, work for America and contribute to America. On the other hand, if similar beneficial rules are rejected, it would be difficult for foreigners to insist on their dream of America, which is also of great good for America.
Second, the economic of America would also benefit from the new rules. America is a big country. And the America economic needs enough purchasing power to maintain its vast economic aggregate. So we need more people who come for America. The new rule will bring more people to come to America and stimulate the development and revive of America economic.
Last but not least, the new rule would not hurt the America as well. Competition in America will promote native Americans to increase their competition all around the world. To sustain the advance of America, Americans needs to be high competitive of the whole world.
