This change is not in the interest of the citizens of this country. The current period is plenty to "train" a graduate of a STEM program to go back to the native country prepared for work. Our own STEM graduates deserve more help in getting and keeping jobs in our country. These tech companies already are rolling in profits from hiring H-1B workers at low wages and indentured servant conditions. Why give them the chance to do this further with the OPT program? All of us out here are sick and tired of our own government working against the children we have scrimped and saved to educate. Please think of the (hopefully) unintended consequences and don't go through with this. By the way, I don't understand why the government of the United States is taking comments on a regulation from foreigners. Aren't you supposed to be working for the people of the USA?
