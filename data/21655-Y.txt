Us now experiencing an really serious situation in IT industry, most employees are from the international students, if they didn't, they can not hire enough people to continue the tie business, I'm a international student and I don't think I took any chance from a citizen, because most time, a company would much preferred to hire a citizen than a foreigner, but the situation is they can't find so many skied citizen, and they need more people in their company for their business, and their business actually benefit every Americans to live better. So I strongly support this propose and wish the government could increase the quote for H1B too. 
Thanks,
