Junhua Gu 1. Opt stem extension does not affect American's chance to get a stem related job. The stem related jobs are those that American not good at, or not willing to taking part in. During the time I pursuing master degree in University of Michange--Ann Arbor. The computer science and electrical engineering program only have less than 20 American students among 400 students. Considering American pay less for tuition, and can get interviews and jobs in career fair much easily than international students. American student can get a stem job very easily if then want to study the stem related program in University. 

2. The stem extension will let more elite and excellent people go to American and help improve this country.

3. The whole study / work environment is much worse for international student, and stop the opt extension will make this worse. I was heard about American's spirit is freedom and equality. I am very disappointment about current situation.
