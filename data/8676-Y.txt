I believe OPT-extension if NECESSARY for our country.

The request to evict non-citizens in order to increase jobs is simply RIDICULOUS.

Right on the contrary of many anti-OPT-extension opinions the OPT extension makesthe US citizens more competitive than those OPT holders. BecauseOPT holders' jobs have to be directly related to their degree on which they're been trained for years to be excellentand ifa company would like to hire an OPT holder, his wage by law CANNOT be lower than the wage of citizens.

What is more, letting them stay will INCREASE not decrease jobs.My observation is that the main obstacle of a faster salary rise in this industry is outsourcing, not international students. Programmers who are educated outside America and mostly work outside America earn surprisingly low wages: some earn less than $10,000 per year and they can do the same thing (although usually in lower quality) American programmers do! They are the ones who steal our jobs and bring down our salary.
If they cannot get the extension, companies will ship the jobs to India, China and many other countries with lower pay if they cannot hire enough high quality workers in the US, or if the cost of hiring a US worker is too high. On top of this, international students create more jobs by opening companies.

Just remember, every citizen or their ancester once was an immigrant.The dominating status of the U.S. in the world in science and technology nowadays is largely owing to the contribution made by millions of scientific and technological talents coming from all over the world. The science and technology is the key to the further advancement of the U.S economy which benefits everyone of Americans. So in order for the future economy, we should allow those students holding F-1 visa stay longer.
