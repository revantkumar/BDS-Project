I support the proposal!

Who are Americans? Aren't we coming from different countries or our ancestors? Now we are against these well educated international students?

People are getting more and more stupid. We need these talents to serve for our society especially for Engineering and Science. 

We have many smart and hard working people. However, I have to say we need to learn a lot from others and there are definitely more people who are more excellent than us. I think it's good for society development. Only by competed with others , people will have motivation to improve themselves and make progress.

If we just hire citizens even though there are better candidates, our companies will be shut down some day in the future. It's too silly to do so. More talents, more opportunities. Because they are creating values, profits, funding to their employers. 

I support EHS AND I believe this is a good proposal which will benefit America. Please regardless of those who are just thinking of their own interest instead of the whole country. 

Even though there are not these foreigners, nuts are still nuts and they still can not find a job because they don't think about their own shortcomings.
