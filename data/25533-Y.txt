I STRONGLY DISAGREE!
IT IS EVEN NOT FAIR FOR ALL THE SKILLED US CITIZEN.

Are we still US CITIZEN???

Citizenship in this nation is becoming worth less and less, to the point that being a citizen is worth nothing at all. Why be a "citizen" when non-citizens ARE TREATED BETTER??? Disgusting!

Some companies who hires OPTs because they just want their Financial Statements LOOKS BETTER, and then to cheat the investors, but what about the tax revenue for the country and for the US citizens? The economic crisis caused by them, why we want this happen again???

STRONGLY DISAGREE!
