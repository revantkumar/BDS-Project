OPT extension is given to students who are seeking higher education, especially those with STEM degrees, opportunities to gain training experiences and further seek employment in America. The large amount of smart people with higher degrees is the key for America to stay advance in the world in different areas. We have provided lots of resources to educate these students and help them gain knowledge to excel in different areas. We need these people to innovate and contribute in US rather than pushing them back to their birth countries to compete with us. Without the pipeline of intelligent people, America will one day become Europe, and Asia will lead the future.
