The opt extension does not only benefit the international students but also the US citizens. During the opt, the international students contributed tremendously to the high tech field and also pay taxes. I don't understand why someone would panic that the international would steal jobs from them, the jobs the international take falls into the fields that have high demand and qualified citizens are not enough to fill up!And of course citizens are preferred in ANY positions if qualified. So the opt extension does no harm to citizens, but benefit both internals and citizens.
