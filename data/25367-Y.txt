I strongly support this new action. Hiring high-quality international employee will make huge contribution to the US tech company and to the US economy. High quality employees will make companies being competitive and expand new market to create more job position. In the STEM field, tech companies need qualified international employee is not because of lower pay for them, it is because they cannot find enough qualified US employee to fill the position. For example, in the engineering college in my university, more than 70% graduate students are international students and only 5% undergraduate students are international students. Rejecting the international students also does not mean tech company will give the job offer to those under qualified candidates. The companies may cut those vacant job positions in the US and try to put them in the overseas market. Even if they hire the under qualified candidates, the companies may lose competitiveness and lead to mass layoff in the near future.
