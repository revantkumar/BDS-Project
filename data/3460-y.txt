Grace Ouyang (2nd Comment) For those who oppose the OPT extension , most of their arguments are groundless and lack of evidence. And I will comment on two of them that are mentioned most frequently. 

Their claim that international students increase the burden of SSN and medicare actually reflects their little knowledge in how much STEM students have been contributed to the US economy. Many international STEM students have to pay SSN and medicare during their OPT if they have been in US for more than five years. That means, students with B.S/or PHD degree start to contribute to the retiring system and tax system soon after they find the job. Increasing the OPT time actually enables them to contribute more to the US economy. 

Their second claim is that STEM students are the root cause for some Americans losing their job. If carefully screening the jobs post on the big job hiring websites such as indeed, monster etc, one can quickly realize that more than 70% STEM jobs refuse to hire the international students due to the regulation barriers. Not every company is willing to go through complicated regulation to get paper work done and it is also difficult to be qualified for an e-verified company in order to hire students with OPT F1 visa. 

The jobs that are willing to consider the international students are usually ones that is either having a hard time to find a qualified US worker or being less appealing to US workers. If eliminating the OPT regulation, the business of these companies will be jeopardized and they will gradually lose their competence in the market. Eventually , the companies shut down and the US workers who happily work for these companies will lose their jobs too.
