I think it is very important for the industry such as IT technology, without this, a lot of intelligence can not stay and make efforts to the American society because of H1B issue. On the other hand, a lot of international Ph.D. degree graduates can not stay long, while US government has paid long time up to 7 years and money on these people, without the extension of OPT, they will also leave, in this sense, it is destroying American society advantages of keeping technology ahead of the rest of world. These people are the high intelligence source of GOOGLE, APPLE,MICROSOFT companies and so on. 
Moreover, if these people leave easily, the education attraction for the rest world will also be weaken, consider about how many profits the education make for the US country. We hope the government seriously address to this problem.Thank you.
