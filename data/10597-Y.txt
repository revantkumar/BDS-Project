I strongly support the new STEM extension, I have gone through the comments and found many negative comments about domestic workers loosing their job. But even with STEM extension, domestic students are favored than employers, they have more opportunities in finding a full time and part time position. Most of the employers don't support H1b visa. So I don't think having the STEM extension will lower the opportunities for quality domestic students to find jobs. But for the low quality students either domestic or international employer won't hire them anyway.
