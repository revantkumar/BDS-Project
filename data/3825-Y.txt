To Whom it may concern,

I like to start by sharing my support for this step forward in international students policy, I strongly believe this is a win- win situation fro all parties involved.

I am a international Student from Bolivia, I am currently doing my OPT after finishing a degree in Civil Engineering. My employment is bringing a lot of great experiences not only for me but also my my employer and our clients. My employment allowed my company to pursue jobs in South america, currently we have on going projects in Colombia, Chile and Bolivia for first time in the company history. This international exposure is opening tremendous opportunities for all parties involved. I am glad to be able to share my culture and experience in south america, serving as a bridge to bring new opportunities and knowledge to people in south america and also to my employer. among our trips to south america we are giving presentations in local universities and donating our time in some non-profit activities. 

We are also starting a new company with my current boss where I am going to be a partner of, in which we will be offering services to south america from the company for which I work for and other companies in our network.

Thanks for this opportunity,
