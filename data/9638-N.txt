The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.
I have personally suffered the effects of foreign workers being hired rather than hiring skilled American workers. I am stuck in a part time job that doesn't pay me enough to effectively supplement my Social Security. To tell the truth, I am just barely getting by. Millions of American workers are in the same boat. We want to work!
Giving American jobs away to foreigners is not the American way. You have to take care care of American citizens FIRST!
