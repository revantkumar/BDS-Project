It is very important to have a longer opt period for our STEM students. Actually, most of our young people are the only child in China and we will back to China to take care of our parents after graduated . We come to US to study knowledge and we have a dream of freedom. However, the knowledge from book is not enough at all. We need to practice it, so we can have a better job in China. It is hard for a foreigner to get a good job in U.S., The fact is, we work hard to increase the economics of America, and at the same time we gain the experience of the job. It is a win win situation, not only for our F1 students, but also for the Americans. If a company cannot get a suitable person in a much lower cost, it will move to another country. That means a lot of citizen will loss their job.
