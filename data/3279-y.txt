Erik Wang I strongly support this OPT extension proposal and want to point out that: Companies hire foreigners is because there's no appropriate American candidate to take the job. Based on companies and whole economy, the OPT extension would benefit in many aspects. If the opt extension was cancelled, it would provide much burden for companies.
