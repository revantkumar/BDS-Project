I support this proposal.

I am an international student studying in Japan right now majoring in EE and I've been planning to further my studies in the U.S. the next year. However, if STEM is cancelled, I don't even need to come to the U.S. and pay private school tuition knowing that I won't have enough opportunity to look for jobs or practice what I learned.

I will probably choose Canada or Australia instead since they have much more generous policies for talented immigrant tech professionals even compared to the STEM. I guess U.S. will start losing brain power and income from immigrant students who normally pay more expensive tuition compared to American students. This is a lose situation for the U.S. Instead with the approval of this proposal, to U.S. income and growth and to job seeks from overseas and local it'll be a win-win situation.
