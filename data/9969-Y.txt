As I see it, the problem here is discrimination. Not a bad thing by itself, we use it to make many choices in day to day living. When it comes to people is when it gets bad. Employers may choose hires by many criteria, costs, qualifications, etc. That's their right to do so. They understand the exchange of compensation for effort. The best factor is merit. If merit is discarded, and other factors are used such as race and gender or nationality, there is the risk of reverse discrimination. That too should be avoided. I understand that in some cases, the government will provide additional funding to hire some preferred group. A travesty by any name. The government should not be promoting any specific group. Social issues should not be mixed with business in any circumstances. Business should be allowed to conduct itself in any manner that benefits itself. While that might sound bad, it isn't. A successful business can grow and hire many more people or fail if it's decisions are poor. The government should have no say in that. Nor should it bribe a business to conform to a social ideology. Merit alone should be the prime factor in hiring. Maybe not the only, but the prime. I could go on about over-regulation and such but I'll rest my case for success and expansion here.
