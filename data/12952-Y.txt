I really support the new 24 months STEM OPT extension. It's very important for US technology industry. Now tech companies highly rely on foreign student graduates to work, especially as engineers, which are not enough in US. For example, my current company is a small startup with only 10 people. We are working on a new web security product with complex machine learning and database techniques, but it's quite difficult to find enough US citizen with qualified background to do the engineering work. And even if we found these kind of people, they are not affordable for a new startup company, so there' no choice but to hire foreign students to do the work. No except 2 co-founders, all 2 full-time engineering guys are using OPT to work. If these two people have to leave US because of STEM OPT extension fails to pass, it will be a disaster for the company. Then we will not be able to deliver and maintain the product. And since we are growing, we will hire more people. We will going to hire US citizen designers, marketing people, and engineers, but for sure we need foreign students to fill engineering positions. So please agree the STEM OPT extension, we will create more job opportunities for US.
