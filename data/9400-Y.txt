I have to say as a F-1 international student currently I strongly support this proposal for additional 24-month extension of OPT.

First of all, this new policy could provide a longer working period legally for the students who learned knowledge and obtained high-level educational degree from U.S. universities to stay in the country without any other concern about their immigration status and let them keep making contributions to the country. I think that is what government want to see, otherwise the talented people the government spent money on will work for the other countries. 

Freedom and diversity are very important since the first day of establishment of united states. Everybody has the equal chance and right to do what they are thinking right way, of course, under the rules. If anyone do not support this proposal, that is behaviors opposing the spirit of US and US constitution. 

Last but at least, some one may doubt about that the proposal will let moire immigrants stay in america and compete with the local citizen. Please do not forget the history, decades ago, so many new comers from all over the world started new life in america with american dream. Consequently, they do have the better life and fulfilled their dream to make this land a wonderful world. Although competition exist, it could not impede our life, economy, science and even politics but improve every field mentioned above. More importantly, the people the proposal support for are those who almost all have Ph.D. degree from all areas of STEM, which are so beneficial to US citizen and US. Average persons actually do not necessarily worry about the competition, simply because they are not the competitors at all.
