Shuo Liu The US is a country build up by people like this.

Now some people is trying to stop the nation from being a advantageous country for brilliant young minds. It is ridiculous to abandon what has made the nation No.1 on the planet.

For sure US will not be as attractive a place to study and work for non-native people if this one does not pass. It is short sighted to drive the young people away.
