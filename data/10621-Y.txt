1. The foreign students study very hard, especially the international people with STEM major, they helped a lot in the industry, lots of them became the leading character in the industry. they contributed tramendous growth to the USA economy

2. Diversity is veryimportant for the U.S

3.The request to place the right of citizens over non-citizens is simply RIDICULOUS. Just remember, every citizen or their ancester once was an immigrant.
