Katie Tan We should definitely have the STEM extension to 24 months. Based on the data from 2013-2014, 886,052 international students who study in US has made a contribution of 268000000000 dollars. These international students gave strong support to 3400000 US citizen's jobs. According to the recent data, the contribution from international student to US has been growing dramatically. Also, as we all know, we are experiencing a great burden in US pension recently with the retirement of babyboomers. This problem is hard for Americans to solve especially when the birth rate is dropping. The situation will be worse in the future. With the tax and social security contributed from international students, the problem can be released to some extent. 
US is famous for our education. There are more and more international students coming to US to pursuit higher education. However, if we cancel the OPT extension, fewer internationals students will choose US as their next destination. We will lose profit from our education.
