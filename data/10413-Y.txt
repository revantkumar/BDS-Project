I strongly support OPT extension programs. I'm an international student who have graduated with a PhD in mechanical engineering and is currently working on a long technical project. 

One of the biggest reasons I came to United States for graduate school is the OPT and its extension program. Otherwise, I might have chosen Canada or Singapore. If this program is being rejected, this would inevitably reduce the appeal of American university education to international students. In consequence, it will harm all the American universities and research institutions. 

Also, this program has a strong positive effect on United States economy. The students who get stay are those Americans need most: STEM grads. These students becomes a crucial work force in American high tech industry. 

In the end, I want to say that United States is a country of immigrants. It is a pity that some people forget about the fact that his/her ancestors once were immigrants as well. If we allow this kind of conservative mentality to prevail and believe we are born entitled of everything without competition and hard work, the glory and vibe of this country has now will eventually fade away.
