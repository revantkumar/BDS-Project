I strongly agree with this rule for the following reasons:
1. The OPT extension will give the student more chance to contribute himself and practice their skills after graduation. There are so many talented international student which will bring great benefit to the U.S not only on economy but also on education.
2. US is a big country with different cultures, everybody here should have the equal chance to contribute to the world, to make the world more beautiful.
3. The cultural diversity and the advanced education and rapidly developed economy will keep the country to the world the best.
