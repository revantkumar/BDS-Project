As a STEM graduate student studying in the U.S., the extension of OPT is extremely important and beneficial to every one of the F1 students studying and working in this country like me. We are all striving for a better life here. I think hard work should at least deserve a better opportunity and this extension of OPT is exactly a great one for us F1 students. Therefore I truly hope this regulation will pass without difficulty and I will appreciate this great opportunity and use this chance to contribute myself to this country.
