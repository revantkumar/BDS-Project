This is a very good initiatives. The number of student coming to USA is increasing day by day. So the chance of getting H1B for students becoming more difficult. At least after this rule students will get 3 chances for their H1b lottery. Also the amount of money a student is spending to get a degree from USA, after this extension at least they have more time now to get back some of it. From a US company prospective it is also good. Now any company can hire a OPT student for longer period, they do not have to worry for at least 3 years.
