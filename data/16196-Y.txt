I strongly SUPPORT this extension of OPT period for STEM subjects students. I believe this is totally good for the benefit of the US and US people. 
Thousands of foreign students came to the US and received best training and education under the best universities in America, the extension allows them more time and space to contribute more to the US economy. 
Besides, most of the STEM students filled up the employment opportunity which US citizens may not want to do or not suitable for. International students who come to the US may make their decision of choosing schools and countries based on this. If this extension was cancelled, lots of excellent students could be attracted to somewhere else around the world.
Also I believe the extension would not affect the employment of US citizens because the amount of STEM students in comparison of the whole employment opportunities in the job market is too small to count for any significant influence.
In brief, I totally SUPPORT the extension.
