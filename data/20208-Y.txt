Big support for OPT EXTENSION!!! 

I'm a graduate student. My major is Computer Science. In my department, only 20% of students are Americans. All other 80% of students are F-1 students. Without OPT extension, all these 80% students have to leave the United States and make contributions to companies in their own countries. It would be much harder for companies to find ideal candidates. Without these hardworking employees, companies have to slow down their ongoing projects or even stop making profits. This would be a great loss to the United States. Therefore, I strongly support for improving and expanding Training Opportunities for F1 Nonimmigrant Students!
