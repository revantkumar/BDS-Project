I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:

1. The governmentshould let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S. That is the best way for US to get return from its generous share.

2. Compared with illegal migrants, skilled and highly educated stem students contribute much more to U.S. There is no reason to solve the problem of illegal migrants who may lead to chaos but ignore the international students who definitely lead to developement of this country.

3. Positive competition will finnaly result in a healthy and continually developing talent market. Cutting down the number of excellent stem worker never help to promote jobs home but spoil those people whithout pressure, and limit thier improvment.
