Carlos Reyna I do support this new rule and making OPT extension happen. I had a couple of direct reports from foreign countries and used to hold OPT. They were all hard working and extremely talented. They played key role in the projects I managed and led. I think these diversity power will lead to better quality and culture in corporations. And some other comments mentioned that foreign workers will form competition with US citizens in the job opportunity. I have admit that competition does exist, but it is this healthy competition that made our country holding the leading position if advanced science and technology. And it is this healthy competition that made our silicon valley to be the capital of high tech industry of the whole world and wall street be the central of financial activities of the planet. So let's embrace the top talents from all over the world who were educated by our own universities, and give them a chance to help keep our states the land of freedom and the best places among all the countries.
