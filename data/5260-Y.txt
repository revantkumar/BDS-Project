The opt extension for STEM student not only helps international students gain more work exerpence in the US but also benefits the US education system and the US's economic. And mostly importantly, as a leading nation in the world, USA should help international students bring home the knowledge and skills they learn and practice in the US to contribute to the development of their home countries and making the world a bit better. 

With the extension, STEM students can practically apply what they learn in class to the real working environment, by which they can strengthen their skills and knowledges and bring home the advanced and pioneering technologies. As science major international student, one of the reasons why I chose to come to the states to study is because of the OPT extension for STEM major. I could have gone to UK or Australia but they don't provide as good practical training policy for international students. And I know the majortituies of my friends who came to the states are because of that. The OPT extension policy certainly puts USA the first choice of contry to study to many international students. More international students means the school have more funding to develop their education system, to help more domestic students who are in need of financial aid, to be able to fund more researches , all of which will help USA continue to be the best place for education and researches. More international students and longer they stay in the US means they spend more money to help with the growth of local economic. Last but not least, as the leader in the world, USA should take the respoisbility to teach and help students front eh globe to bring home better knowledge and skills, in collaboration, USA can leads the world to a brighter future. Thank you.
