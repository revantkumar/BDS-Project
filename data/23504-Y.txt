Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Non-immigrant Students with STEM degrees is very important, which can affect thousands of (or even more) international students who are temporarily employed in the U.S. Among all the institutions, international students play incomparable roles (such as banking, technology). If the policy is revoked, many institutions will lose so many international employees that they cannot fill those positions effectively. I definitely support the extension of OPT with STEM degrees.
