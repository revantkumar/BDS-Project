This proposal will let foreign engineering students work in US companies after they graduate, which will greatly benefit US economy. Besides, the working positions they'll be in, like computer science and software engineer, are not conflict with the positions that most US citizen are interested in, so I believe this proposal will benefit US economy and US working market, and will also let hi-tech companies in US recruit more talented foreign nation students, which will also be beneficial to these companies.
