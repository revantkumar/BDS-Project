Xue Zhang I strongly support this rule for these reasons:
1) OPT and OPT extensions for STEM students make thousands of American universities much more attractive than other universities in the world. I chose to come to the US for my graduate study instead of going to UK due to the OPT and OPT extension policy. Because, in this way, I could gain more international internship or working experience before I go back to China, which makes me more competitive in China's job market. To some extent, OPT and OPT extensions policy are the major reason for Chinese students to come to the United States for study. Without these policies, we would prefer universities in these countries than in the US:
1. UK - 1)it is easier for us to apply for more famous universities in the UK than in the US; 2) UK's bachelor and master programs are shorter than the US programs, thus the tuition and living expense is cheaper for us to study there
2. Canada - famous and world first-class universities with much much cheaper tuition and much and much friendly policies to international students!!! 
3. Australia & New Zealand - Cheaper Tuition with same high-quality education, more friendly policies toward international students
2) Thus, if the OPT and OPT extension policy disappear or if the United States release any negative message about the current OPT policies, millions of Chinese students will not come to the US for study, thus thousands of universities will lose a huge sum of tuition coming from us. Besides, the United States will lose lots of money from these huge group of consumers. 
3) My landlord once said, without these international students coming here for study each year, she would be able to rent her house such easily. Because we are in a small city in the US with low population mobility.
