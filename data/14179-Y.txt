To be honest, as a sociology student, who is not a stem student, I am fully supporting this policy. For long term, extending OPT will improve the economy of U.S. Those big companies can have more time to test whether those students are qualified or not. It is a good way to filter employees, left those talented people only. Someone may argue that it deprives local labor. On the contrary, only those lower-educated or lower-paid people will think so. For those who are in the middle class, they don't even get bothered by foreign labors, no matter the OPT is one month or ten years.
