I am a phd candidate having been in America for almost four years. My concerns is that we need time to think about where and what to do in the future. We need more time to think about it and that is how the opt works for us. It is not that good to put too much pressure on us. And the industry gets whole lot of students within opt. If the time for opt decreases, that will be bad for the industry as well. Please think it over before make a decision. We are the generation the hope of the world. People have the chance to decide by themselves. Do not push too hard. Thanks
