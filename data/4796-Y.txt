I strongly support this proposed rule and it's obviously wrong for those who thought that STEM international students are cheap labor!
Take Computer Science (CS) for example, let's have a short look on the tuition of the best ten university or college in CS field. (From US News university ranking)
1.Massachusetts Institute of Technology $43,210 per year (full-time) 
2.Stanford University $45,480 per year (full-time) 
3. University of California Berkeley $11,220 per year (in-state, full-time); 
$26,322per year (out-of-state, full-time) 
4.Carnegie Mellon University $40,000 per year (full-time) 
5.University of IllinoisUrbana- Champaign $16,754 per year (in-state, full-time); 
$30,246per year (out-of-state, full-time) 
6.University of MichiganAnn Arbor $22,322 per year (in-state, full-time); 
$41,998per year (out-of-state, full-time) 
7.Georgia Institute of Technology $11,324 per year (in-state, full-time); 
$27,330per year (out-of-state, full-time) 
8.Cornell University $29,530 per year (full-time) 
9.Purdue UniversityWest Lafayette $10,332 per year (in-state, full-time);
$29,134per year (out-of-state, full-time) 
10.University of TexasAustin (Cockrell) $9,564 per year (in-state, full-time);
$17,506 per year (out-of-state, full-time) 
The average tuition of CS master degree is about at least 20,000 dollars for international students. As is known to all that Chinese and Indians are the major in CS field and let's convert the tuition to RMB and INR. The tuition is about 130,000 RMB and 1300,000 INR which is huge for Chinese and India families.
Thus, the tuition is no doubt large burdens for them. There is no way for them to play with the minimum wage level! Everyone consider costs and gains! Let's say Albany, NY, NY state has a minimum wage limit of $9.00, but the minimum hourly pay standard for H1b holder is $24.16! Are you kidding me by arguing that they take the position of cheap labor?
OK, let's cool down. STEM are vital for social development. Why America is Ameri
