I strongly support this act, I believe it will have great benefit to USA.

First, when I study in New Jersey Institute of Technology for a master two years' programming, I found that there is only a few american people under STEM major, a lot of STEM major are international student especially Computer Science, so many company want to high education level employee they have no choice but to hire STEM international student. But if don't have the extension act, STEM major student only have one year permit working in USA, the company only can have their ideal employee one year they should hire new people every single year, it's really bad for a company's growth. 

Second, STEM students are not cheap laber, now many STEM international students are working for big company, like FLAG company in CA or NYC, they will have great contribution to push forward the economic growth. 

Finally, there is no published report said STEM students costs Social Security and Medicare a lot of funds, in opposite, they will pay a lot for the tuition.

So I strongly support this act.
