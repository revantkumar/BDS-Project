I do support the opt-extension. Foreign tech workers contributed tramendous growth to the United States in many aspects, especially in economy over these years. If the United States loses these parts of the growth, the whole country will be effected from daily life to national development. Without the these tech workers, the development will be postponed. It will effect not only the United States, but also the world. After all, the United States is the central of the world in tech. If the opt-extension will be denied. The economy of the country will be strongly effected, people will lose jobs, and social problems will arise. That will be the situation which nobody expects.
