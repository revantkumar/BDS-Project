I strongly support this rule. Population and high tech knowledge are essential for U.S. Economic developments. This rule will encourage talented high-tech students working in the US and contribute U.S. economy. A high rate of economic growth will also create job opportunities and consumption, which are also important for U.S. economy. Talented foreign workers in IT area will not cause the unemployment of Americans. On the contrary, the increased consumption will create more jobs for Americans.
