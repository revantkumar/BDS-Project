Hello:

My name is Bruce Glover and I am a 48 year old Black American from Boston Massachusetts. I urge you to cease these programs that favor foreign workers over American citizens. There is a lack of respect for the work ethic and intelligence of native born Americans, especially in high-tech companies. 

They would rather import foreigners than give low-income Americans,especially if they are Black a chance to do these jobs.Ending these visa programs would compel these companies to hire more Americans who are unemployed or underemployed.
