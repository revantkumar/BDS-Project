Dear officer:

I'm an EE graduate student in Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). 

Pursuing an degree in the United States requires several years of salary of our parents. We foreign students comes to United States with expectation and hope of better education and better life, nor only for some experience of studying abroad. We are not only studying, but also looking for internships before graduation. However, because of unfamiliar with US culture, restriction of citizenship, language issues and gap of transferring majors, etc, it's much harder for foreign students to find job opportunities in US. Even after graduation, we only have 17-month long OPT.

Now we have the chance to extend OPT to 24-month long, I'm excited we foreign students will have more chance to pursue our dream in the US. All foreign students would be thankful if we get the extension.

Regards,
Student from WPI.
