I finished my undergraduate study in Indiana. Currently I am pursuing a Master's degree in operations research in New York. I chose to attend US universities because I knew I could be offered practical training after graduation. As a STEM student, I expected to have a total of 29 months training in a field that was highly related to my course of study. I could obtain hands-on experience and this is the reason why I chose US academic institutions. So I support this proposed rule.
