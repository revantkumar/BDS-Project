I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.
2. Although having OPT, international students still have lots of disadvantages when finding a job than U.S. citizens. And even if competition exists, it is not a bad thing. It will help the nation to select the better workers and make U.S. talent market more competitive in the whole world, which will definitely contribute to the economy growth and stability.
