F-1 students with OPT are creating fake resume and showing fake experience and becoming competition to real experienced employees. They are hurting the U.S citizens by working on low wages and creating cheap labor.

So, when a U.S citizen who has 8-10 years of experience is getting $100K per year, the F-1 students with OPT are having no experience at all and showing fake experience and fake resume and creating competition for U.S citizens.

This rule is definitely hurting the U.S citizens jobs, F-1 OPT doesn't have any criteria for LCA from DOL.
