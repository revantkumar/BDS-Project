I really strongly support the proposal for two reasons:

Firstly, the proposal will enhance the diversity of America students and cultural, as we know, the international students play an significant role in America school culture. What's more, the increasing amount of top scientists and engineers come from the increasing number of International students, it really help American development!

Secondly, there are some companies need the international students, they match the positions that cannot be found enough qualified people!
