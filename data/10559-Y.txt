I definitely SUPPORT STEM OPT extension. 
Suddenly canceling the OPT extension is not reasonable. As a master student coming to US in 2014, I want to have some American work experience. If US doesn't give the opportunity, why not tell us earlier, before we applied the universities? China's and Indian's, including other developing countries' avenue is not high, so we spend lot of money studying here. If only listening some courses, without the work experience. what's the reason to come here? At least, we should be given 2-3 years to adjust our career plan and the policy should be published 2-3 years in advance. 

Influencing the local employment is not our purpose and this should be considered by the US government, when they give us Student visa. We should not be the sacrificers when policy is suddenly changed. If so, we can't believe US in the future. You have technology advantage, we learn from you. You don't have, we will not come even with your invitation, just as American do. 

With the carefully treatment from US, we international students will be grateful to the strong country and will like to cooperate with US friends in the future, when we return to our motherland. It will be benefit to both US and our countries. Please consider my words and be responsible to our international student whose intent is to learn knowledge and work experience here, not to stay and seize local people jobs.
