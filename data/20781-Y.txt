Definitely supporting this 24 month STEM extension proposal!

The international students in STEM programs are all top students from world wide. They are the fundamental power to drive United States's technology and economy. 

This is the best time to keep them here since countries like China are growing fast and more and more people prefers to stay in their home country for their career. The extension will attract more top students to come to U.S. and will definitely have a big positive impact on the economy. 

I believe in few years later, no one would suffer so much come all the way to U.S. if the economy and technology environment in their own country offers sufficient and probably even better opportunities. At that time U.S. will face the same situation in Europe nowadays.
