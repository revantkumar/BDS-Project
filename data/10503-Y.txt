Jeff Thomas I SUPPORT the proposal for the following reason:
1. America needs to maintain its academic competitiveness globally by encouraging talent international students to get involved in expanded post-graduate opportunities in the United States. And not just the academy, the contribution of F1 students to America is significant in economy. F1 students need to pay high tuition fee every semester which has its own contribution to the funding of a university, not even to mention research achievements they made to industry, which definitely boosted the economy growth in America. 
2. Many people argued that a number of Americans will loose their jobs because of this. Actually, there are policies stated in this proposal defensing the benefit of American people. One of them goes roughly like this: the employer will not terminate U.S workers as a result of providing the STEM OPT to the student. This will be effective to protect the wellbeing of U.S workers. And there are more of this, we really don't need to worry about this.
