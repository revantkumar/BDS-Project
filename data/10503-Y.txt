No! Do not give more than 12 month OPT period. This is abused by many to keep out the U.S. workforce from employment. If the foreign graduates can't find a job within 12 months, they are not qualified to stay here because they do not have necessary skills to get a job. Treat US citizens/residents and foreign students similarly. Do not give an added advantage to foreign students. This is unacceptable. If there is a need for workforce development, help the universities recruit more students by providing affordable tuition or free education. Extending OPT is not a sustainable solution. US has qualified students who needs financial support to get in to the education system. Introduce free education that is offered by the 3rd world countries.
