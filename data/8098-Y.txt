I fully support this proposal. 

Not only does it provide students to gain supplemental experience and experience, it gives them (and their employers) an opportunity to thoroughly assess their careers' future in the United States. This is a good step forward that will attract bright students and allow them to learn some while contributing even more to the industry!
