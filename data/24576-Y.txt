Although I am not a STEM major student in the United States, I agree to the new Regulation of improving and expanding training opportunities for STEM F-1 students. I saw some opponents claimed that the Regulation will provide unfairness to U.S. citizens in STEM fields in job hunting. I find their arguments totally ridiculous. 
All companies will put the talent as the priority when hiring employees. If you find it almost impossible to get yourself a job, it is because you are not qualified, but not because of the companies are in favor of F-1 nonimmigrant students. The logic behind this is so simple. How could a 'clever' STEM student couldn't figure out. 
The expansion on the OPT will introduce diversity into American technical industry and will be a positive influence to America.
