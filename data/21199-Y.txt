I am an internaltional student who just began to work in a technical company on my OPT. I strongly SUPPORT this regulation since this is a win-win strategy. It not only benefits the international students who have spent several years in the US to study, but also provides great potential help for America economy recovery. STEM students make significant contribution to US economy. Silicon valley needs to attribute part of its success to internaltion STEM students. Actually, more STEM students work hard in every industry, the more job opportunities will be created since this industry will become more prosperous.

Thinking that international students will deprive the job opportunies from Americans is such a narrow view. It never considers the flexibility of an industry. The truth is without enough talented people, the economy will go to unavoidable recession. At that time, the job market will shrink a lot. Even Americans cannot find a good job easily.
