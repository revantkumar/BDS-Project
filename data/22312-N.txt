We shouldn't be hiring foreign students to take jobs of American workers. We need these jobs for our own students. How stupid can this regulation be that allows even 24 months now. These students should go home after graduation and help their countries. As usual this administration circumvents congress and does what it wants, but we need jobs for Americans first. Whether you are Democrat or Republican, you shouldn't support any rule that hurts American jobs. We need jobs for our unemployed students.
