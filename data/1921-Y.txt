I strongly support this new rule to support STEM program. 
1. The new rule will provide U.S a lot of talented employee. This will help improve the technology and economy of U.S. With better economy, the domestic unemployment rate will get lower since there will be more demand on employment. 
2. The new rule will attract more international students to study in the U.S. Therefore the school will get more economic support from these students. Colleges will therefore get more money to support domestic students who cannot afford education. Also the extra economic support will help colleges fund their researches. 
3. U.S is a country that strives to give equal opportunities to every individual. I believe the new rule will help the country reach this ultimate goal.
