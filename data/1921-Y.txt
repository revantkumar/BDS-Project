Patricia Janssen I'm sick and tired of our government (taxpayer's money) ignoring the plight of the American Citizens! We need to put a Moratorium on Immigration immediately. It should have been done years ago! Now we also have Illegal Immigrants taking our jobs, SS, Medicaid/Medicare, Food 
Stamps, Housing, etc. away from the American Taxpaying Citizens! We cannot sustain these Leeches any longer! 

There are over 2 million unemployed residents of the United States with a bachelor's or higher STEM degree.

There are about 10 million Americans with STEM degrees not working in their specialties, many of whom would return to those fields with appropriate incentives.

Big Tech lobbyists have spent over $1 billion seeking immigration increases, but Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard 
are laying off tens of thousands of employees. This is just plain Crazy!

Protect America NOW!
