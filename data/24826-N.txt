Can someone help me understand how this helps real working american citizens? How does it not hurt at least some of those real american citizens seeking these types of jobs?
I could care less about how some employer thinks it helps them get cheap, educated labor. We have a crisis in that our educated graduates are already over their heads in dept and under paid due to cheap labor competition. This is a very questionable undertaking via sneaky backdoor policies. 
This needs to be stopped immediately. Let's make it a referendum item and let american citizens vote on it. What do you think they'd say? At least do a poll for guidance... geez.
