I don't agree with many comments about how this extension will cause foreign workers to take away jobs from American workers. This extension is effective only to international students who can actually find a job in the US. Many jobs are not open for international students as long as there are qualified domestic candidates. So those do find jobs in the US are normally taking positions that cannot be taken by American workers.Limiting them to work for only 12 months will not help increasing job opportunities for Americans, but will cause companies to lose assets.
