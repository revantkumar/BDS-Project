Its really a good and non-replaceable regulation that can attract more elites from all around the world to contribute toUS.
1. Those people won't affect US local employment since the majors are highly restricted.
2. Walking through all US universities that have top level engineering school, almost 70% of those people are foreign students and they beat all the competitors in their country to grab a chance to be well trained here. If we let them go after they finish their degree, it will be a huge lost to US industry.
3. STEM companies have a relatively high recruitment bat for the people they hire, thus guarantee the quality of foreign employee.
4. US is the country of freedom and is built by countless foreigners from the beginning of its history, and keep this feature is the only way we can continue make US the greatest country in the world.
