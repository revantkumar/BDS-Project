I am tired of this administration using my tax dollars to promote the welfare of foreigners, illegal invaders and non-citizens rather than the American citizen/worker. No one should get a work visa unless they can PROVE they have a skill that an American worker does not and that they can fill a position that an American worker cannot. Disney is a prime example. Firing American workers to replace them with cheaper foreign workers. This is perverse and should not be.
