I strongly support this proposal. The United States benefits from attracting individuals that are already skilled and educated to produce work temporarily for the nation. Large U.S. based companies also benefit from this influx, which strengthens the nation's overall power.

Seemingly this will affect employment for U.S citizens in STEM fields, but in the long run, their contributions to the technology side of U.S. industry will benefit U.S. citizens in that the overall services provided to them, as well as their job's positive impact on society per hour per person will become better due to faster improvement in technology. Also, new job opportunities will arise from improved technology. Examples are abundant in the STEM fields in industry -- once in a while we hear of new U.S. companies that started using new technologies or business models made possible by improved technologies. These benefits would come significantly slower without the influx of F-1 student interns (and immigrants).

In other words, they work less and produce more, get better things, or work in better ways with the contributions of these F-1 students' internship or immigration. And I believe U.S. citizens in the STEM field will also benefit from this in the same way -- they need better technology to produce better work.

This comes at a lower cost in terms of tax money invested, since these F-1 individuals are already educated elsewhere in the world before they became F-1 students.
