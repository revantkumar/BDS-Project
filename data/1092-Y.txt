zhiying jing I strongly support the 24-month OPT- STEM extension rule!

First of all, the two years extension for allowing F1 student to work US will not increase competition for US citizens. If there is a job which a pool of graduate students can be qualified, the company will put the local citizens into first consideration. Since the two-year is just Temporary working permission, no company wants to take risk of spending more time and cost to train employees. The job, which F1 student can take, must be a highly skillful position or there are some unique strength for F1 student which company does not want loses talent. The ultimate goal for each company is generate profit so when they have talent to help company to grow up, they have more open positions. Thus in this way, it also create more opportunity for local citizens to work. Eventually it will boost US economy.

Secondly, Although OPT students can exempt certain amount of tax, in the long term if they get H1B visa, they actually need to pay more taxes than local citizens. As F-1 students come to US, they have already contributed a great amount of money for their education and expenses in US. In this way, the 24-month OPT- STEM extension rule definitely does not have negative impact on US economy!

In addition, I think the 24-month OPT- STEM extension rule can play incentive role for all US workers to become more competitive and knowledgeable. Especially for Tech worker, if they want to secure a job or distinguish themselves, they need to improve themselves at first rather than complaining another international student take their jobs. If you have a unique and unparalleled skill, no company wants to let you go!

Overall, I think the 24-month OPT- STEM extension rule is reasonable and no negative impact. I strongly support the 24-month OPT- STEM extension rule!
