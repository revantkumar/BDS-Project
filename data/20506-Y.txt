United States is global economy and not giving a chance of an OPT extension to students will not be a fair chance for the students to implement what they learnt. Not giving an extension will not only effect the students but will also effect the companies as they will loose on some good talent. This will also effect the education sector as many students might not consider coming to the US as they wouldn't be able to get their return of investment here.
