I strongly support this rule for the following reasons: 1. It's American spirit to give everyone equal chance. And talented students who come to US to study deserves more time to practice their skills after graduation. 2. America was founded by immigrants from the beginning. 3. It's good for US economy to have talented foreign people work in IT area. 4. It's good for US education since longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in US. 5. Companies will have an easier time expanding or communicating globally since all of us are at least bi-lingual.
