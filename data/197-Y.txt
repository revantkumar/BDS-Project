Brenda Koehler I have an undergraduate degree in Business - Information Technology and a graduate degree Master of Science - Business - Information Technology and I have issues finding jobs. I have been laid off twice in the past decade. I have trained my replacements on at least three different occasions at two different financial firms. By giving the beginner jobs to H1-B visa holders, it makes it hard for new American degree holders to get the jobs they need to become management. We do not need more H1-B visa people in technology. India already has very large campuses set up on Indian soil that have taken enough American jobs.
