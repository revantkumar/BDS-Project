Tianqing Shao I understand some guys disdain Chinese and Indian guys because they think those guys take a lot of job position which should belong to themselves. In fact, that's a fundamental misunderstanding and logic fallacy in simple economics. Giving job positions to those talented people from China and India will only make the entire U.S society benefit more rather than sacrificing someone's own good. We Chinese engineers work hard to bring the best talent all the way from the other side of Pacific Ocean, and by the way, we are not staying here forever (most of us still will go back to China someday in the near future)so don't be panic that we will make most of Americans out of job forever! That' s not gonna happen okay? Look at the title! All we want is just more opportunity to train our skills from campus to workplace.
