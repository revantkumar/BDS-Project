I think it's a great initiative to extend the opt to 2 years for STEM programs. However, I think what would really be helpful both to the employers and employees would be to increase the h1b visa cap as well while maintaining an equal pay rate irrespective of their citizenship status which would restrain the employers from laying off existing employees americans or otherwise and America would get the best of the best to help build their economy even further.
