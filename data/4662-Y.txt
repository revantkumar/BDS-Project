I'm from China and studying PhD in Mechanical Engineering here. At the beginning I am pleased to be informed that the new OPT STEM program have 24 months extension. This is a good news to me since I am looking for jobs right now. However, if the new OPT extension rule fails to pass, I have no option but to go back to my home country. It's not that bad to me since I have a PhD, but the US will lose a PhD who has potential to make more contributions here. And there will be more PhDs you are going to lose.
