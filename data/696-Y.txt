Weiling Yu I highly support this policy that extends opt for another 24 months. This would allow international STEM students to have better career development than just a 12 month OPT, and have more opportunities to get an H1b visa. It benefits companies in this country too because they have more freedom hiring talents without the restrictions of nationality.
