The objectors' statements are unreasonable, they said that native American students love STEM but are denied by technical companies. They condemned that it is the foreign students' fault to grab the working opportunities that should belong to native Americans. but they are trying to confuse the conception of love and being good at. The number of native American student that satisfied the requirements of high-tech companies are far from enough (only about 23.55 percents of annual required employees in 2013). So should we just keep the working opportunities for those talent foreign students or let they return to their own countries and serve those foreign companies to seize the American market with American enterprises? I think the answer is quite clear.
