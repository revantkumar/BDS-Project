As a U.S citizen, I SUPPORT this proposal for at least two reasons:

1. Many firms in our country are equal opportunity companies for the seek of having the very best talents around the world make various contributions to our society. Not having this proposal approved will certainly cause enormous international talents lose. 

2. Many of the reviewers think this proposal will put American candidates in an unfair situation. THIS IS A LITTLE SELFISH AND UNCONVINCING. I strongly believe competition drives to excellence. I am pretty sure many American candidates like myself were forced to improve ourselves more or less along both our educational and professional development due to the competition with the international talents.

AMERICANS SHOULD NOT BE FAIR OF COMPETITIONS, BUT DRIVE OURSELVES TO EXCELLENCE!
