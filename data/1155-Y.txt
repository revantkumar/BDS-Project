Darren Fisher I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. This policy is a long term benefit in the context of controlling best technical experts in US. They learned high techs, and if they have the chance to stay, they will produce more. But if they have to go back, their home country will soon become strong, since they have learned lots of advanced techs and science.

2. One of the main reason that the US can leading the world is its diversity. We should keep any one who has talent no matter where is his/her origin. Lots of international students are working hard and they will be the real power that boosts the increasing of US economy.

3. There is actually no competition at all. I'm living in Detroit, you can come and see who is actually helping the city, who pays taxes, who is trying to rebuild the city's image. I don't understand why the government would even think about banish these immigrates with high tech while thinking that they could rebuild the community on their own. Current citizens have take so much as granted, my neighbor has 10 children and what they have huge amount of social security and they barely work and they don't care about education. Are you expecting these people to rebuild Detroit?

What we need is the real talent, not free rider. People should know that they should fight for there life, not waiting for free meals. Helping the immigrates are helping this country!
