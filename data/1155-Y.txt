Hello,
I totally support the decision to extend 17 month STEM extension to 24-month Stem extension. It is a win-win situation for all the parties involved.

However, I strongly urge the DHS to take strict action against these fake consultancies who claim to provide visa and jobs to international students at a commission. 
These consultancies are having a huge network. They partner with application advisers in foreign countries and make students apply to such universities which are in a way only oriented for international students. These universities pay high commission to these consultancies for each admission.
Because of these things, an able international student lags behind those who use these illegal methods.

I, being a prospective international student, strongly urge you to take stringent action against such people. It would benefit everyone involved if some universities which are only oriented to give a visa to international students so they can enter US somehow are banned from STEM list.

This step will actually let only the bright minds from around the world to come US, and will benefit these bright minds as their visa slots wont be fulfilled by those who are filing 3-4 fake applications via illegal consultancies
