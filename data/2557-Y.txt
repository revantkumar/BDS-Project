Linda Jian Dear Sir/Madam, as a graduate student who now work under OPT program and will need the STEM to go through the H1B process next year, I strongly support this proposed rule. The reasons are as follows.

Firstly, according to NAFSA, for the 2013-2014 academic year, international students and their families at colleges and universities across the U.S. contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy and supported 340,000 jobs. (http://immigrationimpact.com/2014/11/19/international-students-add-billions-u-s-economy/) It's a great contribution to the economy regarding the education, travel, technology and other different aspects. This rule would be a good appeal to potential students while no STEM would definitely affect potential candidates' choice. More students would bring more revenue and more job opportunities in various areas.

Secondly, it is the trend that the whole world going international. Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010, according to the Partnership For A New American Economy (http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf). This rule will provide people in United States an opportunity to work together to make progress.

Lastly, most people used STEM to cover the time to wait for the work visa. The revoking of STEM really hits us all of a sudden as the end time February 16, 2016 is just in the middle of an embarrassing moment. The working visa would not start until April. It's really a big problem for us now working.
Thank you so much for your time and really hope this rule would be supported.
