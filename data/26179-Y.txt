Some people argue that international students take jobs and opportunities away from American people, but the truth is, many companys enroll only US citizens, so there is NO POSSIBILITY that Americans who are competent cannot find a job. Besides, we all have to admit that not many Americans would like to work in these fields, how many US citizens studying in CS /EE classroom? See? All people have a right to choose any major, but actually most Americans may be not interested in these guys. What's more, the spirit of American encourage all elites to be better and give them chances to succeed.
