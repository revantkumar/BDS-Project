You are taking jobs from Americans and giving them to foreign students who use them to stay in this country instead of going back to their home country to use their knowledge. This is an advantage to employers, but is hurting the social security fund as there is no FICA taxes being taken from the foreign student's salaries. This is an insult to our country, our young people, and our seniors and those who depend on these funds. Please stop any expansion and actually, I would be for stopping the plan entirely.
