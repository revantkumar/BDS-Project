Dhiraj Patil Hi,

The training period (OPT) should be extended IMO for the reason mentioned below,

1. F-1 students work for someone meaning they contribute to the growth of this country by doing the work they are expert at and also by paying the taxes and abiding the law.
2. F-1 students who have taken education from one of the institute which is a part of US Education System proves that they have the potential/ability to improve the world in some way.
3. F-1 students are not illegal immigrants who came here to take away something but they are here to give what they have.
Now, from US perspective,
4. Right now, there is a huge gap between number of H-1B Visa Applicants and number of people who get their H1-Bs approved, which is going to affect US Economy very soon in future because all the talented people will go back sooner and there will be a lack of workforce to do the skilled work which puts US ahead of everyone every time.

All these above points are verified by a number of surveys and have got solid proofs so please help in Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students.

Thanks,
Dhiraj.
