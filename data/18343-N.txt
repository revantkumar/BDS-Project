I have worked in a US Embassy and handled thousands of immigration cases during 17 years, way back in the '70s and 80's. The US Immigration laws have been historically connected with the employment-unemployment numbers. If unemployment within the US was higher than 5%, there was no room to let more immigrants get in the country. the regulations changed immediately to stop foreigners from getting any type of visa. It had been the case for many, many years and it should continue to be this way NOW. Why do they want foreign students to keep benefiting from the life in the US? What about the citizens who are paying taxes (if employed) ? It is already a problem to make sure that nobody is staying in this country longer than authorized... how can a stupid president make things more difficult and unacceptable with a simple "executive order"
