I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training
program. This expansion would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates.
The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least
nine months in the U.S. artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science,
technology, engineering and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for
all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because
they do not have to pay for employer portion of payroll taxes on a prevailing wage. It also could violate the
foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree.
Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.
