I think this 24 months extension is extremely helpful to international students who want gain more real world experience after graduation. As we know the obtaining H1B now is more difficult than serval years ago which means employees barely want to offer a opportunity to international students because of the H1B issue without 24 months extension. I think this is also a double-win case for US government since there are still a lot of technical vacancies.
