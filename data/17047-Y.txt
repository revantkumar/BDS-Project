I strongly support this proposal and hope it will be effective before February 2016 when the old OPT extension rules are revoked. As a STEM F1 student, I think it very important and necessary to extend the 12-month OPT by 24 months. Since 2013, H1B went for lottery as the number of H1B petition became much more than the number of H1B positions. This year, the nubmer of H1B petition is almost 3 times the positions provided. A lot of students did not get drew. And a big portion of those students have been working under OPT for almost a year. If the OPT cannot be extended, they will not be able to continue their job and will have to leave U.S. as soon as their OPT expires. Extending OPT to another 24 months can allow them to take the lottery two more times. From the view of the hi-tech companies, these students have been working for a year and have become very familiar with their jobs. They are more experienced than new graduates. If they have to leave, companies will have to hire new employees and will have to train them from the very beginning. Keeping the old employees in the current position will be much more efficient. So extending OPT by 24 months is really necessary for both students and companies. Don't let these experienced and proficient students leave just because of the work permission.
