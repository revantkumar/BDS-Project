Karthik Peddu Dear Honorable Officer,

I strongly support OPT and the provision of an extended OPT period for the STEM Majors. It would be beneficial for all the international F-1 students to gain the practical work experience after completing their post graduation. I am very much excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT extension increased from 17 months to 24 months in this proposed rule. I take the pleasure of commenting on this proposal as it would be beneficial for an F-1 student like me.

As an international student and STEM graduate, I like to see this rule published and implemented without adversely affecting the 1000's of Highly skilled and Highly motivated students in F-1 status who are contributing to U.S.A technology improvements and economy as a whole.

Finally I would like to thank DHS for providing me an opportunity to share my opinion/comment on this proposed rule.

Thanks,
Karthik Peddu
