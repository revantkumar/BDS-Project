I firmly believe that the extension of OPT will greatly benefit the US society. First, the longer OPT period helps US to harvest the talent it invests in. Nowadays more and more international students have been admitted to the US institutions for undergraduate and graduate study. A good amount of them get scholarship or stipend for their study, especially for the students in the top universities. Cutting the time international students can legally work in the US means that the US is encouraging them to go back to contribute to their home countries after this great amount of investment upfront from the US government/ organizations. This does not seem like a smart deal for the US. Second, keeping more international students in companies and teams can greatly increase working diversity. Since the US economic is getting more and more global, adding more international perspectives can only do good than harm. Third, the extension of OPT does not post any threats to the US economy. Now the unemployment rate in the US already drops below 5% and it is projected to become even stronger in the near future. Therefore, there is no need to be concerned with threats to the US employment market as some people propose. Fourth, when post-graduation employment odds is not as welcoming as before, a lot of international students may decide to go to other countries instead of US. This will greatly cut a lot of revenue that educational institutions currently collect from international students. In summary, the benefits tremendously outweigh the threats for extending OPT for international students.
