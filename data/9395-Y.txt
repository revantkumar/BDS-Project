Qiang Li I support this rule. I'm a college student from China. I'm choosing school for my PHD degrees.If this rule does not pass, I will study in Canada or Australia, because I would like to have enough training time before going back home. If this rule pass, I will study in the U.S. by all means. I think many international students, like me have the same thoughts. I have traveled to the U.S. and I would like to study there, so please pass the rule
