I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S..

3. STEM extension means lower cost and more resource for the technology companies. Next generation technologies will bring down the living cost for everyone and create more jobs for America.
