We no longer have a president but a dictator that does whatever he pleases. If Obama doesn't like a law he just disregards it & makes his own. The Constitution & rule of law means nothing to this dishonorable man. Unfortunately we have a spineless Supreme Court & Congress. Our press which is supposed to be the watchdog of government is part of the Obama regime. It's a sad time to be an American when illegal alien invaders are protected by the government instead of citizens.
