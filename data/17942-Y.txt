It is absolutely unfair, it is injustice, lawlessness for people who are not in STEM programs.

So many student comes to the United States with their american dreams with degrees in majors other than STEM, they are looking for freedom, fairness in the united states, they hope to make contribution to this country with their own advantages and their specific skills in their majors, however, many of them are not in STEM.

So I think it is unfair for people who are not in STEM programs, the United States is a country with justice, the United States should provide the whole group with same opportunity, rather than providing STEM more privilege.

As a student in Global Culture holding a master degree in the United States, i think in international affairs, we should continue to uphold justice, oppose hegemonism, maintain world peace and stability and promote common development of mankind rather than STEM's prosperous.
