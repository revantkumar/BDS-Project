Xavier Xin I am supporter of OPT extension.

The government has to realize that the best way to keep talented students staying in this country and contribute is to offer them a stable development after their graduation, and a working permission with longer time is definitely one of the best ways to do that.

Besides, OPT extension is uniquely offered for STEM majored students, not all international students in the US. Those international students whose majors are not in STEM will not have much impact on local employment rate.

And as we mentioned unemployment rate, lets talk about it. I have to point out that even though there are increasing number of international students coming in to the US from the beginning of 21st century, unemployment rate in the US in 2015 is 5.00%, compared to 5.10% last month, 5.70% last year and nearly 8% in 2011. This is lower than the long term average of 5.83% (the above data comes from https://ycharts.com/indicators/unemployment_rate). This has clearly shown that international students do not have much terrible impact on the local unemployment rate. For those who are complaining about international students are taking their jobs away, you blame the wrong people.

Finally, please notice that so many famous scientists and engineers who are contributing their expertise to the development of US used to be international students. Sundar Pichai, Amit Singhal, Steven Shih, Salar Kamangar I can list millions of them. They all used to be benefited from the OPT extension policy. And because of the existence of them, millions of job opportunities in companies like Google, Facebook have been created. 

Conclusion: This will be an all-win policy, and international students are not going to impact the local unemployment rate. On the contrary, companies funded by talented international students will definitely create more job opportunities and make the US a greater country.
