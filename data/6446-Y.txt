I strongly recommend US government to extend the OPT for foreign STEM students. Not only because those students are outstanding academic achievers who are capable of contributing their labor and talent to our society but also because the attractive opportunities of getting a job will encourage even more STEM students to leave their country and seek educational experience in U.S.,which will benefit our economy in both the short run and the long run.
