I strongly support the new OPT extension rule. 
An OPT extension would allow outstanding graduates to have enough time for high-impact projects that can bring great benefits to our country. I work at a national research institute, and have fully observed that, talented international graduates are key to our success. Our projects involve optimization in mechanical engineering that could save energy and mitigate pollution nationwide. These projects need talented international graduates who have very solid science and engineering skills. These projects typically need about 2-3 years to complete, or even longer. Without an OPT extension, we will face great difficulties in attracting the best mind in the world.
Also, the proposal will keep US academic sectors globally competitive. Many top international students choose to come to our country for graduate study because we can provide the best training process, and an extended OPT is a key factor in this process. Other countries such as Canada are recognizing the fact that educational institutions need international students to compete in the global race for research talent. We would be losing the race if we do not extend the OPT to attract outstanding students and researchers around the world.
Furthermore, I notice that most people who oppose this proposal claim that international students are taking jobs away from US citizens. This is not true. Our e-verify program ensures that employers evaluate candidates regardless of their national origin or citizenship status.
