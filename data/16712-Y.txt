I strongly SUPPORT the expansion. Citizens who were worring about having more competition misunderstang how h1b was given. As international students, we need to have strong academic background and other experience in order to be hired. It is a positive and fair competiton. We were not native speaker at all, if we put effort on a second language and we successfully learnt things better and quicker. Why cant we be given a chance to get a job?
