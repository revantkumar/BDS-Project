I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. When foreign students study in America, they promote economic development because they need to 
money there.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S many foreign students do great contributions to American society in academic area and industry area.

3. Many companies just cannot find appropriate local people to work for them. Foreign students may fit their needs very well. This will help local companies in America to develop much better.
