Chaitanya Yaddanapudi International students come to USA to get top notch education and we also want to take our class room knowledge into real world by working for organizations in USA. There might be some cases where students come to less reputed universities with main motto to work in USA. But that is not the case with ALL the internationals students. USA has large intake of international students into the highly reputed universities. International students even spend alot lot (almost 3 times) the instate tution fee with main intention to gain knowledge in class room and then to put them and contribute to USA by working for organizations here. 

Almost every top notch university has about 80% international students. We are contributing alot to the economy of USA. If the extension is cancelled, it will for sure effect the percentage of applicants to USA and it will for sure effect the economy of the country. 

USA as a country is very welcoming for the internationals and we have high respect for the nation and the people. We are hoping that USA continues to do the same by giving the extension for 24 months.
