I strongly agree with this rule, and I think it's necessary to America.

OPT extension attracts many international students to study in America, and International students pay a lot of tuition fee every year to American universities. It is a necessary part of American revenue. If International Students in stem field can't apply for OPT extension after graduation. They may not choose to study in America. Therefore,United States will lose a lot of tuition fee from International Student every year.

Besides, international students will travel in American, shopping in American and having dinner at restaurant, this is also a considerable income to America. 

My landlord is an American people, I rent his house and pay for his rent every month during my studying in America. He can earn my rent from me. So, OPT extension can benefit US citizens indirectly in this way.

At last ,Diversity is very important for the U.S. U.S. employers will benefit from the increased ability to reply on the skills . For example,facebook, google and Uber and so on want to open Chinese market and other countries' market. So they need those employers who are come from China and other Countries. They can know oversea market better in this way.

Therefore, I hope this rule can be approved as soon as possible.
