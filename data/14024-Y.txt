Personally, I think this proposed rule is proper and should be taken into action. I strongly disagree some comments saying that international people make US citizen couldn't find a job. 
People with STEM degrees are looking for jobs in high-tech areas. There is only a limited number of positions available. All jobs are available for US citizens. And some jobs are only for US citizens. 
Also, there are strict rules of OPT. People with OPT can only work in the area they have a degree. Therefore, there are only a small amount of people in each area, since there are hundreds of majors exist.
In summary, I strongly support this proposed rule.
