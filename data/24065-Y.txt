Many Americans graduate each year with a degree in STEM. We as a country need to provide them with the ability to obtain work in their field of study before any foreigners are given the opportunity to have the job. Our young people have worked hard and paid a hefty price for their degrees. Americans should and must have the jobs! Stop promoting foreigners over Americans!
