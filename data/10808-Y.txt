I definitely support this rule because it can benefit US and countries which F-1 students come from. 

Take my Chinese friend as an example. I am a Chinese and study as a PhD student in West Virginia University now. One of my Chinese friends were studying in Civil Engineering in the same University. Only three PhD students in his group now, other two guys are American. One important program in his group is cooperated by faculties in US Universities and China Universities. At the beginning of this month, it was required one US PhD student to go to China for two months to communicate with Chinese cooperators about the program proceedings. But two American PhD students would not go to China which is a truly unfamiliar with difficult words. Besides, two months for them is too long, they would like to stay with family other than go to an unknown country. They think that is really a tough work. However, if no student goes to China for the program, there should be some unmatch of work in both US and China Universities, or some issues which will affect the program. At last, my Chinese friend was assigned to take this task. Chinese is his mother language and he is familiar with that place, he can talk to Chinese professors with total understanding. The employment of foreign students is helpful for the programs which are cooperated between US and other countries. 

As we all know, China is becoming a giant country in the world. More and more cooperation between US and China will be assigned in the future. More and more people who are familiar Eastern and Western cultures are needed. Most of these people are from F-1 students studying in US, especially those students involving in STEM. For most companies, it is much cheaper to employ F-1 students than training native American employees. At the mean time, the STEM students can conduct the work well.
