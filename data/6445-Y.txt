The Honorable Jeh Johnson

Washington, D.C. 20528

Dear Mr. Johnson:

I am writing you this letter regarding the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. I completed my graduation at the Texas A&M University. I and many of my colleagues will be affected strongly by the Proposed Rule.

I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I'm particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months.

I am very worried with the possibility that the STEM OPT Extension might be disrupted by recent court actions, upcoming court actions, and delays in this rulemaking process. I commend DHS for working quickly to prepare this new Proposed Rule.

Thank you for all of your hard work in keeping America safe and I appreciate for giving me an opportunity to comment on this proposed rule.

Best regards,
