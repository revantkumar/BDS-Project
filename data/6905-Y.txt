Anonymous Anonymous I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I don't see why is anyone is against this. These are highly skilled students that we are talking about. Fewer students are going to college nowadays, not to mention hard science!! How are we supposed to compete against other countries in the future!? A bunch of sports fans? come on..... 

It's not giving out citizenship for free .... they will leave if they can't survive, no matter how long is the OPT .... survival of the fittest ... simple like that? Give them a way to stay longer and those who survived will contribute to the entire country.
