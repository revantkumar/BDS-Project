Of course it is a good policy, not only for the international students, but also for American economy and American citizens. America has immigration culture and that is why United States can keep so many talented people and become the greatest country in the world. What's more, a lot of jobs that need STEM students because a lot of American citizens do not study in the majors like science and engineering. But these high tech industries play an essential role for the development for the country. Keep these international students in this country and have them contribute the country is a wise policy and do not cause conflicts with American citizens' benefits. 
Overall, OPT extension is a good policy for United State's economy and growth.
