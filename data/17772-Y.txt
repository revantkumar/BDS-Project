This proposal for expanding STEM OPT period into 24 months is definitely a great idea, not only for these international student, but also to the companies who value their employees. It also does great benefit to the US economy as well.

Working in a pension consulting firm, I could definitely see lots of international students doing great work in our field, especially students majoring in Math and Science. They bring great ideas, strong academic specialty, as well as multi-culture to the company.

From the prospective of a company, we do not want to lose any employee who has paid their efforts in fitting in the position, and bring value to the company. We put lots of time and value on training each of our employee, international student new hire included. It would be a great lose if we cannot have them any more after a year or two. They have been very familiar with our work, our culture, and our system, and losing one of those employee would not only hurt the company financially in short term, but also would be a lose in long run.

In addition, these group of STEM students have been important resource for US economy. They have learnt so much from our higher education system, and it would be meaningless without them to practice their expertise, or giving back to the society. With their work, industries like computer science, financial service, engineer production, etc. have developed so much. Taking this extra extension period could let these students to devote more to their industries.

Some people may argue that it would be a hurt for US people to find jobs. However, this won't be the case. It's actually a stimulus to the job market, and for more students to develop their skill more so that they can keep up with the competency. It's not the matter of the total number of people in the job market that will improve our economy, but the quality of the work that these young professionals put in their future work.
