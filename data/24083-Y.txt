I support this rule and I don't agree with some of the previous comments which object the enforcement of this rule. Most of the people who are influenced by this rule is high quality labor that help the United States economy grow. Subjects like math, physics, computer science have limited number of domestic workers. It won't replace domestic workers with foreign workers because most of the US citizens are not working in science and engineering fields. Besides, almost all the current US citizens are descendants of foreigners years ago. The developed status of the United States shows the importance of high quality labors in the past and predicts that in future.
