I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. I have elected representatives to address this issue and it has never been brought before them.

This expansion is a needless affirmative action program that is stealing jobs from US citizens who are college graduates. Follow the money. This program creates an incentive for companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens. In fact, there is never a time when that would be appropriate. Companies can train US citizens instead of being given a tax break to hire "qualified" cheap labor.
