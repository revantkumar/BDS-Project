The greatness and leadership of the United States of America, has been contributed by immigrants from the world since the arrival of Mayflower in 1620. In the more-recent time frame after World War II, the United States has been in the leading position in almost all perspectives of our human society, with the talent and genius brought in by immigrants. Some of the notable examples include Theodore von Karman (aerospace engineer and physicist), Albert Einstein (theoretical physicist), Igor Sikorsky (aviation pioneer). The success of USA is based on the united talent of people from the world.

I strongly support the OPT extension program as I believe this will continue to benefit United States in leading the human species.
