This proposed ruling by DHS makes no sense when we have American college graduates who can not find a job. How can Americans compete against foreigners when the foreigners receive a lower wage and the employer gets a $12,000 bonus for each one, and does not have to pay taxes on them. The only ones who benefit from this is sham deal is big business - payback for all the lobbying and financial donations. Americans lose and so do the foreigners - but at least they have a job!

I have no skin in this game - but a game it is to bring the US into a third world status by impoverishing our citizens. As usual, our President favors foreigners over Americans. Who is going to pay for these give always to foreigners and big business - not them - but the few of us who are still working and those who live on a fixed income - like me.

Seems to me that this is not the job of Homeland Insecurity to make these decisions without moving them through Congress, but now Congress is just a figurehead because our President does not follow court rulings but makes his own rules.

I love my country but it saddens me to see those who try to follow the rules, keep their families together and hold down a job are being punished. We can't all live on welfare.

I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.
