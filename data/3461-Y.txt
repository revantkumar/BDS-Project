I support the extension of the OPT. Some people disagree with the extension because they think the foreign students take away the job opportunities for American citizens. I would say it is not the case according to personal observation. I think it is a complementary. Foreign students can fill in the gap between the available high tech workers and the need of employers. I think the reality has explained this: If the high-tech companies can hire enough American citizens to work for them, why would they bother hiring foreign students for whom the employers need to make additional investment? I think it is because the employers cannot find enough American citizens to work for them. Foreign students can obviously fill in the gap.

Besides, canceling the extension of OPT or even the entire OPT program may seriously hurt the incentive for international people to come to this country, because for most of the international students as far as I know, working is an important part of their plan. I come to this country because I know that US is a country with international culture and I have chance to be exposed in an international cultural environment. If the foreign students do not have any chance to work here, the international environment, or in another word, diversity, would be damaged a lot.
