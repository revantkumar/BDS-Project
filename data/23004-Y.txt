I think having a STEM extension period to 24 months is a very beneficial rule not only for the current students having a STEM degree, but also for the US employers as well. 
It enables the companies to pick brilliant, well educated students and recent graduates who have studied in some of the best Science and engineering universities in the US. This also provides the students who have studied here and invested the time, effort and money to learn more as well as contribute to the US economy. Should this rule not be implemented, there will be thousands of students who would have to return back to their home countries given the small cap of the H-1B visa which seems to be getting more application every year. Should this rule not pass, many students from all over the world would shun the US universities for Science and technology degrees.

I hope that everyone recognized the benefits that this rule provides to the students, employers as well as the US economy and is passed at the earliest.
