I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. 

As an international student, I chose America instead of England/Germany to persue my master's degree because compared with other countries, studying in US offers some great benefits, and the most attractive one is being able to work in US for two years after graduation, even paying out of state tuition.

If in worst case scenario the extension practice is void, it'll be a great loss to many companies which currently has students in OPT/OPT extension status.Not only student have to leave their current job, also company have to spend more than half a year to train new hires especially in technology companies. 

Overall, I support it because this rule is attractive for students looking for advanced studies, making contribution to education industry and technology industry.
