This rule is very necessary.
International Students who are passionate about higher education and look for better work opportunities apply to many US universities and work hard to get admission. It takes three years on an average for a stident to graduate a master's degree. Not many companies offer sponsorship. So students make best use of their OPT to apply jobs and work hard. 12 months is an inadequate time to obtain sponsorship and stay in US. Cancellation of STEM will affect more than 50,000 current students and not to mention, their families too.

To make dreams of current and future international students come true, STEM extension rule should be implemented.
