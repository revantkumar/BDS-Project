Diana Nash International Students added a whooping 26.8 billion dollars to US economy in a single year of 2013-2014. I think this is a great step by DHS which would definitely promote new inventions and innovations in field of science and technology. Providing more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Hiring international students does not mean stealing jobs from Americans. I personally did not see ANY American students with STEM degrees and decent GPAs get unemployed.
