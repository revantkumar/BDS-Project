I write to you regarding the Notice of Proposed Rule making (NPRM) on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. I am a graduate student -International from University Of Houston-CL, 70% of UHCL graduate students are international students and a vast majority of those are in the United States on F-1 visas in STEM Courses. 

I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I'm particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months.

OPT and OPT extension is important to be because I will be able to work and get practical training in my field
It will let me live my US dream, Most importantly this rule will affect lot of people like me and future students who wants to come here might not be as interested as the tuition is very high and going back to home country with out working will decrease the chances to clear their debts of education loan. 

There are lots of jobs in this country with shortage of people and the economy is just getting better, Most of the students are really hardworking and talented and deserve the job they want to do, International students pay out of state tution which contributes to the economy and they give good business to surrounding areas like Residential communities (Paying Rents), Phone, Wi-fi, Laundry, Banks, Interest on Credit Cards, Air tickets, Parents visiting for Graduation, Tourism and so much more

Also, The mentor program should be removed as it will only cause additional burden to the employer and the manager might not even be interested to take additional responsibility to sign on my behalf

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule and thank you for all of your hard work in keeping America safe and providing educational and training opportunities to F-1 students.
