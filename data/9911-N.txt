The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.

How about making sure American workers have the opportunities they have worked hard to earn. This would allow them to repay their student loans and become a functional part of our society. Their earnings would be good for the economy both in spending and taxes (which I know you love ). After all, they are AMERICANS and should be considered first instead of foreign workers, or doesn't that fit in to your agenda. OUR government should look out for OUR people first.
