The current OPT program has never been authorized by Congress. Under current immigration law, F-1 visa holders are NOT allowed to hold a job after graduation, and they promise to leave within 60 days of completing their coursework. As bad as this program is, it should NOT be expanded. Stop attacking America's STEM workers to replace them with lower paid foreign nationals. It's not even legal, so don't expand it.
