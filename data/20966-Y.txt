I strongly support extending the OPT period for STEM student. 

Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) concern that three out of four American with STEM degree do not work in STEM field", let me point out that, to solve this problem requires time, such as a decade. This problem cannot be solved in a day and stopping work permits to foreign STEM graduates will worsen this problem, it will just halt the job and economic growth. Moreover, U.S. policymakers can take benefit from foreign scholars to advance its STEM programs and domestic STEM students.

Allow foreign STEM graduate students to move from OPT to temporary residency status. They will stay in temporary residency status for 3 years, where they will work in their field and if necessary will pay 2-5 percent additional income tax to fund US STEM programs from K-12 level. After three years, upon checking work history and tax history, STEM foreign students will get permanent residency. The policymakers should allow foreign STEM graduate students freedom and let them love this country as Americans do. It help American economy and education system.
