Getting a chance to have work experience for those international students is more than icing on the cake (US MS degree). Being an international student I know how much advance the work culture of USA is which gives a very positive impact when we back to our home country. This again encourage more people from different countries to pursue for higher studies which is better for both side (economically & knowledge).

Another benefit I see that those eligible student doesn't need to rely on limited H1B seats for getting work exp in US.
