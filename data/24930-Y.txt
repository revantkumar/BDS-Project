I strongly SUPPORT the proposal of expanding OPT. As one of the many PhD students studying in the United States, we are contributing a lot to the country in both economy and technology. All the students with STEM degrees are the best from their homeland and they can contribute to the country with their creative work. It will be so wrong that the government reject us.
