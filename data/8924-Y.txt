I strongly support this policy. Just consider how much benefit these international employees, who received years of high-quality education and training in the US, will bring to American economy. That's gonna be normals. On the other hand, schools will be more attractive to potential international students. Think about how much international tuitions schools can get for providing better learning facility!
