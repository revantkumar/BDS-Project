This is America!!! Where are American youth graduating from college supposed to find jobs? These foreign students are supposed to return to their home countries after receiving their degrees. They should not be allowed to stay one day longer. This program depresses the wages for all in technology fields just to help these foreign students. Greedy employers will use this program over and over as new graduates emerge on the scene, and America again will be the loser. Our culture and values are already changing rapidly through the massive numbers of illegals coming into this country. This country has been the greatest country in the world in every way. Those in power who want to change it to that like foreign countries should just move themselves to the country of their choice and leave our great country intact!
