Xia Wu I am in support of this policy for the following reasons.

From my understanding of America, Amirica is a combination of people from different cultures and cultures from different regions. That's what makes America amazingly diverse and privileged. When a person stop gaining new knowledge, he will soon be out-of-date. It is the same with a country. When it stops having new blood from different backgrounds, it will soon run out of innovations and possibilities. 

I, as a international student, would surely want to find a job. But after I have a job, I will start paying taxes and potentially creating new jobs. Wiping off others' opportunity to compete is not a way to make you improve yourself, it is just a display of a personal unconfidence. 

I really hope people will have a broad heart and help this policy to be approved.
