STEM is critical to the US and foreign students who got a job in America. The extension of OPT gave them the motivation to work hard and to innovate in order to have the opportunity to get an H1B visa to change their life. Without the extension, studying in the US doesn't make a difference comparing with studying in Canada or the Enropean countries, which will certainly impact on our workforce, economy and even politics.
I applaud to the OPT extension and hope the STEM will include accounting in the future.
