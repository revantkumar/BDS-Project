Annie Riley I would like to say this is an awesome proposal. 

Why do I think so? 

Because I know talents are the most valuable asset in our information era. I believe a lot of young international students fall into the talents category. Note that they are not only talented but always hardworking. They follows rules and principles. I highly recommend that they are given more opportunities (longer training period) to contribute their intelligence and hard work to help better establish our lives. Especially, we need their innovative ideas and strong executive ability to support our tech fields. Thanks.
