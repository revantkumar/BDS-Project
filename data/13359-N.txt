We enforce then remove all people and their families ( if they exist ) if any immigration laws have been broken. 

We have too many real legal Americans out of work to continue ignoring this problem.

We have too many real legal Americans that can not get in schools due to the lack of enforcement of these existing laws.

I seems the current president is NOT helping enforce these laws and or changing them to continue allowing potential terrorist into this country unchecked and then pay them to stay after educating them too!

This mus stop we can NOT afford this expense !
