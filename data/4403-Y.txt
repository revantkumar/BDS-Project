I dont know why so many Americans oppose to this rule and think the STEM students steal their jobs. I would suggest you guys go to the colleges and see how many percentages of American students are studying the STEM majors. Its truth that most of Americans do not like to study STEM and work in these fields, and thats why we do not have enough STEM workers and have to keep the international STEM students working here. Do you think the US government is stupid enough to hand over job opportunities to foreigners but not American workers? Then why they dont hand over Business or Art jobs but only STEM jobs? I think the rational and intelligent things for the Americans to do now is to think about how to make more Americans to study STEM so that we dont need those foreign workers in the near future. Complaining here doesnt make any sense at all!
