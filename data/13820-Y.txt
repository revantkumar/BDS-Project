I support the proposal of expanding training opportunities for F-1 students with STEM degrees and Cap-Gap relief for all eligible F-1 students. 

STEM are high-technique majors that are essential to the fast development of a country and society, yet require deep and solid long-term study. Students with degrees in these majors are generally very well educated and have promising potential to bring huge benefit and contribution to the society. Hence keeping the elite people from all over the world should be beneficial to the country. 

America is one of the world leading high-tech country that provides very good education in relate areas. Attracting and absorbing more students in the STEM to continually work here after graduation is one important factor to keep the fast development of technology, which would improve the economy and provide more job opportunities for both native and internationals.

In addition, international students in STEM majors usually work extremely hard to get the degree, hence they should have a chance to pursuit jobs here, without OPT, they have very little time to find a job. I think it is very important to be open mind and treat people from different countries equally.
