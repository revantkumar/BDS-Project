Improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 non-immigrant students with STEM degrees will benefit both American employers and employees. On the one hand, those students will mostly fill in jobs that have higher demand than available domestic workforce. This addition of qualified labor serves to maintain the growth of their employers and more broadly the corresponding industry. A resulting booming industry on the other hand has a greater potential of producing values and generating jobs. In turn, the overall outcome will be virtuous circle that strengths US economy!
