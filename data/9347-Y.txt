Frank yi I have working for corbion for 7months. I help this company build their automation package by my knowledge. I working hard because I want to contribute to the country. I work hard because I believe US is a place that I can make my dream come true. I have to admit most F1students are working much hard and smarter than some people. That is the true reason most hightech company want to hire us. 
If you told the world your country is the most open and fair place. And welcome people to come. Please be wise and make sure your policy is fair. If you deny the OPT extension, you gonna lose more hightech worker in a long run. God bless American. God also bless the people with dream and work hard.
