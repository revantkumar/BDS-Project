This new OPT rule is very beneficial to the United States. Those who oppose it failed to realize that in many STEM areas there are simply not enough qualified US workers. For example, when Intel come to our university for recruiting, they basically would hire every US PhD students who applied for the engineer position. However, even after that there are still positions unfilled and they need to take in many foreign students as well. Imagine if there is no OPT extension for STEM students, technology companies like Intel would be in big trouble. Without adequate new talents, it would be difficult for US to keep the leading position in technology advancement.
