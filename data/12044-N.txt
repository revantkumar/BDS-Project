I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens. As a US tech worker, I can attest to there being many individuals I personally know that would be more than ABLE to LEARN new skills if provided training opportunities and OJT which is the easiest/most effective way to learn new IT or other skills in this new job economy. As OUR US government SHOULD have a responsibility to care and equip it's OWN CITIZENS for job opportunities, it is important that OUR US government should not open the door for foreigners to have an unfair advantage and allow US corporations to take advantage of these individuals at the expense of our own citizens.
