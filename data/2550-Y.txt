To whom may be concerned,

I would highly suggest to pass the proposal which would allow F-1 STEM students who have elected to pursue 12 months of OPT in the United States to extend the OPT period by 24 months (STEM OPT extension). I assume that the US government is aware that there are big amount of F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees working in high tech companies in US, especially in Silicon Valley after graduation. Among these students, most of them are willing to transfer their VISA from F-1 OPT to H1b, which is the working visa in US. Recent years, since more applicants apply for H1b Visa, and the number of applicants are much more than H1b limit, US government is using lottery to decide if one has the chance to apply for H1b visa. As far as I know, many unlucky STEM studnets failed to win the lottery for two years in a row and they have to go back to their countries. Please keep in mind that usually a STEM student would only have two times of H1b lottery in 29 months OPT. I believe that US government are not willing to lose high tech talents. 24 months OPT Extension could greatly help international STEM graduated students to improve the possibility to obtain H1b Visa (3 lottery chances). Please consider to approve this proposal.
