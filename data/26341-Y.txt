I support this proposal for the following reasons:

1. It is good for attracting more qualified students to pursue career in America. Otherwise, they may be more willing to start in their own countries.

2. Foreign employees are important in maintaining diversity in a company. Without diversity, a company will certainly be less competitive globally. 

3. Reducing OPT time will lead to a lost in highly educated labor force, which will damage US economy.
