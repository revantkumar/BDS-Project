Venkat Jampani First of all Thank you for DHS for creating another rule for STEM OPT Students after Federal Judge comments.. 

Yes, 24 months STEM OPT Extension is must needed to all the foreign national students. 
I see that the citizens are opposing this STEM OPT but there is not valid points for them. Here in Stated there are plenty of opportunities for whomever have talent on their field study. So , I don't agree at all saying all STEM OPT students, H1-B holders are taking away their jobs..

Thank You DHS again for this new role proposal..
