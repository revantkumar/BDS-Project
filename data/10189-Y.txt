I totally support this proposal on 24 months STEM Extension. I saw a lot of objection comments say that international students will take away jobs from American. That's actually very unfair. As I know, a lot of international students in the field of STEM have to do much harder than US citizens to get a job. A lot of companies are even not willing to hire international students. So those US citizens, DO NOT blame on international students for the fact that you or your children could not find a job, it's only because you or your children are not trying hard enough.
