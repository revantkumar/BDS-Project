I strongly support the extension. As an international student, in making the decision of whether to pursue a higher degree in US or other countries two years ago, the 12-month OPT is a huge benefit that outweighed anything else, as it gives me the chance to apply the academic knowledge I gained in a work setting. 

Now working in Silicon Valley, I commute to work on Caltrain. Every day, the train is getting more crowded, with more and more young professionals full of energy and ambition. Among these people, half are international. The demand for tech workers is rapidly growing in this area, extending the OPT period by 24 months is a good way to increase supply. 

Such extension also benefits employers. My OPT expires before April 1st, so I will be having a gap between OPT expiration date and Oct 1st (H1B effective date). I'm lucky because my employer agrees to send me to other countries where they have businesses. But still, it's a painful process for both sides. Not to mention those domestic-focused companies - they will have more difficulties in hiring qualified workers who happen to be international. 

Please let it be the change.
