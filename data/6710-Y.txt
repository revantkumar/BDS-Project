Xiaochun Han Dear Regulations.gov.

I have received my opt extension recently. This is very important for me because I need more time to finish my work in U.S. In my point of view, 12 months of opt for the STEM is too short to demonstrate the ability of somebody to contribute to the society. Specifically they need more high quality papers, work experience and social network. However, these things take time, especially for a new graduated student. Therefore, I think if we keep the opt extension, we may attract more good students and give them a good platform to demonstrate themselves. 

Thank you for your consideration!

Best,
Xiaochun Han
