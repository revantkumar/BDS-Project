chenyin liu the opt extension is good for US, both on economy and culture. International pay much more tuition than citizen,and they also pay for living, which good for GDP on that area. Student performance good but they got less money, which good for company. Internationale student startup company, and they employ citizen, which help more people get job. So, opt extension should apply to every international student, not only which stem major, I hope it can be used for all majors.
