As a person who is dealing with finance, I don't think that it is those foreign students with OPT that make our Americans hard to find a job. Instead, they are actually the fuel of our economic engine. The global economy is really bad now and every country is seeking for solutions. Those well educated and skilled students are definitely one of our solutions. They will produce a lot of value and help our country attract more investments and simply more money. We will then have more opening positions for all of us. Please consider about this proposal in a higher view and pass it.
