I support this proposed rule. For the opinion that this rule will make citizens lose their work opportunity, I completely doubt about this. In a short term, this might be right. But for a long term, if US as a country refuses to employ foreign students, let them go home and use their expertise learned from America to create their own companies to compete with American companies. American companies will have a larger possibility to fail and more people will lose jobs. At the same time, since there will be more openings in the job market, companies will have to lower their standards to hire. This will make American companies less competitive in the world.
