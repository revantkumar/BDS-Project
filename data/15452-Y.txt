I strongly support the proposal regarding 24-month OPT extension. I believe it will benefit US economy as well as science and technology. Here are my arguments.

First, most international STEM students have paid or are paying a lot of tuition to US universities. According to the USNews report (http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/05/07/report-33-percent-of-international-students-in-stem-fields), there are around 350,000 international students who are pursuing STEM degrees. Based on the number from another article (http://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/2013/11/11/us-sees-record-number-of-international-college-students), students from abroad are contributing more than $24 billion per year to the US economy, It is a significant amount of money, which has been used to improve numerous academic programs in US universities other than STEM, and to establish scholarships for US citizens. The STEM program attracts talents and money from the global, which has built an effective ecosystem for the US education and economy. It is a win-tin strategy. If the STEM program is eliminated, international students will not be willing to come here. It's truly a loss to the US.

Second, some people may say those large amount of international students are going to take their jobs if the STEM program exists. It is totally wrong. The STEM program only allows international students to gain off-campus experience in a specific area that is closely related to their major of study for a FIXED period. It serves as part of the university education, not a work permit at all. If internationals students are willing to work in the US, they have to apply H1B visas. Each year, there are only 65,000 H1B visas granted. Given such a small number, I do not think it will have any negative impact on the US job market. In fact, according to the statistics from the US Department of Labor, the recent unemployment rate has reached a historic low record (http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS140000
