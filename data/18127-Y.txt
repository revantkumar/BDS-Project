I support the proposed rule. 

With the current limited number of H-1B visa, only a portion of eligible talented works is able to continue working in the United States. Thus, US employers are facing the uncertainty of human resource and disruption of operation, as a result of losing international employees. Meanwhile, international students also facing the disruption of employment and will be discouraged from working in the U.S. As a result America will lose talented well-trained STEM students. 

STEM is not a filed with labor surplus. For the competitiveness and creativity of the United States, it's beneficial to keep U.S. trained STEM talents in the U.S. To expand opt extension, U.S. will be able to attract more talented students and keep them after give them a good education.
