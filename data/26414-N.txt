This government is supposed to be for the people who pay the taxes and it is pretty much that the federal government does not care to represent the people who make the capital that they steal to force third worlders and other immigrants down our throat. The sad part is that they use our tax dollars against us to do it. I don't want a mongrel race. I like white people and would like to keep them the way god intended. The government is now officially treading on its people.
