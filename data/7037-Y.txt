I support this policy.
Students with STEM degree can make great contribution to the U.S. economy. If there is no OPT extension, it is quite likely that companies will not hire employees who can only work for the company for only 1 year. Besides, there is not enough U.S. local graduates with STEM degree. As a result, many companies may have difficulty hiring employees. It will be a disaster for these companies!
