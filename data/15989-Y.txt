I totally agree with the Opt stems and I think the reasons for those who stand on the opposite position is really ridiculous. First, some people say that the stem students occupy the working positions and make US citizens loss the chances. Is this truth? Absolutely not! Most stems students are do jobs which US citizens unwilling to do, such as software engineer, data scientist, and mechanical engineer. And some people said, though the influence are minor, but the influence is exist! I totally agree with this and I want to say that, the influence is exist, and it is totally positive influence. Because of stems students, in those fields that US citizens unwilling to do, we still stand at leading position. For example, IT field, we have Google, we have FaceBook, we have Linkedin, these companies hired lots of stem students. And stem students are the reason help these companies in the leading position. If without them, US citizens doesn't want to do jobs like these. This companies will be soon instead by the companies in India or China. And at that time, even some US citizens who are interested in these field, cannot find a suitable position. And the hot positions produced by this companies like consultant and product manager will also disappear. So in conclusion, the stem students are the most excellent students in other countries. Most them do the jobs that US citizens unwilling to do. They help these field develop quickly and produce more changes, changes for other US citizens. And help our country stand in the edge of science and engineering. Therefore, stop you stupid negative comments. If you really think they use the chance of yours, why you spend more time to study? I think the company prefer to hire you even if you only spend half of the time in study compared with stem students.
