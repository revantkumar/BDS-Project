Please do not allow foreign work permits until our unemployment figures are lowered. American workers need these jobs.

It is time to put a stop to this practice and put American Citizens first and the companies that want to hire these foreign people last.

The argument is that Americans won't do the jobs. If they are on welfare and refuse to do the job take their benefits away and they will work.

Some Americans have figured out that they don't have to work, this needs to come to and end. If a job is available Contact the unemployment office and make them work or lose their check each month forever if they refuse the job.
