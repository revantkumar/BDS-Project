The extention of OPT is win-win policy for both the country and young engineers. I do not see the policy would reduce the job opportunities for US students majoring in the STEM because OPT is an option for industries to look for additional workers instead of looking for substitutes for US students. For example, in my department (Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Nebraska-Lincoln), most of my American friends got good jobs after graduation (e.g. Amazon, Windows). Some of my friends from different counties do not all take advantage of the OPT. Some of them go back to their own countries instead. The extension of OPT would be a good way to attract the best students in the US. I believe the extension of OPT is also beneficial to the industry of US in the long run. It is important to keep the best engineers in the US to develop new ideas.
