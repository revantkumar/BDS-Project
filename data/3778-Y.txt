I believe OPT-extension is necessary for our country.

Over the years, foreign tech workers contributed tramendous growth to the USA economy. If USA lose this force, USA loses a large portion of growth that the foreign workers bring about. Without policies like OPT-extension, it would just be a matter of time before USA becomes another mundane country where miracles no longer happen. Without the embraciveness of foreign workers, I can forsee someday very soon when USA economy stagnates, people lose jobs, and social problems arises. DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN!APPROVE the OPT-extension.

The request to place the right of citizens over non-citizens is simply RIDICULOUS. Just remember, every citizen or their ancester once was an immigrant!
