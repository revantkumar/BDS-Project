I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for
STEM majors. I'm particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this
proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months.

I am planning to use OPT after graduation. I am very concerned with the possibility that my STEM OPT
extension might be disrupted by recent court actions, upcoming court actions, and delays in this
rulemaking process. I commend DHS for working quickly to prepare this new Proposed Rule.

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule and thank you for all of your hard work in
keeping America safe and providing educational and training opportunities to F-1 students.
