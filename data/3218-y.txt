Zihan Ning International students work much harder than most Americans because they know they are guaranteed to keep their job. And most of them contributed a lot to their companies as well as USA. Americans should not keep the jobs away from international students in a long term's consideration. If international students can't be given the same right to work, USA will no longer be a best choice for international students to study further, college will lose a lot of money, cities will lose a lot of money, then a lot of employees will be fired because of the financial issue. Is that what you want? The ones who says to offer jobs to Americans, could you just improve yourself to compete for the jobs? Are you afraid of competing and what you want is just let government drive away qualified people? Are you just escaping instead of facing? I believe the job market is fair enough to hire qualified people. If you are excellent enough, nothing will bother you. So that will explain why someone argues so strongly. Because they are not qualified and they just want easy exams other than studying hard. Study hard and work hard! Don't lie to the world and yourself!
