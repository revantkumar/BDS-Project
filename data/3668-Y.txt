I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. US needs millions of engineers and scientists to support its long-lasting leading position in the world, STEM students are the sources of these engineers and scientists; 

2. STEM students, especially MS and Ph.D students, they are educated in US with tens of thousands dollars during their study, the money is from US tax payers. If these students cannot stay in US after graduation, then the money is not meaningfully used; 

3. STEM students will increase the competition, it is true, but on the other hand, it stimulates the study spirit of Americans, which is always good for the country.
