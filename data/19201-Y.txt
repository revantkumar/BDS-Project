United States provide a perfect niche for people who intend to donate their piece of labor force to the community. STEM graduates are widely agreed to be the most productive group that can improve the domestic living quality by introducing new techniques, modern architectures and advanced science to practice. I can't agree more about that our society is highly demand on jobs related to STEM and those international students who graduated from these majors are the most energetic and economic source that promote the sustainable development of USA. Please leave a job opportunity for international students who is capable of enduring American Dream.
