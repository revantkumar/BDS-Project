I am a normal Chinese student who is now studying my Ph.D. program at Columbia University. In the period, I am inspired by the excellent academic environment and high technology emerging day by day in USA. So I apply my intelligence and diligence for my loving area engineering mechanics. I have already invented my algorithm for solving problem in material science. It is the time to graduate, and I have decided to make it for practical use. I am confident that my knowledge will make a significant improvement in material design which can turns out a decreasing in economic and environmental cost. But one big concerns of my is that it need time to convert the theory into practice. If no company will support me during this vacuum period (before the real product is available), I can not stay here to make contribution for the material design area in US. It is really frustrating for me since I want to stay in this land and make a difference.
So I really hope I can get 24 months more OPT time to apply what I have learned to make difference in the practical world for United State of America.
