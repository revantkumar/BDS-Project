no matter a human being is a domestic person or foreigner, once he is capable to make this country better, why not giving them an opportunity? people who are willing to devote themselves to the US.

In addition, "all men are created equal", why people hold such big discrimination to foreigners who can do the work better? 

I think making this country a better place doesn't conflict with the purpose of HSD.

I think the purpose of OPT is to give people all over the world a chance to show themselves, to make life better, to change the world they live in. Those people who are willing to leave their homeland, their family, their friends, just for their dreams. On the path of fulfilling their dreams, they need time to grow, to practice, to hone their skills.
if the country don't give them enough time to see what they are capable of, it will be the loss of this great country.
24 months, is not that long, most of the foreign students, they spend at least 2 years in this country, compare to what they contribute, why don't this country give them two years to fulfill their dream?
