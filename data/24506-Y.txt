I strongly support this new OPT plan. Since the international students have made a great deal of contribution for America. First, as an international student, I know the US is the most powerful country in the world. This is because it is diversity in this country. It allows students graduated from american university to do internship here. This policy really attract our international students to study in american universities instead of universities in UK, Canada, Australia, etc. If the government stop OPT plan, I think a lot of international students will select the university in other countries. Many international students have paid a lot of tuition for their study in America. It's good for the universities' income. Then the universities can do better on research by using these money. This is a really good cycle and it is also beneficial for the US citizens since they can get a better education. Secondly, as a master student majoring in Electrical Engineering, I know the silicon valley plays an important role for the whole country' economy. A lot of international graduated students have mad a huge contribution for the development of Silicon Valley. They help to make the Silicon Valley the most creative place in the world. If the government can accept this OPT extension plan, it is really great for keeping the Silicon Valley to be the most creative place in the world. So, I really support this OPT extension plan.
