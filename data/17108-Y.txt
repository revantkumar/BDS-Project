I am in my STEM-OPT extension phase now and working as a postdoctoral fellow. I think this proposed rule is a great forward step to further enhance the research and innovation level of the United States. Many people are arguing the competition of American's job opportunities, but that's a fake argument at all. For most international students, they don't have green card or H1B visa after their graduation. This really limited their chances for many job openings. However, most of international students are very intelligent and very competent for the high level research and technological jobs. If US still want to take the global leading role in science and technology field, this type of new immigration policy is necessary. Think about it this way, US is a country founded by immigrants since the first day of the birth of itself. What makes US so unique in this world now? Immigrants and there intelligence and hard working. So I vote for yes on this proposed rule!!!
