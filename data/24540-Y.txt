I support it.
1. STEM is the engine of American power and competitiveness. If the US want to maintain leadership in the world, then science/technology is a must;
2. The reason why technology companies need F-1 students is the number of US students who study STEM is insufficient to meet the demands of the industries, which indicates that F-1 students have no competition with most US citizens. On the contrary, flourishing STEM related industries can provide more job opportunities.
3. Every country likes talented persons with high ability because they will contribute a lot to nearly every aspect of a country such as economy and culture. A country that does not possess open mind, feel satisfied and rejects to be open is hazardous.
