I strongly support this rule for the following two reasons.

First of all, every job is open to both Americans and foreigners at the application stage. If an American does not get the job while the foreigner does, it is only because the foreigner is more qualified. There is no way to say that foreigners are stealing jobs from the Americans. 

Second, it is unjust if international students pay tuitions, usually much higher than Americans, for several years, only to find that they can work no more than 12 months. Such discriminatory policy will degrade the US as an open country into a money-making machine that tries to squeeze foreign students. In the long run, fewer foreigners will come to the US for study or even travel. As a result, it is the US economy that will be suffered.
