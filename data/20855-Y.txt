I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months because we are both working hard to play a role in this country. I am an international student in Silicon Valley, the place has most talented people from around the world. My major is Computer Science, and I hope I can get a nice job in this place with a lot of innovations after I get graduated to put my efforts into amazing technology field.
