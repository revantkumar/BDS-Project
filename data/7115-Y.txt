Of course, I totally agree with extend the opt extension to three years. As I know, many of my surrounding foreign students are building their own business which render lots of jobs in high techs and business career. Many of the high tech product has been developed by foreign talented people like instagram. As we know, a successful company can not be achieved in one year. Thus the extending opt can benefit US jobs market and economy in the long run and we need them to stay.
