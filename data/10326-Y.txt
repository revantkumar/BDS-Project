In my opinion, the proposal makes a lot of sense and should play a key role in the current recovery of US economy. A lot of US companies are in great demand of STEM employees. However, the US STEM supply is significantly lagging behind the market need. With previous 18 month rule, we observe substantial number of international STEM employees who aren't lucky enough to obtain H1b in the course of their STEM OPT extension. It costs not only the company who hired them but also the social resources that are spent in substituting these job vacancies. Although we don't know what the best number of months should be set for STEM OPT extension, a small step forward (24 months) is certainly positive in terms of solving the economic issue here. Some people may argue that the new rule will cause more job losses to US citizens. However, the true problem underlines in the supply demand theory which implies more international STEM employees are needed for the economy to recover.
