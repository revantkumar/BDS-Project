I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:
1. one of my reason that applying for the universities in United States two years ago is that the government offers me the OPT and its extension to help me get this training session after graduation and I think it's extremely important to attract other foreign STEM talents to bring more creation to this country. If American government cancelled this policy, I believe it will be a huge cheat for all of students who already came here for its extra valuable training opportunity and it's gonna be very harmful for United States' worldwide reputation. 

2. Many of my friends, working in Facebook, Google, etc. relies on this extension to get trained and make contribution to America now, If it's cancelled, they have to come back to China which, I believe, will be a big loss for American industries, especially high-end fields.

3. Competitions do exist, but I believe it's extreme great thing for Unites States for it can be used to motive the native employer to work harder. Also The companies who can hire us international students with OPT are all E-very companies who aim at preventing unlawful discriminatory practices based on national region or citizenship status, so I don't think the extension will create any unfairness. Moreover, United States has blamed China for its closed state for a long time and I believe that US is wise enough to avoid doing the same thing.
