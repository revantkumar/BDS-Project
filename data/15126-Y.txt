My wife works at an USCIS office. And our family strongly supports the OPT program.

My wife studied liberal art in college. It was almost impossible for her to find job, yep where could a liberal art degree get you? But, then she found a government job paper pushing in the USCIS, immigration petition and work authorization.

I was extremely worried that she would not get paid during government downtown. It turns out, all of the legal immigrants pay heft fees for their applications. USCIS operates on the collected fees, rather than tax dollars! So, her work was business as usual even during the government shutdown!

To the people out there, who are quite mistaken, these legal students do not use a penny of our tax dollar. Whoever is telling you that they do is lying to your face.

Our family supports the OPT program. My wife's job depends on the foreigners.
