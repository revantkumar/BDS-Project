An integral part of the tremendous progress in research areas in the United States has been the integration of the wavelengths of ideas and approaches from people from different parts of the world. Reducing the STEM OPT extension will prove as a deterrent to the goal of creating international communities and hencenot allow the generation of wholistic viewpoints in Universities. I believe a 36 month period extension will prove as an optimum incentive for students to pursue research and education in this country and bolster its research acumen.
