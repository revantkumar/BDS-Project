I STRONGLY SUPPORT the proposal.
1. As its known to all, a large amount of breakthrough in technology(STEM!) are made by international researchers in america, which undoubtedly have imposed a tremendous positive impact on economy of US. Instead of keeping US citizens out of employment, this actually is creating more job opportunities! It is really silly to only consider one side of the problem. Overall, Expanding Training opportunities will definitely help create more employment(for US citizens!) and boost economy! 
2. I can't see anything that will benefit employment rate if you choose not to expand it. Why? Because a huge loss of talent people, their knowledges their research and their recourse! Can't imagine what a disaster it would be if those people went to other places say India or China, only for that the stupid policy!
3. A strict policy on training opportunity and employment opportunity of international students will undoubtedly make higher education in US less attractive. After several year, would tech and science in US still leading the world? Maybe talented people have to go abroad to seek excellent mentors and peers. Again, loss of talents! Hopefully that wouldn't happen to your grandson :)
