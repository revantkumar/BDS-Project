This is totally unacceptable! I have a grandson who is a junior in high school who has been unable to find a part-time job to help me with his upkeep. I am on a fixed income (SS) with no chance of an increase this coming year. It seems my government cares nothing for the average American like myself who struggles every day just to stay afloat. It is bills like this that are destroying our basic rights. We don't need to allow this to continue.
