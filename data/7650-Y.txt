I can't agree more with this proposal.The U.S. can hold more STEM talents in the country who can make the country stronger.For STEM students, we won't feel so stressed to make a living in the U.S. after graduation and have to go back home when time is limited.We can then have some time do life planning and better realize our personal value here.It's definitely a win-win.
