Sangeetha Dareddy Dear DHS,
I am supporting the 24 month Extension for the STEM students. This extension is going to help many students along with me to get a higher chance of the employment in the USA. For me the extension would give me an higher chance of getting H1b.

This not only helps me in making my career more beautifully designed but also indirectly gives me a chance to help the economy of USA. The extension is going to effect many students and also few of the people who work in the US who migrated there, this would give a better chance to support their families and also the economy.

Thank you for the opportunity and I hope the result would be the best....
