I dont know why some americans feel they were losing jobs because of International students.You have 5,00,000 jobs pending on Indeed. Try to fill those jobs first.
Ultimately, its not international students that gets benefitted. If you have skilled labour then more companies will invest in USA and that brings a lot of jobs.I don't mean to say that americans are not skilled,but there isnt enough people need who can fill all the STEM related jobs.
