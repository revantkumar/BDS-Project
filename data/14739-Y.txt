I strongly support the OPT new STEM. Nowadays, technology plays an important role in every industry and reshaping the way people think and work. Traditional offline companies also move part of their business online. This trend creates large demand for technology specialist. However, supply of IT people in U.S. is relatively small compared to the demand. An increasing number of students come to America to learn the most advanced development in this industry. They demonstrate excellent academic performance. They are the potential employees we are searching for and can bring this industry more vigor due to their international background. This is why we need extension on OPT. This has positive impact on the IT industry and the development of IT industry will benefit other industry as well.
