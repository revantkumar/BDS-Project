I think the proposed rule will be beneficial to both foreign students and the US employers, specially the ones with very high percentage of international employees. 

With this rule, all the new graduated international employees will not need to worry about the stability of their jobs positions every single year, and the employers will not need to worry about losing a big trunk of their important employees by some random factors (the H1-B lottery process). 

With this rule, not only the employers will save tons of money for training new graduates from schools, but also the employees will be more committed to their jobs without having the risk to be expelled out of the US. Both of these facts will improve the entire economic and the future improvement of the US.
