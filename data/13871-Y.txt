This is a great win-win rule. For companies, they are able to hire more talent, intelligent students while improving their employee training program. For schools, they stay more competitive among good schools across the world, which will attract more international students to invest their time and efforts, trying to contribute to US development. For the country, of course, we need more talents and multi-cultural elements. 24 months extension actually gives them more chance to develop their skills outside school, and leaves the us more chance to select whoever stands out. 

I strongly support this new rule!
