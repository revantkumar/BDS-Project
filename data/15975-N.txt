Americans should have first chance for jobs. Instead of training Fournier's train Americans. 

OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds

To use Fournier's instead of Americans is un-American! Disney is doing that now and making the people to be replaced to do the training. That is a slap in the face to US citizens!

US citizens FIRST.
