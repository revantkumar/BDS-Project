Well,this has been quite an issue among my colleagues recently.People who are against this definitely do not know how the STEM,more specifically, IT industry.The apps we are enjoying, the service and websites our life depend on, are running smoothly and helpfully because of those "OPT" guys. Be realistic, we need them!
Before putting negative thoughts on this, think about "do we have enough staff to keep everything going after we kick out those guys?"
