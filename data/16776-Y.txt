I personally support this rule because, first, instead of earning money, many talented nonimmigrant students really wants to contribute to the society, to the whole world with their knowledge, and they desire more opportunities to prove themselves. Second, it is unfair for nonimmigrant students with equal capabilities to lost their job offers. Third, more and more outstanding students will be willing to work and stay in America and contribute to the economy and development of technology with their hard work.
