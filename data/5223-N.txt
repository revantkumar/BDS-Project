I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) proposal that will expand the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program. This program benefits the powerful tech companies that have an unfair influence over our government representatives, and I believe it will negatively impact the STEM programs in the U.S. Not only have qualified Americans been fired due to the H1-B visa program, but this program is just an attempt to bypass that abused program. It will incentivize tech companies to hire foreign students over educated Americans, and the foreign students may even violate their pledge that they will leave the country after completing their degree. After personally encountering the difficulty American students have just being admitted into a university in California, because the foreign students are taking their place (the universities want their higher tuition payments), it distresses me that they will now be taking their jobs as well. Many recent college graduates are struggling to find work, and this program gives an advantage to foreign students. Additionally, I don't understand why comments are accepted from foreign students; the same students who will benefit from the DHS's proposed rule that will expand the OPT program. They do not vote or pay taxes in the U.S., and under the proposal, they will continue to avoid paying payroll taxes for up to three years.
