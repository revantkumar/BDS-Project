Mengzhu Luo I support the decision of expanding the OPT extension to 24 months. F-1 students have always been a great population in supporting the science and technology fields of US. However, it has been hard for students to pursue a chance to get optional training because of their student status even given a 12 months period. The expansion of the OPT extension period to a 24 months will be a great support to these students who want to get some training after getting the degrees in STEM fields. Therefore, I hope this decision can be approved!
