We should not be hiring foreign students for top paying jobs in America now because we have a weak economy and 
too many unemployed people looking for work. Many are well educated and well trained. If these foreign students
do not pay taxes, how does that help our debts to be paid? This practice does not help our economy. 
Americans should be hired first.
