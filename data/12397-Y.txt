I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.

I am so confused about the people who are not agree with the proposal. As to the opinion that these students are competition to U.S. citizen, which is so ridiculous. Think about who can apply the extension, they are the students who get at least the MASTER degree. These students are highly educated, it should be a benefit for U.S. as these people can make contribution to this country. For example, can everyone work as a Big Data Analyst? Are these people the competition to ALL citizen? Absolutely, NO. They might only the competition to a few of U.S. citizens, which also a good thing to encourage them to improve themselves. Without competition, people will stop learning and improving, which is not good for the country. So we need competition, we need these students here, we support this proposal.

Besides, the extension is just a change for them, everyone still has the equal opportunity to get the job position.
