I strongly SUPPORT this proposed rule because it can help STEM students participate in academic and industrial projects related to their degree for necessarily long time, and hence make more contributions to US academia and industry.

Take me as an example, I am currently a first-year postdoc at a US university working with OPT. My project requires at least three years to finish. If the OPT extension is terminated, then I cannot keep working at the university anymore and the project cannot be finished on time, which significantly affects the research progress of my american advisor (professor) and the US university. This is just my example, one person at one university. Thinking about tens of thousands of international students on STEM extension in universities and companies all over the US, how serious consequence would be if they cannot keep contributing to the US?
