I strongly support this new rule. 
At First, let's recall the very first ridiculous negative comments: "We pay taxes, pay to educate our children then have to compete with our own ruthless federal government for opportunities." We need to PAY taxes for our salaries, and we PAY more than other in-state students in the universities. That is absolutely ridiculous for them to speak in that way.
Also, in my opinions, if this new rule vanish, US are pushing talents out. For international talents who want to contribute to US economy, they ONLY got one chance to apply for a h1b visa, without nothing they can do, just LUCKY. In some field like Statistics, few Americans can be competed for a job in Statistics. Companies lose talents as well as competition in the world. Then students tend to not to go to US for education, back and forth. Universities lose students, as international students' tuition can be a significant part of income. US never want these bad things happen right?
Finally, diversity is very important to US, we come here because of freedom and diversity. There are a huge amount of celebrities in the US that came from another country. International talents come here to help to improve the US economy. For example, Bruce Lee, although he is a movie star, but think about if any rules conducted to push talents like Bruce Lee out just for LUCK.
