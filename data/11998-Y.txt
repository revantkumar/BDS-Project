I'm completely supporting this new rule!

This rule would make American schools and high-tech companies more competitive around the world. Currently, I'm working for a telecommunication company (iBasis) in MA. Actually, the company wants to hire more employees this year. However, the reality is that almost every high-tech companies in the Greater Boston area are hiring people this year after recovery from the economic crisis. And it's very hard to find qualified candidates on the markets, which would greatly impact the competitiveness. 

It is even a good rule for American workers too. The qualified candidates of engineering positions are far from enough. Thus, it is not true that international workers would replace the American workers. Keeping American high-tech companies & schools more attractive would be a virtuous cycle in the long term.
