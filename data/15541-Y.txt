STEM is critical for US academy as well as technological companies. Approve it! My voice is approve, approve and approve!

Without STEM, US universities will be deadly less appealing for foreign talents. And, therefore, US academy will gain less research force. Actually, I have been in Singapore, Sweden and Germany. And none of these countries have such a rich research labor as US has. Places like Singapore, mid-east are even have a higher research payment than industry salary and people are still applying to US. Why?? For they have to leave after their research program and all their effort and experiences in their research program are wasted! So they prefer to come to US and pay their own tuition! This is the power of STEM!!!
Without STEM, we will never attract so many talents from aboard and I don't even dare to imagine the future of US science and technology!

Without STEM, the labor supply for technological companies in US will drop drastically! And it is worth mentioning that this is not only for the future supply, many companies will also lose many of their current work force for the lack of STEM support! How would a company survive without man power? How would a company survive when majority of its work force are not experienced, even less qualified? US industry will also be jeopardized! 

Last but not least, STEM people were chosen by US when they entered. Hence, they are supposed to be more talented! They are not just some random person, they are here for they are good. So please take these valuable treasures, don't expel them away.
