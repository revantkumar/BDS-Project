I extremely support this rules for the reasons below:
1.opt rules is helping U.S to keep the smart overseas students serving the country. The foreign students contribute their talent and hard work to this country and it helps U.S be the most developed and advanced country in the world.
2.most of STEM students' work are very tough and citizens do not like to take that kind of job. This opt rule seems to reduce citizens job opportunities but actually not. Because most STEM students are foreign and citizens would not like to take STEM majors and work in these areas after graduation.
3.U.S is a immagration country. It is no reason to oppose the foreign legal students to stay and work here. They contribute their hard work and money here. They should at least to have right to stay here.
