Erum Q Once the rule is enforced, will the replacement of the 17-month OPT extension to 24 month OPT extension be applicable to current students currently on 17-month OPT extension. If this is the case, will those students automatically be given a 7 month additional extension or do those students have to apply for a new EAD. Please shed some light on this. Thanks.
