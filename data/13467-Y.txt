What DISNEY did was wrong. They abused the laws of the land legally. If you go deeper you will see that this new regulation protects American workers. This new rule ensures no American worker is replaced by foreign workers. DHS should ensure that offshore consulting companies like Infosys, TCS, cognizant etc. cannot circumvent these laws through loopholes. They undercut wages which hurts entire economy.

Students by definition need training. It doesn't matter where they are born. American students have same if not more opportunities as they can pass security clearances. Statistically the number of American people who graduate with STEM degrees is low and they do find jobs easily. That is why this rule will benefit the American economy. Nothing stops the highly educated people from STEM fields from just going to CANADA or Australia or anywhere in EUROPE. America needs to retain the talent.

STEM means Science, Technology, Engineering and Math.
