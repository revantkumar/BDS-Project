I strongly support the proposal of extending opt.

According to NAFSA, for the 2013-2014 academic year, international students and their families at colleges and universities across the U.S. contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy and supported 340,000 jobs. Compared to the previous academic year, this is nearly a 12 percent increase in dollars contributed to the economy and an 8.5 percent increase in job support and creation. The opt extension would attract the international students and that would contribute to the US economy.

For those worry about the international compete with citizens, competition is good. The international education and exchange program bring benefits of preparing more Americans for a global environment and attracting future leaders from abroad to study, learn, and exchange experiences in the U.S.
