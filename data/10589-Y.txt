I am so glad to see the US government is seriously listening, and the improvement of this rule would not only show its care about smart and creative international students but also show its care about the future of this country. As an international student, I feel very grateful for your effort and I am very happy to meet and learn from people all around the world and hope I could keep contribute to everyone who cares about me.
