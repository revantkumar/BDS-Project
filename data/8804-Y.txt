I strongly support this policy. First, America is made by different immigrants and become so successful due to millions of bright immigrants. If we want to keep our county being competitive, we need those well educated, skilled foreigners to contribute in science, engineering fields. Secondly, lots of immigrants started up their own business after their training opportunities which produce lots of jobs for Americans. Thirdly, I live in a college town and I know these international students are contributing big part of our local business now. I want to keep them so the local business can develop. Although I support these legal immigration policy, I do want our government restricts illegal immigrants.
