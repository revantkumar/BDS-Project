I support this rule.
Why is there a problem now, when there wasn't any when we were paying thousands of dollars to the universities. For a fact we just want to do some thing good here in the US, lets not see this as if we are taking away things from Americans. Employers aren't just handing away the jobs, we are earning those jobs. If some people cant handle little competition then what good is it being a citizen of one of the most developed country.
