Jie Ren I didn't see the reason why should people oppose this rule. It's purely beneficial for economics in USA. More international students will come, which means more income for the federal. And on the other hand, international students will raise their experience with working in USA and then come back to help their homeland. It's a win-win rule. SUPPORT IT!!!
