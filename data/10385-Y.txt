Yue Zhao I support the OPT extension policy.
OPT extension policy is one advantage that attract much more international students in USA than in Europe and other regions and countries. According to U.S. Department of Commerce, international students contributed more than 27 billon to the USA economy in 2013/2014!!! That is a lot of jobs that can support a lot of local families. Without OPT extension policy, less and less international students will choose come to USA for higher education, which means less jobs that will have a huge adverse effect for a lot american citizens. Imagine a collegetown with no international students, the supermarkets and all department stores will have less visitors and thus don't need as many employees as another collegetown with lots of international students.
