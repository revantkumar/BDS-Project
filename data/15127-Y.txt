I graduated as a PhD this year from UC Berkeley. I can find a very good position if I go back China. Choosing to stay here means that I need to worry about my immigration status all the time. However, I choose to stay because (being honest) I like the states and I want to contribute. I want to help improve the country which spend its time, effort, and money on me. I don't understand why you want to go against the extension policy. We, as well educated employees, can contribute significantly to the country. With American Citizens and us, we can build a even stronger US and attract more opportunities. In comparison to internal competition, together we are bringing in more opportunities and can move further.
