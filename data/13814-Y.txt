I support the extension of the OPT. 

Canceling the extension of OPT or even the entire OPT program may seriously hurt the incentive for international people to come to this country, because for most of the international students as far as I know, working is an important part of their plan. I come to this country because I know that US is a country with international culture and I have chance to be exposed in an international cultural environment. If the foreign students do not have any chance to work here, the international environment, or in another word, diversity, would be damaged a lot.
