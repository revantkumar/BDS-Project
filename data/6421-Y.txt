Bingyue Xiong, AirWatch by VMware International students graduated from STEM majors have largely contributed to the growth of US economy over the past few decades in various industries. As there aren't as many native STEM graduates as the market demands, a lot of those international students eventually stayed in this country and continued their contribution. 

With the growing number of H1B applicants (duplicate applications, oversea consulting firms submitting massive amount of applications) and limited quota, a lot of international students who have finished the degree in this country and found a job are having trouble staying in this country legally. The result is brutal to those who have been settling in at their job already. They are forced to relocate just because they weren't selected in the random lottery system which by no means determine the quality and importance of their work. And it is also a great loss to the employers who hire those international STEM graduates. 

Therefore, I think this rule is very timely necessary as the first step to fix the broken immigration system.
