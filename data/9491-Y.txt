I strongly support extend the opt for STEM international students.
Firstly, this proposal will attract more talented students coming to US, thus giving financial support for American universities.
Secondly, more talented students will benefit the economy of America, increasing the work efficiency.
Finally, America is a comprehensive and multi-cultural country, it is reasonable to accept more international students.
