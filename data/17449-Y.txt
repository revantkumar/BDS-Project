I personally strongly support this policy. Some of us just keep yelling as if the international students are really stealing our jobs. But the fact is that they have never done so, and will never do so. The truth is that we simply DON'T have enough STEM students ourselves to work for the industry. To keep it in pace and progress, we need more proficient foreign employees keep coming and working. So let's all look into this fairly.
