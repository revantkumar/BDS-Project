As an international student who got a statistics PhD degree in United States and just lucky enough to get H1B lottery this year, I strongly support the new rules to improve the current OPT policies for F-1 nonimmigrant student with STEM degrees.

With the help of OPT policy, I am able to find my current job as a data scientist and apply what I've learnt in my PhD study to my daily work in United States. Both my employer and I are happy with the value I add to the company. However, many of my international friends with similar advanced STEM degrees and well-qualified for their positions are not as lucky as me. They failed in the first year of H1B lottery draw. I feel it is unfair to them if they don't have more chances to get an H1B and continue their jobs. This is also not fair to the US companies who have spent money to hire and train their international employees more qualified for the job. 

US is an immigration country. Any intent to question this root would weaken the core competence of the country. Most of the international students have advanced degrees with scholarships. They are talent hard workers. The country have spend huge amount of money, time and other resource in educating them. It would be a win-win situation if these people can stay in US and contribute what they've learnt to the society.
