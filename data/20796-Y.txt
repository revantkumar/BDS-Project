I hold the view that this OPT Extension not only is quite important for students whose major is in STEM, but also is crucial to the companies in the US and even the economy of America. As we all know that the economy of the US just started to recover from the last economic crisis. So the STEM extension will definitely help America recover the economy.

Most the people who work in the high technology field are foreigner who make great contributions to the US development. Please give them more opportunities to make more contributions to this country. Thank you.

So I think this extension is needed and necessary. I hope it can be approved in the future.
