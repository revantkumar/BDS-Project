As a student from STEM areas, I strongly support this proposal based on the following reasons:
1. The practical training is an important part for STEM areas. Maybe you can read knowledge from the textbooks. But it is another story when you apply the knowledge into the practice. The OPT extension could give more hands-on skills to the international student, which is a necessary part of the education.

2. The OPT extension is definitely good for US economy, and maybe could create more jobs for United States. After several years' education from universities in United States, they are well equipped with the right skills to fill the vacancies strongly needed by the industries in United States. And due to the prosperity of the industry, more jobs in the industry or in the related fields could be created. It's good for both economy and native people in United States.

3. The OPT extension won't make native Americans lose the jobs. To hire an international student, the company must do some extra work. If the position could be filled by a native American, I think most companies won't spend more to hire an international student. As a result, the OPT extension won't impair the job opportunities for native American students. It will only make international students fill the huge intellect shortage needed to boost the economy.

As a result, I think OPT extension is very beneficial to both the students and Untied States.
