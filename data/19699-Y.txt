I think this rule has both pros and cons. 
Pros are real talented students from top universities in US can stay in US and really do great contributions to US technology and economy. 
However, the cons side is that some Indian outsourcing company will hire much more consultants whose job is very basic and those job opportunities should be given to US young workers. I think this is the part most Americans will will agree. 
As I am a foreign student, I study in U.S. at a top 10 university majoring in CS. I work in a great company and get paid really high. All my friends are kind of same with me, so I did not realize this cons until I see some post in another forum talking about this rule will take up all the job opportunities for Americans. As far as I can see, there are both foreign students and American students in my major, but foreign students are majority in my major. All of us got decent job in US, that's why I didn't see why foreign students stole the job opportunities because everyone gets great jobs! So what really matters is the basic jobs such as some Indian outsourcing companies will hire many consultants doing really basic 
'technology' jobs. US companies should trained young US citizens for these jobs. 
So I think a better solution should be setting a bar on OPT/H1B selection based on annual salary or top 20 universities.
