I FULLY SUPPORT THE PROPOSED RULE. This rule will ultimately benefit the U.S' economy as well as people who are currently unemployed. STEM students, no matter where they come from, U.S. or rest of the world, are highly innovated and skilled. Allowing STEM students to work longer time in the U.S. will definitely create more job opportunities for U.S. citizens, they can even create new companies/industries. STEM students on OPT NEVER get paid the minimum wage, they're paid with at least prevailing salary in their positions. I don't think U.S. techs can afford losing these talent. I don't think those unemployed people can substitute the roles that STEM students do. It is already extremely hard for foreign students to find jobs, expanding OPT is contingent on that they ALREADY have a job and they company WANTS to retain them, the proposed rule actually helps the companies to retain their workforce. 

U.S. is a country made of IMMIGRANTS, and is the land of free. U.S. deserves to be more innovative , more powerful , let's keep these highly talented young people and let them contribute to our economy!!!!
