Du Zhao I strongly believe that the new expanding training opportunities will benefit both the US economy and STEM students. The economy here is driven by the hard work of all people through out the country, not only citizens but also millions of foreigners as an important factor. With all STEM students well-educated, their working ability and efficiency is definitely surpass the average working ability of people within the country, and it is even this case in every corner of this nation besides STEM related field. Also from common knowledge, a better economic environment will keep the unemployment rate relatively low. So from all above, this is really a good proposal for every HARD WORKING one here in america.

And I see some negative comments which I would like to question them. For example, someone said:

1. "I studied mechanical engineering and mathematics in the 1950's and 1960's. I did not need more time after college to be trained. I was trained fully in my disciplines and I held full time, full work load jobs at a full salary. No intern period was required then for technical degreed people nor is it now."

I know neither what situation was back in 50's and 60's nor what did you learn at that time, so I cannot judge you like "You should find a intern job at that time but you didn't, this means you were not good enough to be hired by companies." So please don't judge stduents in 2010's by "nor is it now" since you have no idea what they really need. As I know, each of my american "technical degreed people" classmates has at least one internship experience.

2. "The expanded OPT program will take hundreds of thousands of American jobs and hands them to foreigners."

Just imagine that all "foreigners" in tech companies are ejected from America, do you think it is a wonderful chance for US citizens to take all job vacancies, or it is a disaster to the US economy?
