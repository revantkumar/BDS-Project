I strongly SUPPORT this proposal:

First, there is no doubt that the United States is a country who is build by immigrants. It' s a truth that a great nation should be created by great people. Meaning that people from anywhere of the world could make contribution to U.S. 

It's so PATHETIC for those people who prevent this country's development by only concerning their own profits. They worried that foreign students would rob their jobs. The only thing that they do no pay attention is why they would be threatened.

If you are good enough why you have to worried about giving more OPT time for other young men? 

The other reason is I think in the case of STEM student, it cost more than students from other fields to to be a qualified employee. For most of STEM students, they have 29 month in total but at least using 1/3 it to find a job, they need more time to practice their skills, to involve in the US society.
