The positions offered for training of STEM degree holders should be reserved for American citizens first. Visa programs, such as H1B and F-1 are a stopgap measure and should only be used after every single American citizen interested in the job has had a chance to fill it first. In other words, until the U.S. has exhausted all efforts to find and fill these jobs with Americans, no non-citizen should even be considered for the job.
The tired excuse that American's can't fill the jobs is patently absurd - you're not trying to reach us, you prefer having workers you can lord deportation over in order to get them to work 18 hours a day!
