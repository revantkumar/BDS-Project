I support this proposed rule. The most common opinion to oppose is that the OPT extension will make it harder for Americans to find a job. I always believe that American people are the most brave group people in the world. But it seems people become coward competing with others coming from different countries in an even fair condition. In my opinion, if American government let these students go home and compete from their own country, there is no difference at all. However if that happens, I am totally sad that America is becoming no long the greatest country since it is losing its core spirit.
