Meng Tang First of all, I am in support of the proposed rule on " Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for All Eligible F1 Students". 

The success of US in claiming its top spot in science and technology from Europe during early half of 20th century has been largely attributed to immigrants. With a shift in the landscape of science and technology, the challenge would be to how to maintain the competitiveness. The answer to such question would be to attract the top talents in the world, which is insufficient by US citizens thus requiring talents from the world. STEM majors are very good examples to show that US are in need of foreign students to maintain active graduate program, which is crucial to training future scientists, engineers that could benefit the industry and academia in turn. Denying the opportunity of these graduates into the US job market would be a big loss to the US educational resources in a long run, since the training these students receive would be brought back to their home country and the value of such education is to boost the competitiveness of other countries. The industry are also in need of the graduates regardless of their background. Any form of discrimination would be wrong as history has proved in the case of discrimination against gender, race, etc.
