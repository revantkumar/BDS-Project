I strongly support this proposed rule since this is a win-win strategy for both US and international students who attained or is going to attain STEM degree in US. 

May comments are afraid the new policy will take jobs from citizens. The truth is NO! First, this policy only allow student with stem background, which means this policy is for fill the gaps between company's need and local students skill sets. Many high tech companies are looking for computer science, math, engineering students for the creative ideas and skills. Yes, some citizens do also has this skill, but it's not enough. 11.5 million Entrepreneurs in the US now and most of them require a lot of stem employee. The international student can create diversity and creativity to these companies. And the development of these companies can create more jobs to US. For instance, Uber, the ride share app based in San francisco, it hires many international students when it developed itself. And Uber has gave a lot of new jobs to the US, or even to the whole world. 

US need more tech-company to compete the whole world. And the well educated stem students are the most important part of the developing process. Do you really want them to back to other countries and then compete with US? Do you really want them to create job opportunities in other countries? Absolutely NO.

This new policy will not take jobs from citizens. It create jobs and contribute to US! Therefore, I strongly support this stem OPT extension policy
