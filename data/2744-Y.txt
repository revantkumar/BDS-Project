Sure, I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. It is crucial for International students in U.S. to server U.S. society for longer time. Actually, I think the longer the better.

2. The second reason is social diversity. As is known, America is a diversity country. Many international students made huge contributions to U.S. before they went back to their homeland. So it is essential to give them more time/chances to make contribution to our country.

3. Competition is an important issue of American economy. Our country is facing the talent conpetition from Japan, United Kingdom, India and so on. So, we need to attract more international students to serve our country. As many positions in our country cannot be met by local talents, it's crucial for us to attract more talents.

All in all, the OPT with STEM extention is essential for the long run development of U.S. economy and the happiness of U.S. residents.
