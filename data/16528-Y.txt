I strongly support extension of OPT to 24 months for STEM major graduates. There is a huge gap of STEM major talents in the US, especially in high tech industry. US citizens and permanent residents in STEM major are not enough to power continuous growth of the economic development of US. Having more STEM major students in the labor market will help to create more jobs for US nationals as well in the long term. Extending OPT to 24 months for STEM major students is aligned with the benefits of US.
