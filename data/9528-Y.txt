I do support this extension. Consider those U.S. startup IT companies which eagerly look for high-skilled workers. Without the effort given by those talented foreign people, can the companies find enough human resources to satisfy their need in the short term? Without the first step of these startup companies, how can we get so many great new products like "Fitbit" "Instagram" "Gopro", etc. 

Under the rapid development of the global internet industry, it's a golden time for innovative and talented people to realize their creative ideas. This will not only help those foreign students who want to practice their skills after graduation, but also, most importantly, be helpful to benefit U.S. technology companies. Also, it will create more job opportunities for all of us.
