I do support the new regulation. For those international students in STEM, the most likely way of staying in US longer is to work hard, thus the OPT extension will certainly bring a stable and effecient power for american economy. This is a win win situation for those international students who has great knowledge and skills and for the US government who wants the fresh resource to its economy.
