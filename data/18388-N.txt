This kind of legislation needs to stop. How about Improving and Expanding Work/Training Opportunities for the Already Ample Number of American STEM Workers/Students? This kind of legislation opens back doors for corporations to hurt American workers by expanding the H-1B visa program, with the intent of having access to low-cost, inexperienced, foreign workers instead of competent American workers.

This is, and has always been, done with a view to increase profits and afforded domestic institutions the privilege of knowing that they can exploit new indentured servants in ways that Americans may not tolerate, being assured that the foreign workers could never leave a company during the tenure of their visa.

Colleges and universities want this so that they can charge greater than full tuition to international students, thereby increasing profits at the detriment of opportunities for American students.

We need to stand up for American workers and aspiring students because it is apparent that corporations and government bodies are all too willing to sell out the American people for profit.

Foreign persons do not hold the same rights as American citizens, and they should only be afforded similar rights at the benefit of American citizens.

This is trojan horse legislation and it has to stop.
