Yiming Hu I strongly support this proposal because this proposal is beneficial for the U.S.. With the extension, more students with high education and proficient skills in the most advanced field would have the chance to work in U.S.. Their participation will motivate the increase in technological industries. For example, the artificial intelligence is believed to be the most important technology in the next 50 years or even longer. Most graduate students in mathematics, computer science and statistics are international students and they will play an important role in the development of this field. Opt extension would help them keep working in this field in U.S..
