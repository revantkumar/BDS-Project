I strongly oppose this comments, and believe US GOV should keep the OPT extension.

I don't think OPT extension has anything to do with the minimum wage. I am currently working in a large investment bank on OPT extension. My rate is $35/hr. This is definitely higher than the minimum wage GOV required. According to my experience, all my classmates working on OPT has an rate of at least $25/hr. 

No international students would accept a lower rate like $10/hr after spending $100,000 and working so hard to get a degree in a foreign country. In the meantime, low rate job means it doesn't have much technical requirements. If foreign students can't get any meaningful training through the job, there is also no point for them to waste time on it. Why not go back to their own country and gain experience?

I believe the minimum wage thing is more related to illegal immigration who don't have proper skills to work on difficult job. They have no choice except to accept a wage lower than the government requirement. From both reality and reasonable thinking, F-1 students won't accept lower wage and so that OPT extension has nothing to do with the minimum wage policy.
