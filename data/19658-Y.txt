I personally strongly support the extension proposal. The following are my main reasons.

1. I am from China, but I did my undergraduate study in UK. Then I decided to go to the US for my graduate study because of its favorable policy towards foreign STEM students. This policy is the OPT extension. I believe that a large amount of foreign students choose to study in the US just because of this policy. Without this policy, the US will lose these talents. 

2. America is No.1, it is true. This is not because it wins the World series every year, but because there are so many talented people live in this great country. They work together under its great social system, law system. They work together to make this country even more advanced. I know a friend, who is also from China. He is very talented in computer science. During his opt extension, he was employed by a company. He helped the company solve an long-pending problem and add 1 million dollars to its revenue. He told me that thanks to the long extension, otherwise he could not have enough time to focus on this problem. 

Some people may argue that this proposal may undermine the opportunities for native Americans. I don't think so. This is because most of foreign STEM students are competing for positions requiring advanced skills, which represent America's world competition ability in the world. Moreover, it will also bring more job opportunities for Americans. I know another friend, who after getting the H1b visa, he decided to start an company. This company attracted investment from venture capitals. His company employed about 10 native Americans! Now we see the benefits of OPT extension!

To sum up, apart from bringing positive effect on foreign students, this proposal is by no means bad to the US. I strongly support it.
