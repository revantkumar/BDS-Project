I think OPT should be improved and expanded for international students. It is very understandable that international students may want to find jobs after they graduated. Moreover, it is more difficult for international students to find jobs in the USA. The STEM students who study technology and engineering stuff are more in need of intern and job after graduation in order to practice their skills in the real world.
If the OPT is not expanded, it is unfair to them.
