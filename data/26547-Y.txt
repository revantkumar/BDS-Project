I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons:

1. 12 months are a short period to complete a practical training. Almost some experience with more than 1 year could give a deep understanding. When you put a experience with only 12 months, your employee will ask why you leave. It is awkward to answer that my OPT period is over, which is just as what I am experiencing.

2. Lower payment from US aspect. Foreign students are looking for experiencing and learning opportunity who will not ask higher payment as the same time.

3. F1 to H1B is a process to find some really talent people with technology. It is better to have more person with investment immigration.
