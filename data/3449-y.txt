Scott Hoag Americans are having a tough time finding work as is. This will only add to new grads trying to find work at a disadvantage again. I say no American grads need these jobs more than any foreign student. Giving tax breaks for hiring foreign workers all but ensures that student grads of this country will be over looked. Americans first, why not allow for tax credits for hiring American new grads .
