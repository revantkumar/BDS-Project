I am against expanding or continuing the F-1 Student w/stem degrees & CapGap Relief for nonimmigrant students.
No special arrangements should be made until Americans are given the opportunity to apply first. Why does this Agency continue to
put Muslims & foreigners ahead of Americans. It has to come from the White House as Obama hates America & Christians.

He has made that apparent this past 6 awful years.
