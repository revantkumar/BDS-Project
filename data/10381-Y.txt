International students are the lifeblood of our research universities and the technology sector. We should endeavor to expand their access to American employers by ensuring that all international students who receive STEM degrees from top American universities are authorized to work in the United States for as long as they choose to. Innovation and assimilation are core American values that we must continue to champion in the 21st century.
