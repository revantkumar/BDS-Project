America provides world class education and research facilities to the international student community and helps them become pioneers in their fields. These people then go on to achieve greater life goals like inventing a much needed medicine or save the environment, help fight poverty and hunger via social causes, help bolster the economy through businesses and creating employment. Does any country not want people like these living in their country and serve them with all the talent and dedication? America should not loose out to other countries and it's high time we do something. This rule will help in that way so please pass this rule.
