Sophie Liao I strongly support this new policy. 

Contrary to many concerns, this new policy will actually tend to decrease unemployment rates in the United States in the long term. Many startups are the results from the research conducted at schools, or the coming from various projects. The OPT extension will help students have more time to finalize the results or the products. The progress of related business will bring many job opportunities.
