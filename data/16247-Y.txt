I strongly support the new opt STEM extension policy. 

For one, the duration of opt and the promised opportunities are one of the reasons I came to the US for my PhD. If the STEM is forfeited it would strongly discourage foreign students from coming to the US. It would be a huge lost to the universities regarding the student resources and the financial benefits. It would also be a disadvantage for the industry because of the limited working capability of the foreign STEM students. 

Second, the 24 months period is very reasonable to me. As a biomedical engineering student, our projects generally last for 3 to 4 years. Without sufficient opt duration it would be impossible to accomplish the milestones and achieve the research aims. The STEM extension added up with the opt would be 36 months, providing enough time for conducting a research project. The 24-month extension would very much increase the productiveness in both the research and the industry.

I sincerely hope this new policy get through for the benefit of the foreign STEM students and the US academia and industry.
