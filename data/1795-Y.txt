The current OPT program only allows a 12-month time frame for students to work in the US. With the OPT extension, the student can have another year to find a job.

Allowing the foreign student to find a job in the US will not significantly affect the job opportunities for US citizens. First of all, the extension only applies to the students major in STEM. STEM degrees are only a little part of all the majors across the universities. Most of the domestic students who are not major in STEM will not be affected at all. Secondly, for most of the time, STEM majors have a larger percentage of foreign students than other majors. It is reasonable to allow the foreign students in STEM majors to have more job opportunities than other people. Thirdly, the extension is only 24-month; not 5 years or forever. The students can use this extra 24 months to figure out what they want to do. It doesn't mean all these students will stay in the US after the extension. Most importantly, those foreign students who are major in STEM and can find a job in the US must be very good. They can finish their degree using another language and successfully find a job. Asking them to stay, can make contribution to the country. Some of the STEM jobs are not popular and domestic students don't like to do them. But the foreign student will do it and can do it, as long as there is an opportunity.

Overall, 24-month OPT extension can make contribution to the country, and won't affect the job opportunities for US citizens.
