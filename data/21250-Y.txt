I Support the proposal for the following reasons, 
1. students graduated from the STEM programs, which is challenging, and also aimed towards the needs of US industry. It would save US companies money and time to get the talents they need. 
2. International Students from other countries came from different education and culture background can bring diversity and energy to the working environments. There will be difference, but the world and especially US needs diversity for itself to succeed in the new century. 
3. International Students tends to gain more work experience here in the US, 
will get more experience working with the US, and get to know more about the US culture, which is also what their home countries need. Since When they come back to their home country, they can be hired in a position closely working with the US, which will benefit US eventually.
