It's really a good news for students, universities and industry! 
As a former STEM student, I know the significance of practical training. Without industrial experience, it's almost impossible for future engineers to have a good understanding of what they've learned in college. 
Now U.S. universities have an increasing number of international students, most of whom major in STEM. The new rule would improve the quality and equality of education for those international students by providing more training opportunities to polish their specialties. In return, U.S. would strengthen itself as a global leader in higher education and science & engineering, keep attracting more and more young talents from all over the world. 
They would not only improve cultural diversity and financial situation for universities, but also create housing demand and job openings for local business. Eventually when they graduate and work in U.S. companies, they would contribute their knowledge and creativity to a stronger domestic industry and economy. All of these benefits would hardly exist without an expanding OPT for international STEM students.
