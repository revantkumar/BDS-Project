Joe Martin I strongly support the following rule because first of all, the United States's citizens either have immigrant ancestors or they are immigrants themselves, so it is not reasonable to comment against STEM students who are also immigrants. Second, U.S. companies needs more STEM people,however,number of current STEM graduates are lower than demands.For example, I work for a health care data analysis company.50% people are STEM majors. There is a vital need for employers to act now to secure a steady flow of talent with the right skills in years to come: building more structured training and development schemes and developing clear career pathways are just two ways in which early action can avert future crises. This rule gives enough time to those student to at least prove them selves. That's why I support this rule and we all should.
