I would like to ask our "statesmen" if they are aware of how hard it is for Americans to get work visas overseas? I had two employers who signed a contract to hire me, but I was unable to get the job because of the strict rules against Americans working in their country. However, if I were from New Zealand, Australia, Ireland, Poland, or any other country in the world, I would have gotten that job. Even Bill Gates or Steve Jobs couldn't pass other countries criteria for a work visa.

Study these facts, "statesmen," before you make a decision on this. You are now asking economically oppressed Americans to pay for the limousines for foreigners to ride in, yet forcing Americans, the people who trusted you to represent them, to take a cheap bus. 

What a slap in the face to America! There are Americans who want and need these jobs. 

Rome did not fall from a foreign enemy. It fell from within. America will fall because of "statesmen" like you. You are enemies of our nation.

Thank God for organizations that WILL make you accountable.
