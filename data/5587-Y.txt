I strongly SUPPORT the OPT EXTENSION PROPOSAL, which is absolutely beneficial for the continuous development of the USA. First, extending the opt extension to 24 months is great for the employers, because most of the project in the STEM field takes more than several years. For example, at least 2 years are needed to design a processor before deliver it to the market. So the companies don't need to hire a new one to finished the job, which is really inefficient. Second, opt extension if approved will definitely attract more extremely talented students from all around world, who contribute through research, innovation, and the provision of knowledge and skills that help maintain and grow increasingly important sectors of the U.S. However, without the opt extension, I believe most student will choose university in other country that provide more opportunities for work after graduation. What a loss for USA. Last but not least, opt extension is never a bad thing for USA citizens. Companies make their decision of hiring based on talent and sills rather than anything else. Competition is everywhere and it is competition that makes the country moving forward. The companies need the best employee no matter what the race and home country is. So OPT EXTENSION PROPOSAL is a GREAT THING for the United States.
