I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons:
1. OPT students need practically using the knowledge in Industry.
2. Students normally find OPT jobs in those that Company can't find enough suitable U.S. citizens.
3. Those Industry normally need time and money to help and teach a newly employee to work properly. 1 year OPT is too short for industry, also for STEM student.
