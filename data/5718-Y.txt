Panpan Li I strongly SUPPORT the new rules for OPT extension:

1. The government should let the students possessing the relative knowledge keep making contribution to the US economy.

2. The US society should maintain its diversity. Many experts were international students before they found something important. Without OPT extension, the world could loss a lot of inventions and big discoveries.

3. The competition between US citizens and foreign students is beneficial for US development. Most of companies turn into international students because they can not find a suitable candidate from US citizens. They key for developing economy is having a open policy and let immigrants working without concerns of being pushing away.
