Someone, please tell me why the Obama administration is more interested in rewarding foreign workers than helping highly educated American Citizens find jobs with hi tech companies.

Employers wanting to hire foreign workers should be taxed 20% "foreign worker tax" and the employee should also be taxed 20% for the honor of being permitted to work in the United States at the expense of American Citizens, American Workers, and American Taxpayers.

Stop the madness. Expel all illegal aliens and reduce the number of legal foreign workers and let's give our own citizens a chance at the life they deserve.
