Those students will not likely to compete for the work that is previously done by native Americans. Most students, are majoring in Engineering. For me as an example, I major in Computer Science.

If these Asian students have no chance to work in US tech companies, there will be much fewer works eligible to work for the top tech companies. This will be a big disaster for the US economy.
