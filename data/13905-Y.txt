I absolutely, definitely, strongly SUPPORT this advisable, win-win proposal.
American can be the lead nation in this planet results from the innovation, competition. Those students are survived in the great universities, they are talents who can create profits and develop technologies for this great country. 
Those who think this extension rule might jeopardize their career future should try to equip themselves with competence and skills instead of complain the world
American need moving forward! American need COMPETITION!
