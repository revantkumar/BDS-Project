I would like to support DHS for its proposal of 24-months OPT extension from the old 17 months. Extending the OPT period for F-1 Nonimmingrant Students with STEM Degrees will not only increase the worldwide attraction of international students to the universities here in United States but also it will have an added advantage of skilled labor in the country.
