I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.

The strongest voice against OPT extension is international student will take the job positions that supposed belong to US citizens, I personally against this opinion for the following reasons:

First of all, the international students didn't take their Jobs, based on my experience before, the employer in United States are fair enough to recruit anyone with same background, we can even say they are more tend to employ native citizen because the company don't need to pay large amount of sponsor fees and don't need to afraid they can't serve for long time bases. The U.S. citizens will be more preferred to be hired when all the candidates are same qualified.

Secondly, Diversity is very important for the US, and probably one of the most important reasons why US has been so much success in the past 50 years. The United states now rely on its basic research power and service professionals, all of these fields have many many researchers coming from China, India and many parts of the world.

Thirdly, F1 is not the only way can let international student coming and work in US, there are many types of visas J, H, based on I know 75% of my classmates just going back to China after they graduated, in here, we paid for tuitions, and learned knowledge and skills, these part has nothing to do with taken anyone's job in US, I didn't see any of the Points that ONLY STUDENT TOOK AMERICANS JOBS.

THANKS FOR CONSIDERING ABOVE.
