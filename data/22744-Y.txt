I am a PhD degree holder from Stanford University currently working at Google on F1 OPT. The immigration rule is so broken that many extremely talented people like me may be forced to leave this country (I didn't get an H1B visa because I lost in the lottery process). Unless the US fixes it's broken immigration laws, many talented immigrants including myself will be forced to eventually leave this country. I welcome the move to extend the F1 opt visa extension from 17 months to 24 months as one of many required moves to keep the talent in the US and make the lives of us immigrants easier.
