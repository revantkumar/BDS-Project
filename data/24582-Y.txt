The most important reason for me decided coming to America to pursue my master degree is America has OPT (and OPT Extension) which can help gathering experience. Three years' experience can provide me a better job than one year when I going back to my home town. That's the most attractive part. If the OPT no longer exist, I'd rather choosing countries like UK and Canada which are actively instituting new strategies to attract international students.
