Without OPT extension, all the international students can only work for 12 months for the US companies.It will be a great defect for the US economy. Since most of the advanced technology companies hire employees who are international. If those people only work for one year, it cannot make up the time and money that the companies used to train the new employees if they cannot work for a longer time. So I strongly support the OPT extension policy that can allow international students to work longer.
