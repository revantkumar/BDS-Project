I strongly support this proposal. Some people may hold the opinion that STEM graduates could work on the one-year OPT after graduation. But the fact is new hires will need at least 6 to 8-month training before they could get to know the work process of the company and make contributions. If they will have to leave right after they are ready to work more efficiently and effectively, companies would not even hire them at the beginning. The 24-month extension would definitely solve this problem, and it provides an excellent opportunity for both the employees to get more familar with the work and the employer to know more about the employee, it gives the employers more time to evauate the employee in order to make decisions on whether sponsoring the employee or not. Thus, this action will largely decrease the risk for both sides of employment.
