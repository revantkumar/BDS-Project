I support. Currently, in most STEM majors, few Ph.D. students are American citizens. If the government cut the companies from recruiting internationals, they have to meet huge trouble finding qualified people for a high specified knowledge required job. Also, without competition, American young people may become more reluctant in challenging jobs. The developing speed of America will slow down.
