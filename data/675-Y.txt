Without a doubt, skilled immigrants have made a lot of contributions to America in terms of innovation and technology. But education in America is no small cost to many international students. 
One important reason they come here is that their education investments are rewarded in the job market, which in turn helps the economy grow. Canceling OPT Extension is surely going to discourage them doing so.
With a 24 month extension on the OPT, I believe this group of skilled immigrants will be better motivated and eventually everybody in the society will benefit as a result.
