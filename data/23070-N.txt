I'm not a very political man but even I can see that this plan is a travesty to all Americans! For my children not to have an equal right to employment versus a foreign applicant would have America's founding fathers upset at what this government has become! Americans are sustaining this country and should be considered priority over the foreign applicants. How many Americans are qualified to work this position versus the foreign applicants that must learn our language and be trained, while not paying taxes? 
This has to be one of the American government's worst flaws.......to help foreigners before helping our own people!
