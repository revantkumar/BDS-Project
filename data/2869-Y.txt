The OPT STEM extension students are a major force for a great amount of companies and losing them is no doubt a big hit. And losing them due to working permit is simply absurd. The extension part of F-1 student eligibility to work brings actual contribution from these students, who were fresh out of college and literally spending their first year, the orginal OPT, trying to adapt industry environment and learning curve. Once these fresh employees learned the way to actually do their jobs, they will make themselves useful to the company. Otherwise literally companies are hiring apprentices who will unlikely stay. It is a waste of time and energy from employers. The new 24-month extension sounds reasonable. It is a right amount of time to make the most out of the period between employers and employees and they can have the most benefit from each other.
