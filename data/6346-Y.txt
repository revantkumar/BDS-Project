I strongly support this rule.

1. United States is the world center with openness and equality. All talented International students are eager to apply their knowledge to practice and contribute in their study field. 

2. US economy will grow better because of Internationals students' innovation and great efforts.

3. Extending OPT will allow companies which have international students have a more stable company structure. Companies won't lose a talented hardworking employee because of the limitation of OPT.
