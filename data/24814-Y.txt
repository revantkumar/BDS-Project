I support this proposed rule. The United States has been the leader in science and technology in the world for decades, and such leadership is mainly due to the fact that the best students all over the world are attracted by the higher educational system here. These students from all over the world, together with many native talents here, make the United States the center of academia of the world. The higher educational system here is considered as one of the best across the world, not only because of the ranking and reputation of the universities, but also because of the OPT program. Especially for the recent years, while many universities at European and Asian get higher and higher ranking and reputation, the OPT program here becomes an even more important factor in attracting the best students from all over the world. As international students, we weigh the opportunity to apply the knowledge as important as the opportunity to get a better education. After all, the knowledge is meaningless to us if it cannot be contributed to the society. On the other hand, we feel indebted since many of us are receiving the assistantship or fellowship from the federal/state funding, and the extension of OPT program provides us an opportunity to make more contribution back to the society.
