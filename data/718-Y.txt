I strongly SUPPORT improving and expanding training opportunities for nonimmigrant students for the following reasons:
1. A lot of the students who can benefit from this rule have advanced technology degrees, like Masters or PhDs. These students can apply their expertise to a lot of advanced technology industry in the US, thus greatly speeding up the improvement of the technology of US.
2. Making nonimmigrant students work for the US is actually creating more job opportunities for US citizens, since nonimmigrant students can bring the advancement of technologies with their expertise in high-tech, which will result in more positions being created for US citizens.
3. If these highly talented students are forced to work for other countries because of the immigration rules, that will benefit the advancement of another economy, which might be the competitor of the US.
