I STRONGLY SUPPORT the proposal. 

I am currently an STEM student pursuing a master degree in the US. Frankly speaking, I would never consider coming here if there was not an opt extension. Since the graduate programs here are very short, many of which are only 10-month long, it is extremely hard for students to make a real leap during such a short time. Thus, the true attraction of studying here is to gain international work experience. Without an opt extention policy, many students would believe it hopeless to find a job and would consequently not come to the US to study. And international students will become fewer and fewer, whose tuitions compose a significant part of university revenues.
