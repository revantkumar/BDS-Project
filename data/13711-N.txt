Please explain how this rule change is going to improve the job prospects of American Citizens looking for work.

Given these facts:
1. OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013.

2. OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.

3. OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.

This ruling needs to be canceled or rescinded.

I want to know why the American Citizen is being denied these opportunity to benefit Foreign workers.
