I SUPPORT OPT extension:
First After I graduated, I worked for the company in the Seattle. Every year our company make large wealth for this country and I make contribution to the development of this country.
Second, freedom and democracy is the main reason I WANT to work and study in this country. Diversity culture is a great motivation for the development of country.
Third, I don't think it's a bad thing I take the position which "should be" for the American students. Competition is a reasonable for the society. If all ones just want to get the job without enough efforts, I don't think this country has a better future.
