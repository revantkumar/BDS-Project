The OPT extension policy states that "DHS continues to believe that practical training is frequently a key element of F-1 students' educational experience, and that STEM students in particular may benefit from an extended period of time in practical training." I highly agree with this statement. I have seen negative impact of this in our lab. 

In our lab, a post-doc left before completing her project as she has used up her OPT practical training time. Now, a PhD student is taking on her work. But sometimes, he is not sure about the conditions of the experiment that the post-doc carried out. So, he needs to send email to her to ask. This is very inefficient. It is uncertain how long it will take for post-doc to reply. This is just one thing that makes the project lag behind. Both professors and the PhD students are worried if this project is till worth pursuing.

Doing projects is one of the most common way of practical training for STEM students. The projects usually takes at least one year and sometimes takes two to three years to complete. For example, in our lab which is biomedical focused, a average project length is two year. I just start working on one project now, but I'll graduate in December. If there is no OPT extension, I'm unable to complete my project before I will be forced to return home. Someone will need to take my work to finish the project. But this requires much more extra time for the person to know what exactly I am doing. It takes time, sometimes several month for a person to master using an experimental equipment. It is also unreasonable to abandon the project, as the expenses put into the project has been a lot.
