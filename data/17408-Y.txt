I find many people mentioning that hiring foreigners is a method for big companies to cut down cost. But most foreign employees here nowadays are in high-tech area where the salary is not that low or even very high among all the careers comparing with like 50 or 60 years ago while most foreigners worked on building roads, running restaurant and they really took low salary so that they took job opportunities away from citizens. Time is different now. What I want to say is that those people who are complaining about foreigners taking jobs away from citizens, you should know foreign workers fight harder than you expected and then they can possibly get a job that you can also get. America is a dream country, isn't it? Everyone has the opportunity to achieve their dreams as long as they are willing to sacrifice and contribute. Now, only outstanding foreign workers can stay in America, that's already harder than most citizens to find a job. You only see the foreigners staying here but you never see the people who have to leave when their visa expires. How is the situation of you guys? Even you don't work you can still stay here. Foreigners are no longer cheap labors. That why only STEM majors can have the chance to extend their OPT. They are doing the things that only excellent people can do. No one stops you from studying STEM and get a good job. Don't blame others because of your laziness.
