I strongly support the changes made to the current OPT Extension program.

I believe that the current H1-B selection system needs revision too. International STEM field students benefit US economy and diversity. It would be even better if the lottery on H1-B would be waived as there are some students that need to leave the country if they are not lucky enough to win the H1-B lottery which they can participate twice while on OPT and OPT Extension. 

We are giving away 50000 Green cards through lottery to people from all over the world every year that may not benefit USA but we in some situations let go of the students with master and PhD degrees in science and technology because they can't win the H1-B lottery.
