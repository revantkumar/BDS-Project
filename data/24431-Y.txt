I strongly support the OPT STEM Extension. First, the United States is an immigration country, it is our tradition to welcome every talented people from around the world. Second, many high-tech companies in Silicon Valley experience shortage of candidates with high skills, OPT STEM Extension will give more chance to let high-tech companies solve this issue. Third, many STEM students are studying and working hard. High-tech is the most dynamic and active field as the newest technology is updated once every few months, many high-tech students and employees should always update their knowledge to keep them competitive, so they deserve the chance to practice their skills after graduation.
