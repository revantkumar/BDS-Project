Fuduo Ma I strongly agree on improving and expanding the OPT for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM degrees. The reason why United States can rank the No.1 developed country in the world largely contributes to the good talents introduction plan. In the history of United States, the international talents, especially the ones with STEM degrees play irreplaceable roles in the development of the country. For examples, the famous scientists Albert Einstein, Chen-Ning Yang, Enrico Fermi, etc, are all international talents. To keep the strengths and advantage of United States, more international talents are extremely needed. It is a good idea for the government to keep the high standard graduates with STEM degrees working for the United States. If the government does not expand the opt for international graduates, the international students probably will leave the United States after graduation. That means the United States spend a lot of money on educating the good international students and force them to go back and build their own countries instead of the United States. This is a tremendous loss for the United States and a big win for other countries. The United States will be soon caught up by many other countries in future if this happened. Therefore, to develop the technology, to keep the strength of United States, we need to keep international graduates by improving the OPT rule.
