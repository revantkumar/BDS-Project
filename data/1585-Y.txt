Pamela Moore I have the pleasure of working with many people here on visas from all over the world. It the IT Market, it is the norm. 
We all benefit from the collaboration and perspectives of the many cultures and experiences. The sad truth is that as a hiring manager, it is often more difficult to find a qualified American for these technical jobs. The schools have reported a major decline in American's attending college for IT related fields. I would support this extension.
