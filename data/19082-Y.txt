I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

US has come to where it is because of the substantial contribution from foreign immigrants in the past. For this reason, there needs to be a mechanism to give the F-1 students the time and opportunity to gain experience and contribute their training and education to the US research, education, economy and etc. 

Most of the STEM F-1 students are highly skilled and specialized in their respective area. They mostly take jobs most americans wouldn't take or are qualified for. So giving F1 STEM students extensions wouldn't hurt american's job security. 

OPT extension, the the OPT thing and having so many foreign F-1 students exist because there is a shortage of specialized workers in US. Many high tech companies are in great need of these students to work and contribute to the US economy. 

F1 students also enriches the diversity of the working force, which is what US is known for.
