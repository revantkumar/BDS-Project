I support expanding the OPT program for students with a STEM degree. American need these hardworking brilliant young people and they also need time and chance to bring they talent into play and fulfill their ambition in the USA. 36 months OPT program would make them calm down and try to focus on their own job. This would also benefit American businesses.
