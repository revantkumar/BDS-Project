My family and I totally oppose the ICEB Proposed Rule:Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students.

This Proposed rule would undermine the Social Security System, the Medicare System, and the ability of US students to get jobs for which they are just as qualified as the foreigners. This proposed rule is not in the best interest of our nation or our young people. Why enact a rule that hurts our own citizens? 

STOP THE ICEB Proposed Rule NOW and help our nation to put our own citizens to work.

SHAME ON OBAMA and all those involved in such corrupt ideas!!!
