Koch Davis I support this proposal:

Our immigration policy encourages us to hire US citizens unless none are available to fulfill the roles we need to fill. In other words, we do not have a preference for hiring foreign nationals over US citizens, we simply cannot find enough qualified US citizens with the necessary skills to fuel our company's growth.
