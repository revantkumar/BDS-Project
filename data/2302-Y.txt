I totally support this rule to extend the STEM OPT extension from 17 months to 24 months due to the following reasons.

1)Around 900,000 international students studied in US colleges and universities during the 2013-14 school year which contributed almost $27 billion dollars to the U.S. economy. If this rule is not passed the number of students coming to study in U.S. will drastically decline and will be a great loss to the U.S. economy

2)Also the jobs for which STEM students apply for are available for every one U.S. nationals as well as International students. So its a fair opportunity for every one. On the other hand there are many jobs for which only U.S. nationals can apply, so this gives them more opportunities over STEM students.

3)There is currently a shortage of people with degree in STEM fields in U.S.. If this rule is not passed most of the international students would have to go back to their respective country. and U.S. might have to outsource the work the other countries.

Thus to avoid a big impact on U.S. economy and for the betterment of the STEM students I support this rule.
