I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I am an international mathematics Ph.D. student from China. Before coming to the US, I was a undergraduate student at the top university of China. Many of my classmates were the best students in China. As far as I know, most of them chose to purse their master/Phd degrees in the US (other than UK, Japan or Canada, which also have top universities). The reason for this is quite simple: the US provides better industry opportunity during school or after graduation. OPT extension is a very important part because it offers the international students opportunities to work in the US for more than 12 months before getting H1B. Because of this policy, many top students from all over the world will come to the US. These students contributes their intelligence to the US before going back to their home country. If the OPT extension policy is terminated for some reason, it will be a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies and top US universities.
