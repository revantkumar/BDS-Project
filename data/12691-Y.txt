I strongly support the the approval of this new OPT program.

From the comments, I realized many people don't understand how difficult it is for an international student to find a decent job in US and even got the opportunity to work as OPT student. If you are an international student, whenever you go to a career fair, 90% of the companies will not talk to you once they know you are not US citizen, since they cannot sponsor H1b and they don't want to have an OPT student, trained him/her for 1 or 2 years and let him/her go. Also, US citizens are borne with advantages in networking, communication, culture and resources. If there are two candidates with same qualities, the US citizen will always take the priority. From what I have seen, on average, an international student needs to send out more than 100 applications nationwide to get 2-3 interview opportunities. Moreover, there are many limitations to benefits from OPT program. The job has to be major related, you must be working more than 40 hours a week, you cannot have no job more than cumulatively up to 90 days during the whole OPT period. Many international student tried so hard but still could't meet the restrictions, and went back their home countries eventually. Those who finally stayed are no doubt the most talented people.

If there is no gap in STEM positions, no company will hire international students. The point that OPT students are taking jobs away from US citizens is invalid. And considering the people who got to stayed are the most outstanding ones, I think it is very smart to provide them more time to work in US and help growing the economy.
