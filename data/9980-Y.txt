Who don't like us stay and work in US?
* Local STEM major students? or IT company employee?
Answer is WHO believe we get the job from their hands. But this OPT is only a time for student who want to learn more from company, OPT is not a way to work.

And why?
*Because they had dream to work at high tech company, but they don't have the ability to handle the job. Like I had a classmate, he had graduated from Canada college, and continue the master degree in bay area, He want to get a offer from Google or Facebook, but he never get one. He is a Green Card holder. I don't want to show how he get the Green Card by a XXX way. He always said "If all the CS student go back China, he will get the offer, and married a Chinese girl..."

So?
* America is a Great country. We all have the America Dream. Just gave the students 3 year time to learn more.
