Lewis Lu I'm a international student on OPT status working in amazon. Nowadays a lot of international students as me works in tech companies in US and contributes to the country with our special knowledge in science and are paying more than 40k tax per year. Since more and more people are going to the H1B lottery in April recent years, the original 17 month STEM seems too short for us. The old 29 month (12 month OPT+17 month Stem) allow me to do H1B lotteries twice and if neither works out I'll have to go back to my countries despite all the effort I make at work which is not fair at all. Instead, the new 24 month STEM will give us 3 H1B lottery opportunities. Personally I hope eventually H1b would be easily available for every international students work in tech companies with certain level of special knowledge without lottery. The new 24 month STEM is a good step toward that direction which I fully support.
