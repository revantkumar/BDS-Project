Science, Technology, Engineering and Math are among the disciplines that have been essential for innovation in human history. These disciplines are deeply intertwined in the real world and have significantly improved the quality of human life, especially in the last two centuries. Innovation is the driving engine for the rising of the U.S. to one of the greatest nation in history and all effort is deserved to provide opportunities for people contributing to innovation. 

Nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees have received extensive training in STEM fields and they are equipped with the skills and experiences that will enable them to contribute to the robust economy and diversity of the U.S. It would be a great loss for the U.S. to have provided high quality education to them, but deny the opportunity to have them make contributions. Therefore, I encourage the U.S. government to make policies that keep doors open for these high quality new talents. And I strongly support this rule by ICEB and look forward to its approval.
