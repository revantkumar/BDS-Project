From the other comments it seems that the American believed their supreme position in technology are all contributed by their natural citizens. I really doubt that how long will the technology advance maintain if American companies try to reject all the technology immigrantsAnd believing driving all stem students away will create more work opportunities for natural American is also ridicularsit is an obvious result that the technology companies will turn to start subsidiary in other countries to reduce cost. And that does not increase the job opportunities for American citizen. And the companies that cannot reduce cost through this will suffer from financial burden or even go bankruptwhich is actually reducing the job opportunities. The key to increase job opportunities is to keep the competence of companies but not to stop others getting employed . I believe countries in europe and asia will really like to see American drive all the well trained engineer back to their countries and make their companies more competitive.
