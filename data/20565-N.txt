My concern is that Department of Homeland Security is requesting to make changes to the Optional Practical Training program without Congress consent & approval to expand a program that already takes jobs away from US Citizens and gives those jobs to foreign citizens at our expense. Changing the time for one year to three years does not help American citizens get jobs but does allow foreign citizens to take those jobs. This is just more corporate welfare at our expense.The need should be to expand so that jobs are for American Citizens first, then and only if there are no American Citizens available for these jobs then open to foreign citizens. If we keep expanding the foreign citizens working pool then wages will continue to be depressed. All employees working in The United States should have Social Security and Medicare taxes withheld from their pay and matching by the company paid into Social Security & Medicare. If the foreign citizen returns home then the Social Security & Medicare remains in the US to help fund those programs. Why should We The People give a company a free ride at our expense. By doing so the pockets of the greedy business owners expand and We The People have to suffer the expense.
