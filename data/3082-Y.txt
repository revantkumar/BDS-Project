I think we need an extension.
Firstly, this extension will attract more students in other countries to go to America to study. As we all known, the tuition is really a lot of money and a big resource of financing for a school, which will result in more taxes. More taxes means that America has more money to build the charming country and make it a better place for people to live.
Secondly, lots of students just want to have some work experience in America before they go back to their homeland, which is better for them to hunt a job in their homeland. In fact , they do not care about immigrating to America and all they want is the work experience in America. Therefore , an extension can satisfy their needs and 3 years work experiences in America is long enough for them to hunt a great job in their homeland. They prefer to come back their homeland after the extension, because their purpose is already reached. As the situation around me , lots of my friends prefer to go back to their homeland rather than immigrating. After all, homeland is the root.
