I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..
2. My international classmates were all hardworking and smart and it would be great for them to work here and we can learn from each other during the work.
3. It is very important to absorb more elites in all over the world by letting them have the opportunity to work and become as a resident here.
