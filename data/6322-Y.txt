Lorreina Hao I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international computer science master student from China. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my master degree in US, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and British. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation.
Without the OPT extension rule, international students can only work for a company for less than a year. However, most company would't hire people who can only work for one year. It's a waste of money and time because new employee spend a lot of time getting used to the company and go through all training process. Thus, without the OPT extension rule, foreign students will have nearly no woking opportunities in US. 
Since many of the students who are now under OPT extension works in high-tech industry, if this rule is prevented, I believe the high-tech industry in US will been though a huge disaster for losing talents.
