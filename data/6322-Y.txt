I strongly support this proposal as the nature of EDUCATION is not factory manufacturing a product, once it finished the last step then throw it out to the market. Education should be a continuous and seamlessly process to help the students learning knowledge and skills and applying their knowledge and skills to the society, namely, in to their career and professional fields. In most companies, 3 years is a minimum requirement to train their employee from a fresh grad to a experienced employee (or entry level employee). We need to give those student a chance to be trained enough till they are on the track of career, not toddling and be able to run by themselves.
