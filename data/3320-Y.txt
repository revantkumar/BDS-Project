zhao wu, University at Buffalo Strongly support the proposal:
Reason 1. United States is well known in its education and education really makes huge profit for the whole country. Rejecting the proposal will cause huge decrease in the number of international students thus do harm to education industry.
Reason 2. United States is known for its diversity. Students from different countries over the world devote themselves contributing to the development of U.S., especially in those area that requires professional training. We are making this country richer as US citizens. 
Reason 3. Competition does exist, but that's a good thing for United States. International students are mostly hired by hi-tech companies. We are weak in English, we are weak in social relationship. We are not competing by taking low salary, so I would say, the only reason that any company would hire international students is because they can't find suitable US citizens to fit in their job. Competition might harm those who are not good at their professional skills, but if one domestic student and one international student has similar level of skills then its to see who the company would prefer. Overall, competition will benefit whole U.S. by increasing the average skills of everyone, which will make US economy keep growing.
Reason 4. We can say that United States is the most powerful country in the world. What makes it strong? Because it's open to professionals all over the world. Those who strongly reject this are afraid competition would do harm to themselves despite the fact that competition would actually be a good thing for the whole country.
