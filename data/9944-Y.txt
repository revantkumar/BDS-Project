Aravind Subramoney I fully support the new change of increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months instead of the current 17 months. This increased duration of practical training will help students utilize their education to the maximum extent and this will make education in the US all the more powerful and effective. I believe this will have a direct impact on the quality of work/products produced by companies in the US.
