I strongly support this action. Many US companies hire significant amount of international students as employees. These international students contribute much to US economy. If they cannot get OPT extension, they cannot serve those companies in one year. This will not only create big loss for international students themselves, but most importantly it will have great negative impact for US companies and US economy.
