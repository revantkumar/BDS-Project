This benefits only companies hiring foreign workers and is another disaster for citizens looking for jobs. With this program, our own citizens don't even get the benefit of additional free training afforded to foreigners. And why; since they are supposed to be college graduates, do they even need more training? 

We all know this is another example of replacing our American workers with cheaper foreign labor. Employers who hire these people will not even be contributing to social security or medicare, nor will the workers. This saves companies billions of dollars and is the reason big business is lobbying for and promoting this program. This is another reason social security and medicare is underfunded. In addition, companies pay lower wages to these foreign visa holders, so they save money on every level--and the American citizen is getting the shaft.

At this rate, it won't be long before every employee is replaced with a foreign worker. We've already seen that happening. Disney recently had their American workers train their foreign replacements.

This is just another example of people like Zuckerburg manipulating politics and policies to become incredibly more rich. It's past time to start protecting American workers from the foreign infiltration which is usurping their jobs. People like him will not be satisfied until there is no longer a middle class.
