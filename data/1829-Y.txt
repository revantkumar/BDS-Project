I think this is a good move and will serve the country well. I would like for the list of what is considered STEM to be modified allowing for additional STEM majors to be added. New fields are emerging on college campuses and may not fall under older, well established fields.

I would like for the appropriate party to consider adding a Master of Science in Construction Management as a STEM field.
