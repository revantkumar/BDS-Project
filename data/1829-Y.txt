Anonymous Compared with the universe, our planet is more trivial than a pale blue dot. Interestingly, we have over 200 countries existing on this place, building boundaries to guard the welfare of their own citizens without realizing that being together makes us stronger than being divided. 

From what we learned in history, an open, inclusive organization always lives longer and develops faster than those that are sealed and exclusive. U.S. is now the most influential county in the world, part of the reason is that it has been a place where each individual is able to achieve his/her dreams as long as they are willing to work hard and make a positive difference, regardless of their ethnicity, gender, or whatever makes him/her different from others. I believe we all born equal but what we can bring to this world may differ from each other. You may play a role of a foreign student, hoping to grasp the knowledge that our civilization has developed and possibly to take it a little bit further; You may also play a role of a policy maker, dedicated to gather opinions and hope to bring the maximum benefit to your country and people. We all have our roles, but the important thing is to realize the role we are playing not only impact ourselves, but the future generations. We are shaping the direction of the history and therefore our actions matter! 

That said, I want to make my impact here: I am advocating the 24-month OPT extension for the eligible F-1 students. I hope we can be far-sighted to make a more open, inclusive and equal society to breed more thoughts, ideas, advancements in technologies, and finally more welfare to our people. Our grand grand grand children will be proud of the RIGHT policies we set now. 

Cheers for the better future!
