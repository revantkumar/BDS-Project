I strongly support the proposal due to several reasons:

First, by providing F-1 students with sufficient amount of time to work legally within the U.S. upon graduation, students can make great contributions to the economic development of U.S.

Second, this policy will foster a diversified environment in U.S. labor market, which is of vital importance in making innovative discoveries or breakthroughs in nearly every field. 

Third, while this policy will inevitably boost the competition between native American and international students, such competition is nevertheless a good thing in that it will help the society pick the most prominent people, which will exert far-reaching impact on the long term development of economy.
