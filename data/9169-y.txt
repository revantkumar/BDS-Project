Jason Wang I strongly support OPT extension program. It plays an important role in keeping the most talented international students in USA. 

USCIS states that F-1 students engaging in post-completion OPT are eligible for a 17-month STEM extension even if they have not yet completed the thesis requirement or equivalent for their STEM degree.Please make this point clearly in the new rule. 

However,SEVIS systems states "pier to recommending a 17-month extension for OPT, you must ensure the student earned a STEM designated bachelors, masters, or doctorate degree". Please see the attachment for details. Please update the change in the SEVIS system to avoid confusion.
