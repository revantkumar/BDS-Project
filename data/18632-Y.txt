Strongly support the proposed extension since it is a requirement to boost American economy, retain talent pool, remain competitive in the global market. The extension will remove the uncertainties faced by both the employer and the Students with just the initial 12-month OPT program.

Also would like to request DHS to kindly include "Masters of Information Systems Management(MISM) - CIP code 52.1201" into the STEM list because it is the most sought after degree by many IT companies if you look at their job requirements.

Would like to re-iterate that MISM course topics cover wide range of Information Technology (IT) areas that are already inclusive in the current STEM list as per the following - system analysis/analyst principles(11.0501); process and data flow analysis.(11.0501); systems planning ; human interfacing and user analysis (11.0401); aspects of operating systems and networks (11.0201); network systems and management; network and flow optimization (11.0901); data modeling/Warehousing and administration (11.0802); database theory (11.0802); data flow analysis and design (11.0501); Computer Systems Networking and Telecommunications(11.0901); Networking, and LAN/WAN Management/Manager(11.1002); IT project Management (11.1005); security needs of computers and network systems (11.1003); designing security systems (11.0802).

I have also done a Major in Wireless communications that covered radio(pure science on radio waves) and mobile technology.
MISM is a composite of the above STEM topics hence it will be highly beneficial if included as STEM. Kindly request DHS to please revise the STEM list within the timeframe of this rule making.
