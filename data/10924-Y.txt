In the second place, these stem students do not take over local citizens working opportunities at all. So far as we know, U.S. is the NO.1 high technical developing country, and its demands of high technical people are much larger than those that local citizens could provide. In this case, stem students fulfill this gap perfectly. I cannot imagine what kind of people are against this proposed rule which is obviously a win-win rule. Some of these people are not even stem-related. They cannot find jobs due to their own reasons. For example, they do not study hard and work hard. They pay less but want more. I learned a lesson in a class that people blamed others to let themselves feel good when they failed. So these losers blamed other innocent and diligent people. Their only motivation is that if I do not feel good, I will never let you feel good.
