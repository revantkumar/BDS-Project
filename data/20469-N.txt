I believe the Program should be returned to its original intention of allowing those from other countries into our nation
on the bases that they desire education at one of our schools not somehow give them special status and a back door around
normal immigration. It seems this is how our laws get so complex byapplying so many band aids to the law. If it needs to be
changed do it the right way.
