Shenru Li I stand for STEM extension. I saw many negative comments are focus on the of possibility decrease of local workers working on STEM positions. Actually in my opinion, if the number of H1 holders which is for longer time working permission is limited then the influence on local employment is not as much as it seems to be.

On the other hand, unlike H1, STEM is with F1, which can bring more rich and spoiled Chinese students to the States and they will spend large amount of money here. We all know that consumption can bring back prosperity and employment, especially after the crisis. This is a win-win game, not a zero-sum game.

From my own emotional perspective, I came from China but I really love life in New York. This feeling is so strong that I would give up everything in my hometown and leave my parents and friends to come here. I consider this kind of emotion as my American Dream. I believe that, as the ethos of this nation, the American Dream is deeply rooted in the heart of everyone. And I also believe that if STEM can continue to work, it will help more people to fulfill their American Dreams, not only foreigners, but also local people who are beneficial from the prosperity. STEM extension is not a simple issue that can be measured only by employment rates or some other numbers. This is related to the spirit of the whole country, why it is so attractive, so young and energetic. We should not sacrifice this because of short-sighted ideas.
