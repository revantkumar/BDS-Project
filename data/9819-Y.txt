STEM majors are driving forces of technologies and researches. US has great institutions that attract students from all over the world to come and receive quality education. Providing opt opportunity to foreign students not only enable students with more opportunity to further their skills, but also keep US at the frontier of science and technology and remain the center for research and educational resources. STEM majors are usually hard and are studied by lots of foreign students, while US students like to pursue large variaties of fields like theater, business, design etc. Providing longer STEM opt won't harm the employment in these fields, and for US stem students, they have lot more advantages than average foreign STEM students in terms of language, cultural fit, status requirement, personal connections etc. So I would say, offering opt opportunities would only help retain top talents, and as far as I see, US students never face as hard of a challenge to find employment as those on opt status do.
