I support this rule. It is obvious that former opt extension issued in 2008 had a very positive effect on U.S. employment market. The unemployment rate is keeping decreasing since 2008 and the industry need more and more employees during these years. So it is nonsense that U.S. STEM students could not find jobs. Because U.S. colleges expand admission for international students, the U.S. economy recovers quickly and many high tech companies came out which provide lots of job positions. We have to admit that OPT STEM students play the important roles in these companies. Rather then saying OPT STEM students take jobs away from U.S. students, we should notice that OPT STEM students create a lot more job positions. If this rule gets approved, definitely it will continue benefiting U.S. economy and providing more job opportunities.
