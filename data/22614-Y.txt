I support to firm the policy of F1 non-immigration STEM students' OPT extension. A 24 months extension means too much for us. For our international students, there are many difficulties when stepping into job marketing. We've spent lots of money and precious years on studies but still limit in campus. We really need time to launch ourselves and prove ourselves in a different society. Any government' s determination even a little bit change of certain rules will affects our future. Please think about that on the side of thousands upon thousands overseas students! Thank you very much!
