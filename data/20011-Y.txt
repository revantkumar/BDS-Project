Seems this policy change gives foreign students or other foreign persons an advantage over US citizens in the workplace and does not lookout for US citizens looking for employment in STEM related fields. The notion of many US legal citizens is that the US government is bending over backward to help foreigners get jobs and training. I would say no to this policy change and suggest DHS focus on ensuring our country is strong and safe, because I do not believe it is at this time.
