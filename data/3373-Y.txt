I strongly support the approval of the improving and expanding of OPT for F1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. My reasons are:

1. Those students paid the tuition to get educated in the STEM programs, so it is reasonable to provide them with training opportunities. Whether they will pass the training period and be kept on the position in companies should depend on their ability as well as the needs of companies rather than the policy. If citizens are more competitive and suitable to those positions, the opportunities won't let them go. Therefore, I do not see any contradictions of offering opt to those f1 students. If this is the case, then the length of training, 1 year, 2 years or 3 years won't make much difference. Then why not offering them more time to practice what USA has educated and make contributions to the country?

2. If people think the extension of opt length will be bad to the citizens in terms of job opportunities, I can only think of this as blaming personal uncompetitiveness on the policy. On one hand, schools expand and make more money on enrolling international students to the STEM programs. While on the other hand, the states do not offer those students enough training opportunities. Does this sound ridiculous? If the country do not want those international students to work here, why not shrinking the enrollment of STEM programs? Don't let the current ones disappointed.
