I am strongly opposed to the proposed expansion of the optional practical training (OPT) program. This is another way for companies to hire cheap foreign labor at the expense of American workers. I was directly impacted by programs such as this. I have two degrees in mathematics and had a career of software development. Then I was forced into early retirement after having been laid off twice. Please do not let this happen to other American workers. Thank you.
