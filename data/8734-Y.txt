Be wise and think about it, If there is no chance for international students to work in America for few years, study aboard will be less worthy for them. Think about How much money International students spend in U.S. , think about how they improve the economy in U.S., and think about how they can do the work better than native people. It is important for USA to keep these people rather than push them away which just want to keep job for Americans. If international students all leave, there will be less job for American and some American still cannot get an job! All in all, don't just focus on the benefit in front of your eyes, thinking in a wider way!
