From Albert Einstein to C.N.Yang, from John von Neumann to Sergey Brin, spirit of inclusion and opportunity for all makes America stronger and stronger. May be next Einstein, next Neumann comes from those F-1 students, which overcoming lots of difficulties to study at America. It is a win-win situation to let them work for America. On the other hand, what if those elites come back to their motherlands to help their own nations become better with what they have learned in America? 
It is not good right? 

So what really concerns is to make sure that those people coming to America are real elites at their area rather than whether OPT should be expanded. 

May be "strict entry and tolerant exit" is a good idea.
