I strongly support this proposal.
I work in an IT company in California. Based on what I have seen in our company, most OPT and H1B holders are well-educated, qualified employees. They receive the same salary as American employees at the same level. They have gone through the same hiring process. They have to reach the same bar to get a certain position in our company. Therefore, I believe OPT will not give any advantage to foreign students over native students. OPT just provides a way such that foreign students have the opportunity to be treated equally as American students, only within one or two years. Some of them who did not get H1B have to leave after that. It is a huge loss to our company! We spend a huge amount of time and effort to train them into experienced, excellent employees, but they still have to leave. I believe we are not the only company facing this problem.
