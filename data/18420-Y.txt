COME ON, WHY WE STILL HAVE SO MANY RACISTS IN USA?????

As a citizen, I totally agree with this policy. I don't even know why we have so many people complaint that the international students take the job from them. As far as I know, in engineering industry, every company has pretty fair hiring process to hire people, not matter international student or domestic student. If our PROUD USA students have better knowledge and techniques, there is no doubt that we will hire domestic student. 

Actually we must admit that there is language problem in international students, so as a matter of face, I'm more willing to hire domestic students over international students. BUT, OUR GOOD USE STUDENTS DO NOT LIKE STEM MAJOR!!! They prefer to be a lawyer or a doctor, I don't understand why people complain about international students took the job they don't like.

I strongly advise our students stop complaining and open the text books in your bedroom, beat international students in their ass by better knowledge. NOT JUST BLAMING ON THEM!!!!!!
