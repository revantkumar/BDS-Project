as an international student, I know that some of those STEM students may have considered the opportunities offered by the STEM opt extension when deciding whether to pursue their degree in the US. and now if this rule is suddenly cancelled, it will be a big impact to those students and also I think the attraction of US higher education will also become less competitive to other countries... For US high education organization, it will be a big lose for them from finance perspectives and also I think without attracting enough international students, the higher education in US will become less and less competitive globally.
