The OPT 24-months extension is in favor of companies, especially those in high-tech industries, to acquire talents to fill the currently existing gap in headcount shortage in short and medium term projects or assignments. The OPT extension does not necessarily cause a direct competition between STEM international students and U.S. citizens. 

In a long term perspective, the OPT extension provides companies looking for suitable candidates for permanent positions a valuable opportunity to train, screen and consider a candidate for sponsorship, which is helpful to those companies in need of high profile talents.
