I strongly support this proposed rule since this is a win-win strategy for both US and international students who attained or is going to attain STEM degree in US. For one thing, most US companies rely on international students to create values for their companies and bring more vibrant ideas, which bring more revenue and then be converted to tax for IRS. And this tax would benefit each US citizens here. For international students here, after graduate from school, this is a good opportunity to apply what they learned in class and gain more real-world industry and these experiences are helpful when they back in home country. 

After reviewing so many negative comments who object the proposed rule. I found something they have in common: they are really afraid that US citizens will lose their jobs in all the industries.
I don't think they have to worry about this at all. First, the proposed rule only benefits international employees who attained their STEM degree in US. And OPT extension only allows them to work in tech industry. Working in any other industry will be illegal and they will get deported if they get caught. Second, US tech companies definitely prefer US citizens over international students if they have the same skill set and capability because they can work here without any restrictions whereas international students need sponsor from those tech companies. Third, for my situation, the rental fees are a part of incomes to the US citizen who has an unused house. 

In Conclusion, the duration of an extension would be set at 24 months, rather than limited to a shorter period, due to the complexity and typical durations of research, development, testing, and other projects commonly undertaken in STEM fields. Also, it benefit and stimulate the economy of US.
