I believe OPT-extension if NECESSARY for our country.
Over the years, Students in the pursuit of self-worth while creating a large number of productivity and GDP for our country.If canceled OPT program, first, our country will lose its appeal to global students, the education industry will suffer a lot, more than 80% of all graduate students are international. Second, when we loss all these talented students, and only depends on the creativity of local people, there is no doubt that it will be difficult to maintain our status as a global leader in science and technology. Last but not least,our country from the beginning is a nation of immigrants, it is from the world's talented people build up, and canceling OPT is inconsistent with our founding philosophy.
