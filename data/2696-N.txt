The Obama administration's proposal to expand the Optional Practical Training program is an attempt to drive tech wages down by supplying 100,000 cheap workers per year outside the H1B program. As Michael Teitelbaum pointed out at the UC Davis Provost's forum on 9 October, 2014, the claim that there is a STEM worker shortage is simply propaganda --disseminated by a well funded tech industry and accepted by ill-informed media and politicians. OPT program expansion is just another way to keep STEM wages low and guarantee that American graduates in STEM fields will continue to have difficulty finding jobs while companies thrive on cheap foreign labor. The program should not be allowed.
