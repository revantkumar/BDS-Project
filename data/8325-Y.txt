I strongly agree to pass the rule as it could benefit US citizen rather than cutting jobs.
people complain about the FICA tax, which is not actually the case, anyone who stay at US long enough needs to pay, at least I know every foreign PHD student needs to pay when close to their graduation.
removed the highly educated people do not equal to more jobs for US, consulting companies transfers more and more people to US who do not pass US education and just come and took the job, that is actually the main reason real F1 student will need extension.
under this condition, student who is not lucky enough could not get the right to work, that is why we need more times to increase their chance to stay. Without them, you will never have Youtube, Nvidia, etc. So give them a chance, give US a chance.
Thank you.
