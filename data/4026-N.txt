I don't know what I can do at my age to help get rid of the greatest threat to the United States except to comment. But here goes. In my 87 yrs, I have never seen a greater threat than our traitorous president. Why don't the republicans start an impeachment against him, makes me think our whole government are traitors. He has done more damage to us people than all other presidents combined.Now we have a speaker of the house as bad as he is. Thousands of people out of jobs and prices going up so my retirement will not put food on the table anymore. I am not getting a cost of living increase to compensate because he said there is no inflation. Where does he shop for groceries? Our prices have gone up by at least 30% since he has become president. Of course he don't care as some one else shops for him with our
money.
