OPT is an important factor why most of the foreign students choose to study in US in the first place. And yes it provides an training program and thus beneficial for F-1 students. But why just ignoring all the economics boosting brought by foreign students?
And US citizens are just complaining about the extension because the cannot find a job? Is that really the reason why some citizens cannot find a job? I receive many emails from my school everyday posting openings and available scholarships, 99% of which requires an citizenship. And even with this over-protective environment, US citizens still think F-1 students affect largely with their job seeking. Why not just work harder and face up the competition. Stop whining.
