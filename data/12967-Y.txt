Four years ago, I decided to study abroad in the United States since I realized I can learn more professional skills about computer science. Right now, I only have one more semester to graduate. I love here, it is the only reason I want to work at here. I am not sure if I want to go back to my hometown in the future. But I am pretty sure I want to give my contribution to here, United States. However, the H1B lottery is very competitive. More and more international students with strong skills cannot continue their job just because of the problem of status. In this situation, the OPT extension is another way to solve the problem. I think almost every owner of high tech company in silicon valley cannot say that they do not need international students. The contribution of international students are very huge for this country in last 10 to 20 years. I do not think the students work in a company with OPT extension will not influence American Citizen a lot. On the other hand, if this policy is cancelled in the future, I am sure a bunch of high tech company will lose a lot of potential high quality employee from other country. OPT extension policy is not only for us, but also for the companies in the United States. Please do consider my recommendations.
Generally speakingI highly support OPT to be extended.
