Natalie Kuo Strongly advocate the proposal of OPT extension.
Based on the Federal Register/Vol.80,No.201 "...Safeguards for U.S Workers in related field.To guard against adverse effects on U.S WORKERS. THIS Proposal would require terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity to be commensurate with those applicable to similarly situated U.S. workers...2)the employer will not terminate ,lay off or furlough any full or part-time, temporary or permanent U.S workers as a result of proving the STEM OPT to the students".
Therefore this OPT extension can effectively protect the benefits of the U.S citizens, but also give international students better opportunity to provide their skills for the U.S development.
