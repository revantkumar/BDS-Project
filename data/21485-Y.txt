i stand for American workers! and the young American students who want to find work! I am against the overreach of the president - again! The original intent of this program was to help students from other countries gain an education - and then GO BACK to their countries to help the economy there! The students who receive this help should SIGN an agreement that they WILL return to their own countries. We should be restricting the program - not expanding it.
