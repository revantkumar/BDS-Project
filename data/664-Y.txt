Yes I support this rule. Most of the foreign students come here to get some good experience, 1 year of work in opt is very short period for that and even USA will benefit from foreign intellectuals if they work here. USA has a big market and opportunities compared to other countries that is why people come here. Even there is lot of incoming from other countries USA have enough job opportunities for both citizens and non citizens. So I support this rule and I hope it will be implemented so that students who come here with better hopes about their future will really have some future.
