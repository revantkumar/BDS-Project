Perhaps we should think of the American students and workers first, rather than trying to allow this proposed rule to be enacted. I was an engineering student quite a few years ago and after graduation I was offered a job overseas I had to go through a vetting process and was then placed onto a list of potential employees for this company. I had a ninety day waiting period during which time the company was required to make any and every effort to hire a citizen of that country before I could be employed by them. Guess what? I never did get a chance to work there because they filled the position with a citizen of that country. The United States should follow the same rules and regulations for foreign nationals as the most stringent of the other countries with whom we deal. We also should not be giving foreign nationals student loans, scholarships, student work programs or any other educational assistance until all other U. S. candidates have been taken care of 100%. Do not allow this proposed rule to become enacted!
