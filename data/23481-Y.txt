I am a newly employed Quantitative Analyst working for Keybank in Cleveland area. As I know, most of the banks are hiring international students, who are majoring in STEM, in risk management area, which is a very important department for banks, especially after financial crisis. Unfortunately, only half of the international employees could receive working visa every year in our bank. So it is truly necessary to extend OPT to keep these valuable employees in U.S.
