Mei Deng I support this ruling as US needs a lot of STEM degree professionals in the near future. As an IT professional consultant I see the need for STEM workers everyday. The offshore model does not work well for us so a lot of IT jobs are coming back to US. This rule is critical to retain the talent from our universities and graduate schools, so that we can fill in the need for the work force.
