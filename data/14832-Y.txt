Our country has been waiting for this rule for so many years. The recession and arrest of development has been seen by everyone in this country. We need more power, we need more talents! We have accepted a great amount of non-legal immigrants each year. Why don't we save a little more talents from other country? We train them and ask them to leave. It does not make any sense to me. In another hand, it's for STEM major only, not all majors. Those are most important for the development of technol and economy of our country. There is no reason to give up this rule. If you are American, you should support this rule!! Let's make this work! Highly support this rule!
