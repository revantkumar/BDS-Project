I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Foreign students study in US universities, then they should stay and work in US to apply their knowledge and make contributions. 
2. America is an immigrant country. Great people are great not because they are US citizens but because they do great.
3. There is no bad competition in job market between US and foreign students. Some positions don't have good enough US job candidates, but foreign students can be better choice.
