I totally agree extending OPT for 24 month. I believe this is a win win option for US government, US companies, educational system as well as international student and their country.

It is beneficial for US government to do it because it wins a world wide support for the government. Cancelling it may disappoint the international students, their parents and their home country in desire for highly experience and qualified students to construct their home country. 

It also drake away the opportunity for the vast amount of us companies to add some intelligent, global blood to them.

Having access to practical train is so important for learning really skills and knowledge that if students know there will not be such an opportunity, it may decrease their willing to come to US. Thus, it can harm the education system in US.

It is all the students' right to practice what they have learnt in school to the most appropriate environment after they graduate from school. For all the US student the US is definitely the best place. Even they don't want to stay at American for citizenship, they all desire the opportunity to test the knowledge learnt in school at US market. And they shall be ensure that right.

Besides, the country send their student to US for learning and training will not want students coming back home from US with no experience. It will really hard for any local company to hire them if they have no working experience but a degree for another country.
