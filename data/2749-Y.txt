Yuanyi Zhang This is good for the US. This policy will bring more international students into the states, which will benefit the US economy and enrich the diversity on campus. This will also bring more money to colleges and universities, providing better service for domestic and international students.

This won't increase immigrants since it is limited by the 80,000 H1B quota every year. This won't decrease domestic people's employment rate either. According to the statistic of the US Department of Education, US is great need of STEM employees. This policy, aimmed at STEM students, will therefore actually offer US what it needs.

All in all, this policy is good for the US. We should embrace this policy.
