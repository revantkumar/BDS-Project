I highly support the new extension of OPT. Foreign students have contributed a lot to this conountry. In 2013-14, they made net worth of $26.8 to the American society. And claiming hiring foreign students will harm the domestic workers is nonsense. Usually, some of those international students will start their own companies which offer more jobs as a whole. Over the long run, the extension of OPT will only do good to our country and I don't get it why some of those people hate it. We love smart people to love for our country, we love our country to be better, and we need those elites! I support this!
