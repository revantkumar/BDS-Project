I am a big fan of OPT extension. I have lived in Pittsburgh for over 15 years.My restaurant serves a lot of international students from U Pitt and CMU everyday. I am afraid my restaurant and some other restaurants in this area have to be closed, if OPT extension is shut down. There must be fewer international students without OPT extension. Not only me, but also my 5 american employees will lost their jobs. 

So I believe similar problems will happen to a lot of restaurants or other shops which are replied on students. And as a result it will have damage to US economy too.
