Monali Mishra This is an excellent proposal and helps many students who come for higher education, to understand their industry and global trends through practical work experience in US. 
But as I read through the proposed rule one thing in particular stands out to me. I see that the mentoring and training plan is required for OPT extension. The reason that strikes me as odd is - anyone applying for OPT extension has already used up 12 months of practical training and is only then allowed to apply for extension. This means that the student has been working for at least 6 months (if we consider the 120 days requirement for applying for extension). Generally an employee will rarely undergo more than 6 months training and mentoring. So asking for a mentoring plan which will be applicable when the student has already been working for 12 months when the extension becomes valid, does not seem a practical plan.
A student at the beginning of his/her career would benefit more from a plan rather than mid-way.
