I am an international student currently studying in the US. I strongly SUPPORT the proposal and am going to discuss it from a personal perspective.

The existence of OPT and its extension for STEM major is one of the key reasons that I decided to come to US to pursue my higher education. Since the skills trained at university in different countries are by no means identical, usually it is hard for students studying in US to get immediate recognition from employers in their home country. The OPT extension ensures the STEM students to have the opportunity of getting their skills recognized as they step out of the campus and put these skills into productivity at industry. Many people, including me, will be very disappointed if this country rejects us of the chance to practice our skills in a best suited place, just because it poses threat to the high skill job market. Without the OPT, many people will choose not to come to US and it will be a significant loss to the technology development in US. Just from my personal experience, the field of Computer Science is a place where a considerable amount of workforce are formed up by international students. Losing these students is almost equivalent to loosing that amount of knowledge and development.
