I actively support this new OPT extension rule. I paid much more expensive tuition to study in U.S. and I want to be more competitive when I come back to my home country to seeking for a job. 12 months is not enough, on one hand no one can ensure to find a job as soon as graduation, on the other hand, one year to to short to master enough skill in industry field. If U.S. abuse this opt extension, the U.S. education field will loss its global competition.
