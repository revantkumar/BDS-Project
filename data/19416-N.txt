I oppose the DHS proposed rule to expand the OPT program to 3 years. The OPT program is already an end-run around limits on H-1 B visas and an OPT expansion to 3 years will further destroy the job prospects of American STEM graduates.
Once their schooling is complete, graduates are professionals with Bachelor's and Master's degrees in the STEM fields, what is the justification for mentoring them here in the U.S. after graduation? They should be fully equipped to go back and accept jobs in their own countries.
