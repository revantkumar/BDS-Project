This is a good policy definitely for both US and foreign students. USA is an immigrant country, whose strong economics and science largely depend on talents from all around the world. For those citizens who are opposed to STEM, they are just selfish and lazy. As a matter of fact, all of my American classmates get a job immediately after they graduate, much more easily than foreign students. American companies are actually more willing to hire citizens. They hire foreign people just because there are no enough citizens to fill up their openings. So STEM is the only way to get enough and qualified employers for those companies.
