Jenny Hicks I am a tech worker, working with competitive foreign graduates. I don't see it as a bad thing. Most of them are bright and can provide fresh ideas. Our recruiting team seems welcoming domestic students as well as foreign students.
In a word, I fully support this rule. I believe keeping OPT STEM students will help company development.
