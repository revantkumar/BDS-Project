Jie Zhang I'm a master student major in Engineering and currently working with OPT Extension. In my mind, OPT extension is a great way not only for graduated STEM international students gaining working experience in USA and involving USA style work environment, but also benefiting the USA economic, especially in STEM fields. Because of OPT and OPT Extension, a lot of outstanding students from all over the world are willing to come to USA, finishing their degree and seeking job and work opportunities, which will dramatically decorate the USA educational environment, accelerate the economy, technology, science, engineering and management development.

As for myself, through OPT Extension I am able to put what I have learned into the real work, trouble shooting problems and bring more value to the company.

As for employers, because of the OPT Extension, they are able to find the very right candidates from STEM students to join their team, bringing fresh ideas to the company, bringing fresh blood to this fast-stepped century.
