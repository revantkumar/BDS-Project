I cannot support this bill. Why do we keep focusing so much time and effort on helping foreigners and immigrants get jobs when there's millions of qualified American citizens that need jobs? The government is doing us a major disservice by continually ignoring the majority who elected them and pays their salaries. I personally wouldn't be opposed to filing a class action lawsuit against the government for negligence and dereliction of duty.
