As a software developer for at least 25 years, it is appalling that other workers will be allowed into this country to take jobs away from Americans. And even if jobs are not taken away, it will bring wages down. There is already competition from those outside the country be outsourcing software development to other countries (I don't oppose this, per se). However, to bring those people to this country is not good for the country in the long run.
