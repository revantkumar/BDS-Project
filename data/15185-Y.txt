Saket Ati People come to the United States of America with a passion to pursue the "American Dream"! For centuries, the United States of America has been a pot that accumulates a diversity of cultures from around the world. People dream of coming to the United States of America to fulfill their dreams of freedom and liberty! This country is looked up to for it's welcoming nature. As one of the first members in my family to pursue a higher education degree in the United States, I take great pride in talking about the exciting opportunities that this country has to provide. 
On the other hand, an international student pursuing a higher education here, has to endure the stress that comes with filling out multiple forms at every step of the way. Even students with opportunities striking their way need to jump through so many different rules and regulations in order to work. Now add to that the fact that they only have one shot at winning a H1-B visa. Even the thought of having to leave everything in my life and go back brings me chills. Students like me that have parents in this country, have been studying in this country for 4-6 years, have formed deep relationships with people around them will be absolutely devastated to know that they have to leave everything at some point and start a new life. The OPT STEM extension has been a blessing for students like me that have their entire life in this country. These immigrant workers are enhancing the technology we live in by leaps and bounds. They are creating jobs in fields that didn't exist just a decade ago. They are contributing to the economic development of this country. Please pass the regulation to extend the OPT STEM extension period! This helps keep families together and relationships strong.
