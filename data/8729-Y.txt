I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. Expanding of OPT can give the chances that let the students who learned and graduated from the U.S. universities keep making contributions to the U.S. There are so many stories in the history that prove immigrants made grate contributions to the U.S.
2. Expanding of OPT will never affect the job opportunities of citizens in the U.S, because citizens always have priority to obtain the jobs and this situation will never change even though OPT would have been expanded. In fact, currently the jobs obtained by the International students who graduated from universities in the U.S. are those the citizens would not like to do.
3. Obviously, competition does exist in any time whether OPT would have been expended or not. However, it goes without saying that competition is not a bad thing. On the contrary, it is good for the health of market, and can efficiently promote both enterprises and normal people in the country.
