The perversely named 'Department of Homeland Security' (sic), an agency which REFUSES to secure the borders of the USA, has upped it's own perversity.

DHS has a proposed a rule to EXPAND the deceitfully-named 'Optional Practical Training' program aka MORE corporate welfare. 

Instead of providing real jobs in high paying industries for young Americans coming out of American colleges, the Obama Administration's goal is to make that almost impossible for young US Citizen grads.

The blatant example of this "Deeds Done for Deep-Pocketed but Not Patriotic Donors Act" INCREASES -- TRIPLES!-- the term any ALIEN student may work in the USA from 12 months to 36 months!

OSUE ('Obama Suck-Up Employers') thus both DEPRESS wages & DITCH paying their share of payroll taxes. 

Foreign workers win. American would-be workers LOSE! 

Benjamin Franklin opined that "He that waits on fortune is never sure of a dinner." 

If OPT is approved in all its perversity, as requested, DHS seeks to ensure that hundreds to thousands of willing, talented, young Americans will suffer the sour stomachs of joblessness, while watching an alien pocket the wages he or she SHOULD have been earning.

Act for sanity and fairness. Allow the OPT for Americans, only, who will, we hope, make their lives and thus SECURE their futures and our own in America.
