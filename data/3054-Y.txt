Derek Tyvarg. How is STEM OPT better than citizens at finding jobs? Can you provide ANY sources that STEM OPT jobs pay less than citizens? The citizens have lots of safe buffers when it comes to jobs. First of all, most small-to-mid-sized companies do not hire international students right away because they lack the attorney power to deal with USCIS procedures. When it comes to big companies, they hire based on MERITS. If you cannot get a job at large corporations, maybe work a little bit more on your merits first before complaining international students come taking your job? Secondly, immigration of elites is what make America leader in technology. If there aren't a lot of great immigrants bringing cutting edge science and technology, where would investment go? Probably Europe and Asia, where jobs will be created. Thirdly, STEM OPT is simply a way to citizenship for F1 students, if you take that away, there will be less students coming to America and contribute. Which sounds good to you short sighted people until companies start outsourcing to look for more talent outside, SHIPPING MORE JOBS OVERSEA. 
Please use your judgement more judiciously and don't give in to the fear mongering propaganda.
