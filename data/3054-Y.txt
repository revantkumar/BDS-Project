I support the proposal but I think a few more control mechanisms are needed for this to be successful. 

The first thing I noticed was that DHS has a no control over the supply of OPT students. The number of OPTs applied is controlled by the number of international students accepted by accredited universities. It can vary largely based on the economic interests of the universities recruiting. So, the number of OPTs is directly related to the economic interest of universities. DHS should control the number of international students a college can recruit/ control the number of OPTs they can issue.

The second control that I would like DHS to consider is to control the number of OPTs issued based on economy. If US economy were to go into a recession and STEM employers decide to cut jobs, DHS should stop take steps to prevent employers from hiring OPTs before the people who were let go. DHS should consider adding an automatic stop to issuing OPTs when unemployment in STEM fields goes above 5%, or some level that DHS seems appropriate, is recommended.

With pro-growth policies that have controls to handle the unexpected, I am confident OPTs can benefit the US economy.
