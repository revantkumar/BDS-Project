Josie Dickinson This is a disgrace. There are already too many foreign IT workers in this country. Americans are being fired and replaced with these Indians and Chinese. Who does the government work for? It certainly is out of touch with the citizens. There is absolutely no need for these foreigners. The same companies that hire them in droves such as Microsoft, layoff Americans at the same time.
Our immigration policies are horrible.
