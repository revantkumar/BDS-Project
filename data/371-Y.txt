I strongly support the extension for STEM students. 

As a graduate student who majors in engineering, I have been receiving rigorous training from universities in both US for more than 5 years. With all of the technical knowledge I have obtained, I feel obliged to contribute to the society after graduation. With the STEM extension, I will be able to work longer in the US during my most energetic age, and contribute my talent to this society. 

In addition, most of the engineering projects we have been working on require years of continuous work from the research staff. As graduate students, our familiarity with the academic knowledge and technical skills are very likely to speed up the research progress and improve the quality of outcomes. 

Last but not least, US is a country that respects diversification more than any other countries all over the world. Talents from different cultural backgrounds can get inspirations from each other very easily via sufficient communication and collaboration, which is exactly the case I have been enjoying throughout study and work experience in the US. Therefore, such diversification in the society will be a win-win strategy for both local and foreign people from a long run perspective.
