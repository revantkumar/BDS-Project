Hello DHS, This is a very good initiative in extending the OPT period to 27 months. The 36 months extension could have been more better and given foreign students came to United States to pursue their Master's program in the field of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. I read about the mentor program, where the manager of the company has to take the whole responsibility of his employee. This is additional burden to the manager and also additional paper work should be done. So there are lot of risk factors behind this program that a manager should go through, therefore he might give less preference in fact no preference to foreign students. I do not agree with the mentoring program rule which consists of the manger responsible for his employee. Please change the rule with the 27 months or if possible 36 months extension, but without the mentoring program.
