I support the STEM OPT extension, and I think that a reasonable person who understands what it is will support it.

Foreign STEM students are valuable human capital to the economy and national strength. They only constitute a small portion of the workforce, but make significant contribution to technological innovations. They are diligent, intelligent, and well trained for sophisticated jobs. They will not only reduce the job opportunities of citizens, but actually create more for them. The STEM OPT extension allows these students to continue their training in the respected fields, while also give them the opportunity to make these contributions.

Without this extension, foreign STEM students will likely to leave with their skills and experiences, because of uncertainties and hurdles in working visa, etc. This will significantly weaken the innovation strength of the nation and the companies, while boost the competitors' capability.

In this global and fast changing world, every capable nation/company is trying hard to attract smart minds from the world. Only stupids will block the "brain flow".
