Asuka Gatou The new rule is great. The opt extension itself is actually win-win for US and international students. Frankly speaking, one-year practice is too short for students to apply what they have learned into practice. The OPT extension lets students have enough time to continue to take efforts and make great contribution to the company. Besides, the engineering field need thousands of students' help to have breakthrough. The reason why US becomes the strongest country in this world maybe its amazing human resources. The talents from all over the world migrating to US maybe the reason. The revocation of the extension would largely decrease the amount of foreign students, and make less and less international students in university. This is not what we want to see. Also, the opt extension only benefits students majoring in STEM and only applies on E-verify company. Actually it would not do harm to the American students when they want to find a job.
