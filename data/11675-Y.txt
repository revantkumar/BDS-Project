I strongly support the proposed rule of improving and expanding the OPT period for F1 students. Increasing the total OPT period from 29 month to 36 months does not mean that the domestic students and the local job seekers would be at a disadvantage. The extension would only help to provide a healthy competitive environment that the domestic residents must be willing to face. Demanding for systems that would benefit the lesser driven and diligent community does not help the country one bit and this would impair the progress of the US and limit it from achieving greater heights. The government on the other hand should ensure that it is a level playing field for both the F1 and the non F1 job seekers by taxing the companies at the same rate irrespective of whether the candidate is a local or an international (F1).
