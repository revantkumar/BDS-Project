Yes, I support immigrant students remaining in the US long after they've earned their degrees. Immigrant students have more than proven that they come to America to make not only their lives better but that of their families and America. Whether America acknowledges their contributions to a society that lacks and pleads for intelligent college educated individuals , America HAS to admit that an immigrant's contribution is what will keep America in the forefront of Nations that can and will make America greater.
