Once again, our federal government focuses on ignoring qualified struggling U.S. citizens seeking technical jobs, by proposing to expand the Optional Practical Training program. Such a proposal only incentivize U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students. How can they pass up hiring a foreign student for up to three years knowing they can avoid paying their share of payroll taxes? Keep in mind, it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. Please consider my opposition to this proposal for the sake of raising the participation rate of employment for U.S. citizens qualified, but struggling to recoup from the great recession our administration say we are no longer in.
