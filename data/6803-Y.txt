Xiaoting Bi If US wants to keep attracting foreign students to come to study in America, it is not wise to cancel or shorten OPT extension. Without this OPT extension, foreign students may choose to study in Europe, Japan and other countries, because the tuition is lower and they provide better job opportunities after graduation. 

Students with STEM degrees need more time to work in American companies to be skilled in their areas. So that they can perform better when they go back to their country. As this OPT opportunity only give several years to foreign students, it won't be a threat to American job seekers. And many foreign students are genius and deligent, so they can make contributions to their companies and United States society.

Also, many students come to America because of OPT extension and many students are in their OPT stage now, if the OPT extension is cancelled, it seems to be cheating to those students, and what should those students that are in OPT extension stage do? It is dishonest to all foreign students, whoever are studying now, whoever graduated, or whoever are planning to come to US.

And what's worse, it will harm American economy. For example, many technical companies in Sillycon Valley hire large numbers of foreign students. And there are not enough native American learning computer science. Without those foreign students, many companies won't have enough employees and will decrease the speed of development. Eventually, American economy will be impeded.
