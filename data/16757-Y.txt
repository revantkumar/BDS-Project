I strongly supported for this proposal, because it will benefit students and US government, and also American people in a long term.
You need to see this in a logical way,because they are connected with each other. If without foreign students' "support", maybe most college will suffer a low-budget period for a long time and it shall be the same for the education level.
In the mean time, the losing of tax shall also cause much more troubles for US government.
Now it is a time for globalization, we need to work together for "Double Winners", rather than just care about your own short-time benefit.
