Before became a university staff and got green card, I was also an international student. Now I understand why universities need international students at such an urgent extent. Even though we could argue that many private colleges admitted international for profits, how about public schools? Now almost every public university meets with tremendous financial pressure. However, the out-of-state tuition paid by international students really made contribution to improve the awful financial situation of universities. And many international students who have a career success later also made donation to the universities funds. Moreover, they also drive the development of the local economy. Many apartments was built to accommodate them and earn rental fees, many restaurants have a better business than ever before. 

But if we cancel the OPT extension proposal, I think in the near future the international students would suffer a substantial reduction and that situation certainly will have a negative impact to public universities and local economy. And this cancellation would also let those people who previous were international students but now were American citizens have deep doubts of American dreams. I wonder how many of those who are against immigrants coming to US are first generation Americans
