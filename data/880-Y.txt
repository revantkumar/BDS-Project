I strongly support this proposed rule for following reasons.

Firstly, it can attract more international student to apply for American university, which can bring a lot of economic benefit, not only for university but also for the city, for every Americans. Not mention more tuition, more international student means we need more facilities such as gym, restaurant which can increase job opportunities .

Secondly, someone against proposed rule says that government should leave jobs for locals. But has he thought about the outcome of this protection of American students? The protection will lead to less competition, resulting in less hard working of American students. Let's learn lessons from history. China, a powerful country in Tang dynasty, closed its gate of country , causing China to fall behind the whole world.

Lastly, the international student who can find a job must be talented and competitive. Why don't we use these guys to build a better and more developed country? America should keep attracting these person with high IQ , which is the reason why the USA is the most developed country all over the world.
