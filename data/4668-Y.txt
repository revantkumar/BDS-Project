I totally support the new STEM extension rule.

First, OPT Students also paid all the university fees without any funding from University or Government or from teaching assistantships, as any other US Citizens and OPT students are not getting any Social Security Benefits and nothing is free in this country to OPT students and Medical trust funds and please note not to deviate the fact that there is $0 for Social Security for OPT students and they are contributing to US economy by paying TAX to Govt.
With the new 24 months STEM extension, students will contribute to the growth of US Economy by paying the Taxes on their employment ( 3 Years x $3000 per year x 400000 students= Total $ 3600000000.00). Total Benefit to US Economy Benefit in the range of $ 83600000000 for 5 years.

Besides, I know a data from website, more and more students have started to go to ENGLAND because of they think OPT extension may be stopped by the court in US and there in England the education is less expensive for Masters, since it is one year only and lot of employment opportunities. However, this change will make America loser for each Masters seat evolving around $125000 per year as college fees. If there are no students for Masters STEM, there will be a loss of $ 31250000000 per year to USA with 250000 proposed foreign students. Total Loss to US Colleges and Universities in 10 year will be $312500000000!
I think we should know is that most of the students paid University non resident tuition and other fees to US Government at a very high rate and if this OPT extension is not there, IT IS A GUARANTEE THAT NO FOREIGN STUDENT WILL COME TO STUDY IN US. They are not ready to study only bookish knowledge which can be got in their countries and through online itself.

If we cancel OPT and its STEM extension, more STEM students will just leave US after graduation, this will be a huge lose for current company in STEM area. Since current in US universities, international student is the majority to
