I support the proposal.when people say that international students have made American workers out of job, thats not true. Competition does exist, but it will allow American students to be more competitive. On the other hand, these international students in the future will very likely become American permanent residents or citizens.They will become a part of American family. Now, we can have both American elite students and international eite students to make contribution to America together. Furthermore, international students will consume. This no doubt will increase job for some people.
