Kaiqiang Zhang I support this proposal that STEM students ' opt should be extended. Because America need more talented elites in STEM field, if cancelling this proposal, America will lose many excellent employees in STEM field. In the same way, We didn't steal American local residents' job, because hiring a employee is fair in any American company, International students didn't have any privilege, however they need more efforts to get the job. At last I hope this proposal can be passed. I support homeland security department's decision to extend STEM students' OPT.
