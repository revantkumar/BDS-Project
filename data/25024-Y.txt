Strongly support: ppl please DON'T get confused with illegal immigrants and STEM international students who are well trained by the US education system (some are even leading experts in the most cutting-edge tech field). Simply block these intellectual resources out of the states and force them to go to other countries (mostly Asia, Europe) could not solve solve any employment problem but only hurt US in the long run. The interwoven tapestry that defines the United States as a land of opportunity is represented in the diversity of thoughts and ideas brought by good people from all over the world.
