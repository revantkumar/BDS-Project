I strongly support the new rule!

I would like to ask a question to the people against the rule:

What wrong have we done?
Have you ever thought of the reason why we live here, far away from the family members that love us dearly? Dont we miss them? The primary reason to this question would be that we love what we do. We love the fields that we have chosen and want to leave a mark on the world so that it can evolve and grow and technology can be made available to all. We dont get anything for easy. We go through a rigorous interview process which mind you is open for all and the only reason we get the job is because the employers think we can do a better job than any other applicant. Have we ever stopped you from applying to the same job positions? If you are capable enough, I am sure you will get the job before all of us. As for the tax money, we pay approximately 28% of our income as taxes here in California. So it is not that we dont make contribution to the Government's funds.

People migrate here because there are numerous opportunities to grow as a professional and not having this rule takes away from all that. As International students we pay thrice the fees as an instate student pays. Most of us take loans back home and need to repay the debt with high income rates. 

I am not sure if there would be enough qualified people to fill the void left by the employees who are on OPT.
An opportunity is made available for all and is independent of any discrimination and it goes to the person who deserves it the most. Dont take our opportunity by not passing this rule.
