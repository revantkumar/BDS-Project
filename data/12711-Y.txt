I strongly support this rule for improving and expanding opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees, simply because U.S needs more hight talented and educated engineer, employer, scientist, and researcher to boost current U.S economy. Besides, long OPT training will attract more talented students to study in U.S, which will benefit current U.S educational system.
