The Department of Homeland Security is proposing the expansion of the OPT program for foreign students. At the least this is counter productive for American workers because of the following:

OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.

This expansion must not take place.
