I believe F-1 students are the chosen good students that can have better competent both in school and at work. They passed different kinds of exams to be enrolled in good universities, and now they want to have the chance to apply what they have learned to the work. They need time to make the companies better. Also, the OPT extension can attract more good students to work here, and ultimately it can improve the overall economy.
