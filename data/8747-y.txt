Jingqi Zhou I think this is a proper proposal that benefits both American economy and international F-1 students. American STEM industry needs OPT students to make up for the lack of proficient employees. And F-1 students value the working experiences during OPT. One guy from Intel once visited our lab and said that they always gave priority to US citizens when hiring new employees because some sensitive projects should only be accessed by US citizens. However, they found it difficult to hire enough suitable US citizens for all positions. Thus, F-1 employees with OPT occupy an important portion in their company. The contributions from OPT employees improve the prosperity of American economy. Therefore, F-1 students with OPT dont lead to the unemployment of US citizens. I am aware that some people who oppose the proposal argue that employers are more likely to hire OPT employees because they can pay less salaries to them. This is not the case in STEM industry. My alumnus are usually hired for high-level positions in their OPT jobs. Their salaries are well above the average middle class income level. Requirements for STEM positions usually include solid foundation in classes, stringent working style, and good ability in learning new stuffs. Thus, employers care more about whether the candidates fit the positions rather than how much they need to pay. Therefore, STEM OPT extension is a proposal that helpful for all of us, rather than harming the interests of US citizens.
