Just think about how many international students are there in the STEM major. We take up a big chunk of the total class, not to mention the grads school. Who's gonna fill up the need for those positions? FYI In some of the grad in my school, there are only 2 domestic students. Is US gonna hire some random people who are not even qualified for STEM jobs? Or hire people from overseas to fill up the needs? Either way, I think giving international an extension on H1B will be a better solution.
