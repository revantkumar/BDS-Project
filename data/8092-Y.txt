Sanjay Patel To whom it may concern,

I fully support the proposed rule of OPT extension for 24 months. It would be beneficial for the newly graduates from around the world to be able to enhance their knowledge and gain real life work experience. Thanks for providing me with a chance to voice my opinion. 

Thanks,
Sanjay Patel
