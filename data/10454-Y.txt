I do support the Rule for the following reasons:

1. Science, technology,engineering and math (STEM) related industries like manufacturing, finance, professional services, and trading are great contributors (around 55%) to the US GDP. Needless to say the comparative advantage in STEM human resources help the US to maintain its world leading position. Not only do the industries that are related with STEM, but also the maintaining the US leading position in the world require a lot of hard working employees and researchers. Highly educated immigrants are great work force while few/ A few citizens are willing to do those tedious works with medium payment. Extending F1 students' serving time will benefit these major GDP driver areas.

2. Great amount of grants for science and technology are spent every year. And a lot of international students benefit from it (considering the overwhelming amount of international students in STEM programs). If let those students only serve the US for one year (maybe zero years after the students seen the unwelcoming policy to international students), it is an immediate and great great loss to the US tax payers.

3. Those STEM students all experienced high education in the US. They are LEGAL TAX PAYERS and very self-disciplined. They contribute to the economy as much as, if not more, than US citizens.
