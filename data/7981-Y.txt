Allowing highly skilled STEM major international students to work in US for additional 24 months will directly benefits US economy and maintain the fast growth of US tech sector, which is crucial to maintaining the preeminent position of United States in terms of economic prosperity, knowledge discovery and innovation. The brightest and the most skilled international students around the world come to US to pursue study in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Their potential to create knowledge, technology innovation and ultimately wealth is too big to be ignored. Those students with STEM major degrees from US higher education institution are valuable human capital top US companies across industries desperately need in order to strengthen their leading positions in today's globalized economy. Abandoning the OPT extension will cause the loss of some of the most talented and educated workforce for United States, hence deeply harm US's long term competitive advantage and cause brain drain for top tech companies. Thus, I strongly support the 24 months OPT extension for international students with STEM degrees from accredited higher education institutions.
