Chong Shen An important part of the U.S. economy is the tech industry which gathers the smartest talents around the world to create the most innovative technology. A large number of these smartest talents are international students on F-1 visas from top colleges like the IVY League, MIT, CalTech, and others. This is very evident in the structure of top tech companies like Facebook, Google, Microsoft and many others. Even the leaders of these companies, such as Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO, Satya Nadella, Microsoft's CEO, are international. That just shows how good international talents are in helping U.S. tech firms compete in the global market. Why would the U.S. not want these talented international students to contribute to the U.S. tech firms and the U.S. economy?
