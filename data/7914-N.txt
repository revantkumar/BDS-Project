This is one of the most ludicrous rules/laws in history. Job availability is not any where near our own country's need, let alone making them available to foreigners, especially good, well paying jobs. This is just another one of Obama's poorly thought out plans. This country has provided the environment for company's to prosper more so than any country in the world and to now allow those companies to utilize foreign workers at the expense of American workers because of government rules is just plain ridiculous !!! Also this is the kind of rule/law that should be approved by Congress, not a presidents prerogative. DO NOT ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN.
