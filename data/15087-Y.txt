I support the policy to improve and extend OPT period for eligible international students.

Since they're basically good and hard working people with high educational degrees who are really helpful to the american society. I am an international student and I understand that my family paid a lot for my tuition in my school in the United States (way more than local US students), now I get a chance to work and communicate more with american society but I have to concern about the valid period of my Visa. In bad situations rent a short term lease apartment and the company might have problem paying their employee on time, US citizens in such situation will definitely leave the company but we still have to stay to keep our legal Visa status probably due to our spouse, to keep them in company.

In other perspectives, the highly educated population is also helping with tourism, apartment rental, all kind of business. I don't see the point hating this population.

The narrow idea of competition between different peoples is misdirecting the mind of a group of people.
