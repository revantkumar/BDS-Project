Dear Sir or Madam,

I would like to support the proposal. It really benefits me personally a lot. As a student, I am able to apply what I learnt in school to benefit the US society and help its recovery in economy, which is exciting.

Also, please ignore those negative reviews, I know that "The Washington Alliance of Technology Workers" hired people who wrote thousands of negative reviews.
