I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Every STEM student comes to the U.S. to realize their American Dream, and a longer OPT period will definitely help them realize their dream.

2. The government should encourage those students who excelled in academia to further make contribution to the U.S., such as work in the U.S..
