I would support the proposal since the reason why united states will become one of the strongest countries in the world is due to it's diversity.It has the tradition to welcome people who are willing to and able to make this country better.And it is this tradition that makes the country stronger. The international students brought their culture to united states, we should welcome them and encourage them to build a better america instead of pushing them out of our door. The spirit of america of freedom, equal and diverse should never and will never fade.
