As an international student (Currently holding OPT and working for a private-company), I am very glad that I have such a chance to express what my thoughts about this bill. First of all, personally, I believe, this is a win-win situation for both U.S economy and international student. Like for example, currently I am working for non-pay internship, providing several dynamic helps no only on their relationships but also expand their business even further to oversea, especially China mainland. Also, I believe the reason for most international students applying OPT is because we want to have a better work experiences which can helps we to have better opportunities when we back to our home-country. (Because U.S economy is the best all over the world and that is what globally believes, also China, and holding U.S internship give us a better terrace). This is totally not like the most anti-bill supporter believes. For international students, U.S are not their home and without their parents. THIS IS NOT THING RELATED TO IMMIGRATION. (And most international students very unlikely to stay, even they stay, that have very small amount. They will back to their home-country in the future, because this is not the place we belonged to) Expanding OPT is not thing related to IMMIGRATION, and even people able to stay here, that means THEY HAVE THE GREATER ABILITY THAN OTHERS (Which can provide a greater contribution to U.S) but nothing else. So, at the end, I agree this Bill to pass, standing as the third party, (even the bill pass, there is no effect for the past OPT international students)
