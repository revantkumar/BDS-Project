I fully support the new Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students rule. 

As we all know, United States has almost the most advanced and innovated technology in the world. With more STEM students' contribution, this will bring more potential to the technology field of United States.

What's more, if creating a startup in my OPT time, it will bring more job opportunities to Americans.

This new rule can show how strong and open United States is, and that is what makes United States great.
