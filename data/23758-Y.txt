I STRONGLY SUPPORT the idea of STEM extension is truly a good idea for the stable growth of large companies. It can give large companies recruit hardworking international engineering students for the positions which the number of domestic engineering students is not enough for.

OPT extension is helpful not only for the international student, but also for the american.The STEM students work hard because their families are paying a large load of money to American education institutions and IRS and Medicare center and landlords and other organizations to let them have a great learning experience in USA, and to gain great working abilities. It's not fair to say that STEM students are taking American's jobs. It's just a competitive environment and sometimes people who work like 100 hrs a week can get hired and paid.

Can you imagine, if the brilliant minds all go to other countries, will the U.S. still be the great U.S. any more? NO! The U.S. will lose the science and technology leadership to other countries, and will lose innovation, industries, and thus job opportunities to other countries. The best products will be coming out from the U.S. any more, people will not buy products and services from here, and the workers here will lose their jobs. That U.S. will no longer be the great U.S. any more! 
The OPT extension does all kinds of good to the U.S. and the people. The U.S. just cannot afford to lose it!
