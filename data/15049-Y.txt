On behalf of small high tech companies I support this OPT 24 stem extension. If this rule doesn't pass, we don't like to hire OPT students because we know 3 out of 4 will be gone next year. So what's the point to hire them? We won't have the capability to hire enough smart people we need only within Americans. 

Another thing to note is we pay the same to foreign student as US citizens. Most of good high-tech companies are equally right hiring companies.
