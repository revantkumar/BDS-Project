Ashley Alexander I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. A lot of us complaining of the competition in the job market. Actually, most of these students will work in the field required very specific skills. And these jobs are never filled up by citizens and important for our high-tech companies to be competitive at international level.
We need them stay and work for us!
