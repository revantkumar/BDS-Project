The STEM OPT program is designed to primarily benefit foreign students, corporate mega-millionaire/billionaires, and the universities. There is no benefit for American STEM students, only a miniscule benefit for current American STEM workers, and absolutely no benefit for the average American taxpayer.

Foreign students: 
-They will be better positioned for a career in their field
Note what the "Initial Regulatory Impact Analysis" document indicates: The STEM Optional Practical Training program will "ensure students gain valuable practical STEM experience that supplements knowledge gained through their academic studies. By earning a functional understanding of how to apply that knowledge in a work setting, students will be better positioned to begin careers in their fields of study." (pg. 8). 
"With respect to benefits, making the STEM OPT extension available to additional students and extending the current 17-month extension will enhance students' ability to achieve the objectives of their courses of study by gaining valuable knowledge and skills through on-the-job training that is often unavailable in their home countries." (pg. 12)
-They will get the same wages as current U.S. workers
Note the following: The proposed rule would require "compensation that is commensurate with that paid to similarly situated U.S. workers and that complies with appropriate labor laws."
-They would get a longer time to draw these wages
Note the following: "This proposed rule, if made final, would extend to 24-months the previous 17-month OPT extension program for STEM graduates; allow eligible students two STEM OPT extensions in their lifetime...."(pg. 9)
-They are not required to pay Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes.
-They will have the opportunity for permanent long-term employment with the same company or with another company since there is nothing that forbids this.

Why is DHS concerned about better positioning foreigners to begin careers in their fields
