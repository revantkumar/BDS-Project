I vehemently oppose OPT expansion proposal. 

DHS' proposed rule is pushing american students out of the job market and handing those jobs to people who have no ties to the US except for education.

- OPT was meant to help foreign students in their home countries WHEN they returned, but it has been abused and treated like a bridge for them to stay in the US and it has been abused by companies to get around H1B visa cap. DHS proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of OPT program.
Furthermore, OPT denies americans approx. 430,000 jobs per year (thanks to Freedom Of Information Act). That removed approx. $4 bln. from Social Security & Medicare trust funds. 
- There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.
- As per Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa "By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent."
- It is pure fiction that someone with a master's degree in electrical engineering needs an additional three years to work as an intern to be a productive professional. Instead, the duration seems to come out of thin air, based purely on what the political types in the Obama White House believe that they can get through without facing significant opposition.
- The worker protections included in the new rule "are so vague and deferential to employers that they will be virtually unenforceable in practice in any meaningful way.
- I worry that like other employment-visa programs, OPT works to lower the wages and living standards of a growing portion of the middle class.
