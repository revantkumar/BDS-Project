Hai Feng I support this rule.

1. The contribution which can be created by STEM student in three years is far more than three times of one-year-contribution. As we know, most of the STEM jobs rely on experience, in other words, the value can be made by STEM students is keep on growing when the STEM job experience growing. 

2. New rule can stimulate consumption. For most of the students, one year OPT program limits their consumption ability. Granted that they can earn one year salary, most of them prefer to save the money as capital of re-employment when they go back to their home country. Those employee afraid of spending money to loan a new car or buy new furniture even though they are affordable. 
But three-year program can change their consumption concept, they have better consumer opportunities. These employees will be an important part of stimulus spending.

3. More potential talented STEM students can be attracted by this new rule. They can make more value, spur more consumption in American but not other countries.
