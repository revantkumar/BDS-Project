I vigorously oppose the expansion of the Optional Practical Training program. The proposed change makes this program as beneficial to the foreign student as the H1-B visa, all the while lining the pockets of employers who don't have to pay the employer portion of the foreign worker's payroll taxes, nor even the prevailing wage. This unfairly incents the employer, while discouraging the natural-born student/worker from competing. Do not do this!
