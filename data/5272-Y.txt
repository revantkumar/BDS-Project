Yihai Zhu US has spent some many resources on educating STEM students and these students are also very important for US to keep its leadership in developing high technology. If US let these students all leave, it is not only US lose some many talents, but strongly enhance the competitors in high techs. From the US perspective, I strongly recommend keeping as many STEP students stay in US as possible.
