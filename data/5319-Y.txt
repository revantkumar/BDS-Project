nanda ilm I appreciate the governments decision to allow students to gather technical practical experience. 
If a student is allowed to enter US to study, he/she must be allowed to work enough time to enhance his knowledge and take it back to his/her respective country. That way the student benefits, the government also benefits due to tax. This is a win-win situation.
