I, as a PhD student graduted last December and now working with OPT, totally agree and welcome the new rules of improving and expanding opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. United States was built by diligent immigrants and is thriving now on the contributions of many diligent people including skilled immigrants. F-1 nonimmigrant students are among those people who are dedicated to contribute their knowledge and skill to this great country. As research indicated, many individuals majoring in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields make outsized contributions to innovation and entrepreneurship, which helps grow the nation's economy and create jobs for all Americans. Both Americans and F-1 steudents will benefit from the new rules published by the Department of Homeland Security. We are eagerly looking forward to the final rules to be approved!

Regards!
