Tian Tianzhenzi I strongly hope that this rule can be enacted.As a person who wanna study in the US, I consider the most attraction is not only the high quality of educationbut also the freedom and equality of the society. I can image that this law can benefit America a lot rather than damaging the native's rights or descending the employment of the locals.Firstmost of the foreign students are well -educated and well-informedand also they love America and want to make some differences to the society and the world which definitely will also enhance the US's economy. With the talented students, the US can develop better.Because more intelligent people are available and more amazing invention will happen and thus more fields that are unknown or undeveloped yet will boom in the future and more job opportunities will be created in the long term. So there is no worry about the risk to the nonexisted drop of the locals' employment rates. Second I think the Americans will work harder and devote themselves to their work because of the competition with intelligent foreigners. So they will not slack at work anymore and the work efficiency will be improved a lot which can benefit the companise and also make a great contribution to the GPD of the country.
AT LAST I DO WANT TO SHOW MY SUPPORT AGAIN!!!
