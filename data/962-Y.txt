I had the opportunity to read about many of the concerns that were raised by a lot of people with regards to this rule. While some of the concerns seem genuine to me - erasure of money from Social Security/Medicare etc, most of them do not make too much sense. The general undercurrent to this discussion seems to hinge on the fact that somehow American workers are more intelligent than their "foreign counterparts" - which is not only a totally ridiculous conjecture but has no data to support it as well. As far as the depleting funds in the Social Security/Medicare are concerned, please remember that a foreign national pays tax at a rate of 30% (almost 40% in California). Not sure, but last I checked, such contributions did provide the US Govt. a lot of money. 
A lot of folks seem to be under the impression that the US Govt. is spending money to educate internationals, and that somehow we do not have student loans. Let me reassure you nothing could be farther from the truth. I myself went to an IVY league school and am still trying to repay student loans.Please also remember, a foreign national does not get to enjoy any of the benefits of Social Security / Medicare once they are on a H1 visa even though they pay the ~7% tax on their paycheck . 
Having put these things in perspective I do believe that foreign nationals should be given the opportunity to at least be competitive in the job market. If the employers do not extend equal opportunity rights to native workers, then that is something to be discussed in a different forum. I support this rule wholeheartedly. 

Cheers
