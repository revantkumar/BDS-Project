The new rule is absolutely supporting the field of technology and economics in United States. I strongly agree with this 24 months OPT extension rules. It will not steal other people's job. The number of job position will be like snow ball. It will get much more when more people putting their effort on the STEM area. The contribution of a successful STEM graduate will create more jobs directly and indirectly than what we think. Technology stimulate the economic. If United States' Job field is able to absorb those competent and diligent STEM students, why not?
