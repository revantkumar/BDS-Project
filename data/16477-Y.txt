I absolutely support this new act.

I think most people who hold opinions against this are fairly short-sighted and probably not that competent. Driving the bright and smart out of this country, just to help protect the interests of some group not willing to compete in a free job market, will never help the United States. After all, we need to remember this is the land of the free and home of the brave. Not the other way around.

Thanks.
