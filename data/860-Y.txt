Pengjie Zhang What is the essence of America? A country full of power, a country full of promise, a country full of knowledge. Allover the above, "people" create the future of this country. A country like US should always be willing to assimilate more, accept more, evolve more. Young is the future, and students create the bright future. International students consist of a important part of the country, they are brilliant, creative and hard-working, they are responsible for making US more promising. So it's definitely helpful if the OPT extension is 24 months. Regards.
