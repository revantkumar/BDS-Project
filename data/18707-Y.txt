I can't think of a reason why this proposal would get disapproved. STEM OPT extension is one way to attract foreign students to study in the United States, and is also a way for United States to keep more talented and skilled workers. Foreign students not only bring in the skills and also bring in the money they have. They spend and consume, and their family will spend and consume when they visit US, which is an upside for the economy. Canceling STEM OPT extension does more harm than good.
