I STRONGLY SUPPORT this 24-month extension. Some people may complain that many unemployed US citizen should have priority of getting job opportunities. But from my personal 1-month job seeking experience, I found that all candidates were evenly treated. If you want an offer, then show them your ability, no matter you are international students or not. Companies that hiring international students definitely prove that they learned a lot from their education experience here. And its time to let them practice their skills and contribute to the U.S. economy. I cannot imagine how may companies will HAVE TROUBLES if they lose their employees who cannot work without OPT extension. 3 year is a reasonable life cycle for comprehensive projects. And I think the U.S. economy needs international students working on these projects to keep making progress.
