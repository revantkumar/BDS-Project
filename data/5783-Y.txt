I strongly support the new OPT policy. It's very good for our county. I have a lot of international students who are really smart and hard working. Bring them to working in US really benefit our industry and economy. They are who we need to build our country and maintain the dominant position internationally. Imagine all these kind of good talent goes to other country after acquiring high education from US, it's a waste of strength. We should keep them and give them chance for help building our economy.
