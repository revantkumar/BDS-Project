Expanding opportunities for F-1 students is a slap in the face to Americans with STEM degrees who are being fired from their jobs and/or cannot find employment in their field. Any rules concerning immigrants MUST first take into account the impact on Americans and their job prospects. Otherwise it becomes just another crony capitalist play whereby you are rewarding cheap labor companies to the detriment of American workers. Not only do those cheap labor companies benefit in terms of salaries often half the prevailing wage but they also save in terms of healthcare and social security payroll taxes of these immigrants which the already devastated middle class then must cover. The American public in poll after poll have expressed these sentiments. Is this a government of the people, for the people and BY the people or have we become an autocracy where only the wealthy have a voice?
