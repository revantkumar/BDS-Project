The extention of 24 months of OPT in STEM subjects is very important to US. It is same with US country interests. Imagine that, some of the STEM PHD students are from outside of US, the US goverment and universities sponser their study. Without the 24 months extention, they have no choice but to go back to their own country. It is totally a waste of US's resources.
