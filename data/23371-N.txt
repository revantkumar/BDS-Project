To continue to repeat to these congressmen and senators what they already know is ridiculous. I just want to tell them that
as Americans become aware of what they're doing, we will respond by doing everything we can to see that they (Democrats 
and Republicans) are not re-elected. What we need is a good "House" and "Senate" cleaning to get rid of these despicable 
people who care nothing about the good of our nation and its citizens and are only self serving career politicians. We will be 
spreading the word about the ever expanding, terrible Optional Practical Training (OPT) program for foreign students that has
been one of the parts of the plan to destroy our economy. The real goal of the "powers that be" is their attempt to bring about 
the "New World Order" that President George H.W. Bush began to openly promote during his presidency. Obviously, not 
many Americans paid attention to his repeated globalist touting of a world-wide utopia. The question now is, "What else is 
there that we don't know about, and that no one in the news media is reporting on, that could or would bring about the 
destruction of the America we have loved?"
