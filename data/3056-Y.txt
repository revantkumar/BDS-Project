I fully support expanding the STEM OPT to 24 months. I am a STEM graduate who is helping a business to grow in the technology field. My employer could not find a US worker and is benefiting from my skills that I gained in graduate school.

Below are reasons why the US economy needs more STEM workers in fields of science, technology, engineering & mathematics.

1. Wages have grown relatively fast for most STEM-related occupations, which is a clear indication of shortage. From 2000 to 2013, analyzing Bureau of Labor Statistics data and adjusting for inflation, median salaries for workers in computer and mathematical, health care practitioner, engineering, and science occupations rose 8 percent, 7 percent, 6 percent and 5 percent respectively, even as those for the average U.S. worker showed no growth. Software developers, for instance, saw salaries soar 26 percent over the same period, culminating in an average of $82,000 in 2013, up from $48,000 in 1980.

2. In addition, vacancies for STEM jobs are going unfilled in large numbers. Burning Glass, a labor market analytics firm, analyzed a report and found there are some 40,000 computer science bachelor's degree earners each year but roughly 4 million job vacancies for computer workers. There is CLEARLY not enough supply of STEM students. 

3. In the private sector, software developers, petroleum engineers, data scientists, and those in skilled trades are in high demand. There are nearly not enough STEM student's to fill these positions. Expanding the STEM rule will help overcome the shortage and provide a significant boost to the US economy.

In conclusion, it is clear that US needs more STEM workers from reports and studies. DHS needs to pass this rule to help overcome the shortage otherwise this will set a huge setback for economy. International students bring talent and help business tremendously with STEM shortage.
