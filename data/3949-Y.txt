It would be definitely disappointing if US government stops this extension. 
The reason of prosperity is exactly a huge number of talents contributing their knowledge and technology to this open country. Taking a glance at high-tech companies and scientific research institutes, most employees are eagerly to hire students in STEM. Without the OPT extension, talented people would leave for other countries or homeland due to illegal status. We all know it would result in deadly development decrease, both in science and economy. 
Then, many prospective international students would reconsider their destination for study abroad. Even millions of parents participating their children's graduation ceremony spent billions of dollar here in less than one month, let alone the expense and tuition of international students during several years. 
To sum up, against extension rule would depresses long-term march and deviates from American dream. What government supposed to think about is how many years the extension should be, not deny the extension.
