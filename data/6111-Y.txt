It is such a wise way to give all the foreign students and this society a chance to improve themselves. Great companies will have more choices from new grads. And all the fresh grads will have more chances to contribute themselves to this society. They are educational, wise and creative.
It is a virtuous circle. Employer would have more choices, and more time to decide whether or not keep this nonimmigrant Student as an employee.
And employee will have more time to show their intelligence and ability to their employer. And as their competitors, they need to work harder, improve themselves to make sure they are not bet by these foreign fresh grads.

These students are contributed to this country, they are elites from all over the world, why not bring them to our society?
