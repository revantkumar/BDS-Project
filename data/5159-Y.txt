I believe that a huge part of the progress a diverse country like the United States has made and is making is because of the International support provided in the form of students gaining knowledge here. I Strongly support the extension of the STEM program so that the international students can get more exposure on the American work culture and later implement it for the betterment of the society here in the United states.
