This bill will greatly help tech companies hiring talented international students. I believe this could have significant impact to helping US to stay creative, maintain the leadership in science and tech fields around the world. Hundreds of thousand of young talents with stem extention could take benefit from this. Otherwise, they will have to go home, they are going to work in competitor countries like China, India, it will be tragedy to US. We will regret for losing talents I the near future.

With this program STEM students could stay here longer and get more chances for H1B poll. This will make US more attractive to international students. As more students coming, we have a bigger market, in both education and service industry. More money they spent in US will generate more job opportunities to local residents.

I strongly support the 24-month STEM program.
