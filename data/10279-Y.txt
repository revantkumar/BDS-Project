I support this proposal, for I knew the significance of those OPT STEM students. Most of them have strong technical levels. They graduated from some famous university, they acquired high level educations, and it is time to give contribution to the United States. Our U.S. Techniques need them to achieve a higher level. I never thought they were cheap labour. They do the same work, earn the same salary, pay the same tax. See their contributions, see what is happening in Silicon Valley, you still think they are cheap workers? They are treasures, they are great value of United States. 
Please see the international employees in Google, Microsoft, Intel and Facebook, without them, they do a great contribution to our daily life. Yes, I knew many U.S. native engineers are really great, while the fact is we have few and few students pursuing an engineer degree. That makes us dangerous in the international technical competition. We will fall behind if this continue. So to use the talent of OPT internationals, but not to repel them, this is our United States spirit, we have the confidence to contain and to compete. 
It is radiculus that some native engineers said OPT grabbed their jobs, making them unemployment. See how many more engineers our states need? The situation is we lack of great engineers and scientists, and you want to let them go, and filled the positions with unqualified native workers? That is the mislead to our country. 
Besides, I saw some OPTs started up their own company, they hired many Americans. So they give jobs or take jobs in the future, we cannot say now. Do not forgot our American spirit, we accept all kinds of people, all kinds of culture, and achieve our prosperity. If we lose that, we lose our nature and souls. 
That is what I want to comment here. Everyone here wishes a better tomorrow here.
