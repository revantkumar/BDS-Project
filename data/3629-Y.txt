"Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal." That was a speech delivered by Abraham Lincoln in 1864, 151 years ago. I truly believe in this continent every one deserves a equal right to work, to compete, to deliver value to the community and to pursuit their own happiness! I fully support this proposal. I don't think it will ever take away the equal opportunity of any American or any foreigner worker that wants to achieve his/her american dream to become an American resident because equal opportunity is meant for people who are qualified whether they are foreigner or natives. 

So the truth is those who ain't qualified still won't get the job even you are trying to reject this proposal. Those companies who can't find enough qualified workers in US will look for outsourcing which will end up with the same result or even worse result (resources are going out of US rather than stay in US if we cannot hire legal international workers locally!). Those who are qualified, whether they are native or international workers, they will get the job anyway as long as they have an equal opportunity to work here. 

This proposal is just trying to reserve resource for the homeland of US and attract talents. With or without this proposal, those arrogant and incompetent WATW workers will still be laid off due to outsourcing. On the other hand, if this proposal is passed some of the arrogant WATW workers may stand a chance because companies who can hire international resources without restrictions may tend to open more departments inside US.

In all, I fully support this proposal in the spirit of President Abraham Lincoln and all righteous US civil rights fighters!
