The US was built by immigrants, she became the leader of science and technology after WW2 because of the mass immigration of scientists and technicians from Europe. 

And now are we gonna just fear that, given the new generation of F1 students a 24 months period to get additional training they would take our jobs? How about people who always complain there's no job work harder, learn some skills, be more competitive in the market?

So you want to just REMOVE all the competitors and make us a what, better country? Or you just want to make your LAZY lives easier and let our nation slowly degrades, while you lie in your couch eating chips asking for easier jobs and higher pays and complain that we aren't as great a country as before, that US is losing competition to countries like China.

Chances should be given to all who deserves it, and if you don't want to fight for it, you don't deserve it. Giving F1 students an extended period to tryout, is bringing hard working people, smart brains and healthy competition, new blood to this country. It's not like we're handling them citizenship. 

And this new OPT plan will also regulate companies that hire F1 students, so that they won't underpay them, give them proper benefits, so that they won't just hire F1 students because they are cheap labor which make you lose your jobs.

For gods sake open your eyes and stop asking things to be made easier, and actually do something for this country but not just your own interest.
