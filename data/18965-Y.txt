Dear DHS,

I would like to express my fully support for enhance OPT extension for STEM degrees. I am an employee working in Applied Statistics/Data analysis field. The projects in my 

field as well as lots of STEM fields like computer science, statistic, industrial engineering and electrical engineering typically contains following phase: literature review, 

theoritical research, methodology development, prototype design, prototype test, production development, production test and release. Most projects last more than 2 years. 

The OPT extension can help both STEM student and US employee. For STEM student, with the help of OPT extension, they can practice their knowledge by participating whole life 

cycle of a project rather than only a few phases. For US employee, they can retain international students working for a whole project rather than training freshman very single 

year. Without a proper STEM OPT extension, people can predict a wide range of employee will Lose talents in the middle of projects, which will compromise project quality, 

reduce team efficient and cost employee a lot to find and training a replacement. 

Best,

Yue
