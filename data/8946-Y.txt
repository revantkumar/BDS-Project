I came to the States in 2008 and graduated from University of Tennessee last year. There are some people think that the international students in STEM majors are hurting US job market. Instead of debating with them, I would like to share the story of Min Kao, a UT alumni and Co-founder of Garmin Corporation. It is not difficult to calculate how much value he has created and how much contribution he has made to the society. But it will be hard to understand why there are some people who benefitted from Min Kao's GPS invention and donation would consider keeping international STEM students (like Min Kao) stay in US would hurt US economy.

"Min H. Kao was born in 1949 in a small town in Taiwan called Jhushan in Nantou. He attended college in Taiwan and received his doctorate in the US. 

Before founding Garmin, Min Kao served as a systems analyst at Teledyne Systems. Min Kao graduated from National Taiwan University with a BS degree then joined the University of Tennessee, where he earned his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering and was involved in research for NASA and the U.S. Army.

In 2005 Kao gave $17.5 million to the College of Engineering of the University Of Tennessee, $12.5 million of which was designated for the construction of a new facility." -- Wikipedia
