Zhibo Wang I must say that this policy is so good.

It will not hurt USA, actually it will helps USA, we know that every international student is the best student of their hometown, so let them work for USA will definitely develop the economics of USA.

What is more, it will attract more good students go to USA to study.

And the sprint of USA is about free and equality, so give everyone a chance to work in USA is the sprint of American dream!

So I totally agree with this policy!
