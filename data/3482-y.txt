Kingsley Wang I have to say, improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 students is a good thing for both of the US and the international students.

There are a lot of technologies companies in the US and they need thousands of people to work for them. At the same time, there are a lot of STEM degree students are international! And they have sound technology background to provide good energy for those companies. And also it is not a problem for the American students to find a STEM degree related job because there are a lot more companies only hire people of US citizenship. 

Those STEM degrees students will bring a huge economy benefit for the companies and the US society. But if they are only allowed to work for 12 month, the companies cannot get enough benefit from those students. 

On the other hand, more OPT time means international students have more time to get industry experience. That is more attractive for those students, who want to choose which country to study. More OPT time means US universities are more attractive than Europe universities. That is very important for universities in the US.

In conclusion, expanding training opportunities for F-1 students is a good thing for both of the US and the international students.
