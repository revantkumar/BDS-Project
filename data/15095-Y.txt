I strongly support this rule for several reasons:

1) This STEM OPT extension rule would greatly encourage talented young people from foreign countries to come to the US for study and work. They are NOT competing with Americans for jobs, but on the contrary, are boosting the US economy and creating more jobs for Americans. This makes the US a stronger country.

2) This rule would greatly enhance competitiveness of US in the international world. As we know, talented people are now the key factor to win in the world economy. All the other countries including China and India are trying their best to attract talented people with good bonus packages and good policies. STEM students from accredited universities are exactly the talented people we want. We, the US, should not lose in this battle.

3) US is an immigrant country, and should keep the spirit of diversity. Our ancestors were all from other countries a few centuries ago. Diversity has been made US the fastest growing country and now the most developed country in the world. We should not stop diversity from making us better.
