John Schwarzen This is definitely a great move! America need STEM employees. Some say foreign employees take US jobs, I do not think so. We really need those STEM talents create more Jobs for America. Manufacture jobs are coming backs to the US. It is only with those researchers and engineers, this is made possible. 

As far as I know, it is already hard for STEM students to get a working visa due to the lottery situation, not to say green card. This 2 year OPT extension would greatly relief their stress of finding a sponsor of the work visa. If we want to keep them, I say we make it not just longer OPT, but easier work visa and green card for those talented workers.

This is exactly the way that made United States of America great until 15 years ago. This is exactly what we should keep doing!
