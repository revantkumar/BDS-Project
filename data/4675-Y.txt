I STRONGLY SUPPORT the proposal. I dont really understand why people think it is a good idea to send those well trained students back to their countries. 

Think about it, the first thing will happen is that hundred of thousand employees from high tech industry have to leave in February, and this will destroy those big companies. For them, the loss of such an amount of human resources is unacceptable, and maintaining the leading position in the world will become almost impossible as a great portion of top level engineers and scientists going back to their homelands.

This problem is not about the job loss rate in three or five years, we are talking about decades. India, China, and Korea are main student sources, the technology and economics are growing fast in those countries. If they keep their best people in their industry as America keep kicking them out, nobody can guarantee we still have the best tank, best fighter, best computer or best cell phone in thirty years. People in those countries are working really hard, if we still want the strength to beat them in the future, either we work as much hard as they are or let them come and build stuff for us.

Remember, as the number of issued H1B visa stays the same, those students cant stay in America for too long. Make use of their brilliant mind to keep us leading is the world and *THEN* send them back definitely benefits us.
