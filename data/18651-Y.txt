I am working in a tech company in north California. I have lots of talented Chinese workmates who work hard and really good at what they're doing. If they can't get OPT extension they will all be sent back home, which is a great lost to my team and my company. I can't image my life and my company's future without them. Please SUPPORT and APPROVE the proposal for the new 24 month-extension of STEM OPT! Diversity is very important to America. I am looking forward to seeing more and more talented foreigners can have a bigger chance to work in and make great contributions to America.
