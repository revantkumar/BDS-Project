For the United States to remain the intellectual powerhouse of the world, to continue its advantage on high-tech industry, improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students is essential. It is not only beneficial to all these students with shiny eyes and bright dreams, but for the US, a country that boasts freedom and multiculturalism as well.

Worrying about domestic job positions is not a valid consideration. Many job positions won't be there in the first place if there weren't so many "aliens" creating them. They are hard working and they deserve to contribute to the community as well. Positions should be held by the most talented people, not those who "came here first", because the former promises greater efficiency, and their gratefulness will keep the United States the greatest country in the world even facing challenges from other countries. 

Openness was what made the US prosperous and dynamic, so how can it turn down the intellectual elites from all over the world to have a job and start a life here?
