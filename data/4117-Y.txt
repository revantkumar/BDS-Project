I strongly support the proposal as a recent graduated student who is working for a tech-startup in California. 

I'm always worried about my working status for the reason that I can only use OPT currently. It was really tough for me to find a job after my graduation because of the working status which would always terrify most of employers hiring foreigner people. All member in my startup care about me and are watching this proposal hoping it would help current tech-market and also they don't want to lose a friend and a good co-worker. My CEO and COO talked to me that they lose a couple of very talent employees before because of this OPT period is not enough for them to get a H-1B to keep working in company already.

In a word, this proposal to improve and expand OPT for those students would definitely help them get real training after graduation and make contribution to society for sure.
