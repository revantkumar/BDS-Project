This 24-month OPT STEM extension can help US employers to maintain a steady workflow and reduce the cost of unpredictable hiring, repeated training and extended transition. More importantly, millions of US dollars have been invested annually in the US educational system which are shared by students from all over the world. It is very logical to keep these high skilled PhD or Master international students in the United States and let them work and contribute to this country, rather than send them away or even serve opponents. Additionally, this extension will be another good practice of equal employment opportunity. The whole country will benefit from the prosperity and diversity brought by this change.
