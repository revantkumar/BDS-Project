I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. If the extension is cancelled, this obeys the reason why the universities accepts international students. The international students come to the USA, working here, benefits the USA a lot. Usually, the international students can share the works the natives don't like to do. They are not competing with the natives, but helping them. Furthermore, the USA is a country that contains variety and diversity. There is no reason to refuse the international because in the past years, lots of the achievement are reached because there's the help from the international people.
