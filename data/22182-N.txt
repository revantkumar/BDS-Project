I oppose the expansion of the time frame that foreign students may work in the US. America foresaw shortages of workers in the sciences, and STEM programs popped up in schools all over the country. It is now an extremely popular program. I have two sons in the science fields in college and I don't want them to graduate and be jobless so companies can hire low wage foreign students/recent graduates.
