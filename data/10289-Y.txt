Our country spends a lot of money to support STEM research projects in graduate school. Then we use the money to hire a lot of international students to work on those projects. They learn to be talented problem solvers in graduate school. If we let them go back to their countries after they get their degrees, then what is the purpose of giving them the free high-level education? They come to this country to learn from the best for FREE. And then we let them go back to serve their home countries? Are we stupid or what? So the idea of OPT extension is indeed a good idea to let those talented international students pay back our money before they go back to serve their home countries.
