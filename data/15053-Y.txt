I can feel the power of the country of freedom from this proposed regulation. The U.S. is known to be the land of freedom where encourages people to work hard. STEM students spend hours and hours doing labs and researches to earn their degrees and apply their knowledge to make a strong technology world. STEM jobs pay well which means STEM students will pay decent amount of taxes to help the society. International STEM students have way less opportunities to get financial aids from the school and from the government, they don't share the benefits with the local residents while they pay taxes to benefit the local community. The U.S. was founded less then 300 years ago but now it's one of the most powerful countries in the world, one of the reason why it's growing so fast is that people from all over the world who work hard land here and keep working hard to build this community. STEM students are just like all the people who came to the U.S. over the 239 years, they are not different from many of the ancestors of the current Americans. Why can't the land of freedom give those STEM students just 24 months of freedom to work hard and make contributions to the United States of America?
