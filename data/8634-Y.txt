I strongly support the extension. The talent people from all over the world made USA a great country. The development in science and technology made USA rich, thus reducing the cost of living. With people rich, the demand for others (living, transportation, ...) can increase as well, rendering more open positions in other fields, then the whole economy is healthy.
If the extension is cancelled, in a short term, the unemployment rate in high tech field may decrease because of the sudden leaving of these talent workers. However, in a long term, complains about the living expense and economy retardation in economy will show up soon. For small tech companies, it will become a disaster immediately. For big companies, in my opinion, their strategy will be developing branches in other countries, where there are full of high tech workers, like China, India, with much less wage payment than USA. The adverse effects are obvious: less tax paid in USA and less high tech positions available for Americans. If these new graduated STEM students turn their wheels, it will be never possible to get them back.
As a summary, high tech is the base of America, and high tech workers is the base of high technologies and sciences. No body can take the responsibility making USA declining. As other countries are looking for methods to attract high tech workers, USA cannot walk against the trend.
