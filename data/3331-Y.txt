I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. We all know there are a lot of Mexican, Spanish and people from other countries. Those people cannot make a contribution to the nation but they can stay. Is that wired to deny the high degree students who can make great contribution to US? Lots for great people came from foreign students.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Competition can help find the best one to fit the best position. No matter they are foreign students or not, they will make U.S more competitive through the whole world.
