I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:

1. The governmentshould let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S..
2. Diversity is veryimportant for the U.S..
3. Competition doesexist, but is not a bad thing.
4. I am a student who loves U.S very much. Love the life hereand love the people here. I really hope I can work in U.S during the opt extension. Those maybe the last days I can stay in U.S.
