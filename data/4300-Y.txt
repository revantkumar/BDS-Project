I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.
I am so confused about the people who are not agree with the proposal.Just thinking about who can apply the extension, they are the students who are highly educated. If these students can work in US, it should be a great benefit to this country. For example, I am an international electrical engineering master student. Before I came to US, I had multiple choices to pursue my master degree such as UK, Canada, Australia etc. However, I chose America. The most important reason I chose here is that US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school and after graduation. And also, I would like to practice myself and then make a contribution to the development of US. Thus OPT extension is very important to attract international student. Without this extension, I can't believe US could still attract so many talented people to come here. Furthermore, a lot of high-tech companies like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc, they are supported by huge number of foreign STEM talents. I think if this extension is no longer existed, they will bear huge damage and it will have a great effect on economy of US. That's the reason why I support this proposal and I hope more people can understand this idea and put up your hands!
