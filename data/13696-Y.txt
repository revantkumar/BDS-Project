I am an American citizen born in the USA who works and lives in the Silicon Valley area as an engineer. I am opposed to the new rule based on my experience in Silicon Valley, having seen US citizen engineers with STEM degrees and relevant work experience either have trouble finding work or dropping out of the field altogether.

-"Unlike its counterparts in other countries, which rely on their own operatives, China's intelligence service deploys a freelance network including students, resea
