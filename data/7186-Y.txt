Yang Bai, Inventiv Health Hi,dear government,
International students already contribute lots of to US through tuition and hard work during school. They really need working experiences to practice what they have learned from schools. If the extension is canceled then Us will lose tons of good students from worldwide and U.S. Tech will not be the best.
Thank you
