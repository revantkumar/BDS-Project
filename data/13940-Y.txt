I strongly SUPPORT then proposal for the following reasons:

The majority of the IT companies, such as Google, the Amazon, etc. are founded by immigrants. These companies provide so many occupations to the citizens.

Most software development projects would last 2 years or more. Foreign STEM workers worked on those projects would lose their VISA before the project completion, and the those projects may be disrupted.

The STEM opt extension make the U.S. academic sector remain competitive globally. Other countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, China, Australia are actively instituting new strategies to attract international students. The U.S. will suffer from these if the STEM was cancelled.
