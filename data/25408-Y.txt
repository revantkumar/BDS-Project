Stem OPT extension is significant for not only foreign students but only American residence.
it is clear that OPT extension provides foreign students with larger opportunities for their personal development
besides it is of great help to create an multi-cultural working environment in a company or a department, and it is for sure that everyone in American wants this country to be better and better. With foreign students work here to provide our knowledge, our thoughts and ideas, it is for the future of the country.
most opponents worry that foreign students take up job opportunities. This is not complete true. We actually create a favorable atmosphere of competition, which is good for every students. We came here to study and actually we've made contributions to American economy. 
I fully advocate STEM OPT extension!
