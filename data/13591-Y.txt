I strongly support the expansion of training opportunities for Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. With those opportunities, the international students can fulfill their dreams. With the excellent and high-quality nonimmigrant students, United States can utilize their intelligence, creativity, enthusiasm and diversity to make further progress in both academic and industrial areas, and obtain faster economic growth which will create more job opportunities and is helpful to every U.S. citizen.
