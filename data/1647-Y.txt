I absolutely support the OPT extension. It is a win-win policy for both USA and foreign students. 
Firstly, the students who have received high level education are skilled and passionate about working in related fields in the state, so that with a longer extension, students can accumulate more experience from work.
More importantly, during the extension, students provide more services to the society. 
Specifically, previous records demonstrate that most of the STEM major students have entered the high technology fields, such as IT companies in CA, WA, TX and NY, etc. Their contributions boost the economic growth. 
Also the manufacturing industry can benefit from this policy. 
For example, the rejuvenation of the Detroit area would take many years. 
With continuous fresh bloods, including skilled foreign students of STEM major (i.e. mechanical engineering, vehicle engineering, electrical/computer engineering, civil engineering, etc.), the auto manufacturing industry there can step into a new era (i.e. autonomous driving technology and smart city planning). Therefore, the growing market will bring more job opportunities for local citizens in future.
