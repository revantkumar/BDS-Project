I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge and gain skills from U.S. universities and colleges stay in the country and let them keep making great contributions to the U.S especially in the area of STEM.

2. USA has a long history of great diversity, and different groups of people have contributed a lot for the developement of the country.

3. The booming of economy needs innovation, and students of STEM area will definitely contribute a lot for leading great innovation, and if they are not allowed to stay in America, they can hardly add value to the innovation development of this country.
