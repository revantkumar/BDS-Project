Jay Satter I feel Congress and the President do not have the best interest of the American people at heart. With 89,000,000 out of work,and many of those already given up looking for work,,,not counted in the unemployment rate.. We must stop this immediately... this country needs Americans to work, with 41,000,000 people on food stamps. We don't need more immigrants, legal or illegal. This cost will be the downfall of our once great Country!
