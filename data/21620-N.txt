Our President and our Government has a solemn duty to protect our country and the American people. This duty and obligation is not limited to protection but the overall welfare of it's citizens. And that includes their way of life, their jobs and a fair and balanced trade agreement that levels all playing fields. It has been nothing short of a slpap in the face to American workers when a President circumvents our laws and his solemn oath, to allow foreign workers and illegal immigrants to enter our country, for Political greed and votes.
