Lots of natives are talking about aliens taking their jobs. But guess what? If you are as capable as those "aliens" and you don't need VISA you will be pursued by tons of recruiters on some of the six-figure salary jobs. 
Those "aliens" get hired NOT because they are cheap (and in fact, they are NOT cheap, it COSTS to pay for VISA applications and immigration), but because they have skills and experiences. 
I find it ironical that those who advocates tightening work VISA policy are the same group of people who want more benefits like food stamps. 
And even more ironically, these "aliens" do pay taxes which is the main source of your food stamps.
