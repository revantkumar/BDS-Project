I fully support the new change of increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months instead of the current 17 months. I believe this increased duration of practical training (OPT) is important for students like me to fully utilize the education they have received.

As Benjamin Franklin said- Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn. Adding 24 month extension will definitely help the students to grow professionally and technically by utilizing the skills learnt in their respective STEM programs. This active involvement would definitely improve the success rate of US education system thereby attracting more talent in the country!
