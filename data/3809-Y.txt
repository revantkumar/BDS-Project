I Strongly support this rule. Because skilled people contribute to this country. They are called ELITES. 

I saw many comments object this rule and most common one are saying that foreigners will take US Citizens' job. It is not necessary to think in that way. Why? US Citizens are knowledgeable and strong. This new rule won't freak them out.

This new rule is substantial to make two-win. This new rule should be accepted and officially proved.
