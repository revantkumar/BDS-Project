Anonymous You know the argument. You've heard it before from hundreds of thousands of American citizens. Put Americans first, before foreigners. We're in the slowest recovery since WWII, and most of the jobs created are low paying jobs. Why in the world would you give foreigners preference to the remaining high paying jobs?

When are our leaders going to start to do the will of the people? The people clearly do not want any more immigration, no matter how you disguise it.

I shouldn't be afraid to give my name, but these are scary times of government overreach, so I believe I'll not.
