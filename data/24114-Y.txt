I am an international student applying for the program of computer science in 2016 fall. The reason why I want to get advanced education in America rather than other countries is that first, America indeed has a better academic environment, better education resources like professors and programs; Second, the opportunity to work in IT companies to get more related industrial experience. And I think the The proposed rule seeks to ensure that the STEM OPT extension more effectively enables STEM OPT students to obtain valuable practical work experience directly related to their fields of study. Without the practical experience, I will not be competitive in the job market of China. And in that concern, the attraction of studying abroad will decrease in many potential STEM students. In consequence, the education field and IT industry will all get influenced. I've known many international students who did a great job while studying in America, helping professors accomplish the project and contributing to the IT development. Besides, students who got more practical experience in industrial work mostly could get a better job when coming home. To be a better developer even to create my own business in the future, I hereby, vote for this proposal.
