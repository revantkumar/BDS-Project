24-month extension is NECESSARY, especially for advanced degree graduates. The possibility to get H1B visa through H1B lottery is getting lower and lower year by year due to the increasing candidate pool. 17-month extension is not enough anymore. One has to leave the company even if he/she is in an important position simply because he/she couldn't win the lottery!!! It absolutely a loss for both sides. Therefore, I strongly support the expanding of OPT extension to 24-month or even longer to decrease personnel loss on important or critical position.
