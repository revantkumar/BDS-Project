I strongly SUPPORT the OPT extension. Currently I am starting my own startup. I find that it is extremely hard to hire talented people. However, the international students are very hardworking and they are willing to work in my company without H1B visa sponsorship. They just want such a training experience. I really appreciate it that there are OPT opportunities. For those international students, it is a chance to apply what they have learned to real industry. For companies, we can hire those talented people from all over the world. The most important, it is a treasure for the US. That is the reason why APPLE, GOOGLE and FACEBOOK are from the US.

The OPT extension will help the small tech startups to survive. Don't kill next GOOGLE or FACEBOOK. Please approve the OPT extension.
