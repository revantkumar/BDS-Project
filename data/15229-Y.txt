Salil Rai I urge everyone involved to please consider this. It is a very important curve in any humans life and to be uncertain about it, doesn't help. Specially, for just a small reason of not being able to work here legally. I am a student who does not come under STEM. But, I fully support this for those who are. It is very vital that the rules be a little more relaxed when it comes to work visa for international students.
