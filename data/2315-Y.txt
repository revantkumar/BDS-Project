A great percentage of students in graduate programs in STEM majors are international students. Wouldn't it be beneficial for this country to keep the students we have invested millions of dollars in their training? If we don't give them the opportunity to stay we will be letting the highly trained to leave and go to another country that will benefit from our "investment."
