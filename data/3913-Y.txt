I support to extend the OPT time for STEM. This is a freedom land and now US economy is seems to going down. If Home Land Security rejects this rule, this country will lost lots of genius and the IT industry will be caught up by Indian and China, maybe in a few of years. For the long term, it's really good for our country to maintain the competitiveness. They are friendly as we are. How can we lost them?
