American was created by immigrants, but now some people try their best to keep new immigrants from entering this country.
skilled immigrants have made huge contributions in the innovation and ground breaking research. With this comes more jobs and opportunities. Skilled immigrants are mostly industrial, law-abiding and well-educated, needless to say the CEOs of Google and Microsoft are both new immigrants. These people can create enormous economic and technological values in US,which benefits everyone in US. Many immigrants have spent couples of years in US colleges and they are well-aware of the cultures and laws in US, most of them speak fluent English. I don't see why there are still some Americans cannot see the value of these skilled immigrants and are so eager to maintain the "white dominance" in this country.
