Johanna Press I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. The STEM extension provides international students with an invaluable opportunity to further develop the skills they gained in college while contributing to the US economy. Moreover, these highly-trained STEM students serve as an irreplaceable resource to businesses in the US that are in need of a skilled, technical workforce. The STEM extension thereby creates a win-win situation where the international students working in their dream jobs enable the US to maintain its status as a global leader in STEM industries.
