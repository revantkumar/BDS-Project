I strongly support this proposal: 

Technology is key to economic and U.S. is loosing its advantage:
STEM education is the key to the U.S.'s economic future and without doubt, F-1 non-immigrant STEM students are making huge contributions to U.S. Many scholars even suggest that we need to encourage more students to pursue science, technology, engineering, and math [1]. Other countries like India, China and many others have verity ways to improve technology development and they move extremely fast. In my graduate school, at least half of STEM students having F-1 visa and their handwork and willing to contribute to U.S. is a gift for technology companies. In my new joined, one of the largest technology company, huge amount of employees are working with OPT permission. Silicon valley has tons of new ideas and technologies, without these hardworking F-1 students, these awesome ideas would quickly be implemented by others. Top technology companies will soon losing advantage.
