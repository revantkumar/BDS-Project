YANPING HUANG Strongly support the proposal.

The diversity is a important element of US. The extension of OPT allows the companies to better choose talents and keep their diversity.

In addition, many positions need skilled people while the companies cannot find any suitable local who would like to. 

To prevent the abuse of OPT program, further rules can be applied like student from specific ranks of university can be allowed and company on the black list are banned to recruit.
