It's the diversity and non-discrimination that make the United States the most powerful country in the world, with the world's most advanced technology. As we know the international labors have made significant contributions to the American's society, which has proved and is now proving in technical companies such as those in Silicon Valley. With the 24-month extension, it's very advantageous that the United States can have much better chance to keep the most intelligent engineers and scientists all over the world, which is beneficial to the leading position of the United States, thus its citizens life with high quality. It doesn't hamper the quality of the citizens life at all, since most jobs are in engineering and science that only a very small proportion of the American citizens are engaged in, but without it the U.S. may not be able to be that powerful in its leading science and technology.
