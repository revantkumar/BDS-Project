Donald Whitten I completely SUPPORT 24 month OPT extension. From those negative comments, it seems in a short term foreign students may compete with native citizens in job market. However, in the long run this rule can bring a lot benefits to US.
1. This rule encourages more and more excellent foreign students come and study in US. Their tuition and living expenses greatly excite the US economy: restaurants, clothing stores, car dealers and apartment rental companies, all of them need large numbers of consumers. 
2. Healthy competition is necessary. Without competition, the whole social development would become slow. After graduation, excellent foreign students may have opportunities to work in US and they have abilities to make great contributions to every aspect in US society, including the job market. A prosperous job market will certainly offer lots of opportunities to US citizens.
