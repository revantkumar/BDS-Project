'OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.'

Explain to me how replacing U.S. workers with foreign labor is BEST for the U.S. and why the Federal Government is obviously more for the foreigner than for the U.S. citizen/worker?

When Social Security is being harmed by these foreigners and money is desperately needed to fund the program, why implement more foreigners to rape the SS program to the tune of a billion dollars a year?

When is the Federal Government going to put the U.S. citizen/worker/taxpayer first? Our elderly need their SS and they need it now!!! Our taxpayers provide this support....foreign workers obviously don't!
