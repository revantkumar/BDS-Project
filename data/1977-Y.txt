I definitely support the new OPT extension rule. As an Electronic Engineering master from China, we have faced so many difficulties in America such as language, race, long distance and family economic stress. When I go into the society, a lot of companies just want Native Americans. It is hard for international student to compete with Native Americans in the same level. Such rule reduces our opportunities to find a normal job. The new OPT extension will definitely relieve our stress to some extent.
At the same time, foreign students regularly contribute a significant amount of money into the U.S. economy. According to statistics compiled by the Association of International Educators (NAFSA), foreign students made a net contribution of $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy in the 2013-2014 academic year. This contribution included tuition ($19.8 billion) and living expenses for self and family ($16.7 billion), after adjusting for U.S. financial support ($9.7 billion). And public colleges and universities particularly benefit from the payment of tuition by foreign students, especially in comparison to the tuition paid by in-state students. 
In fact, as an international student, I just want to work in America for some years and I would return back China eventually. If I have about 3 years work experience in US, I would be competitive in the job market of China. That's why this new OPT rule would benefit both US high-tech industry and international STEM talents.
