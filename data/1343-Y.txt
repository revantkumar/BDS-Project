I strongly SUPPORT the extension.

I think international students who graduated from U.S university is of outstanding performance on study. They will also perform equally excellent or more than expectation on career.

The competition for finding a job with natives does have, but that does NOT mean there will be no good aspect.

One good thing is that, with intense competition, the young generation will become more hard-working on their studies at school. If that the amount of juvenile crime will decrease, and they will grow up under an safe and wonderful environment. With more good, I believe the US will become more powerful, living quality for people will become good than ever before.
