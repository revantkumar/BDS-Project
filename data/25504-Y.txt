There is a huge gap between the needs of employees by companies in the STEM fields and the number of qualified workers 
that can accomplish the jobs. International students in the STEM fields have been serving as a strong source for these employers,
as well as for the American high-tech industry. As valuable human resource, students graduated from the U.S. universities would
improve the overall quality of the entire industry in the U.S.. This may also be a major reason why lots of STEM companies stay 
in the United States.

Note that only students who graduated from the U.S. universities will be qualified for this extension, who are also the population 
that received the benefits from the U.S. education system, which is supported by US taxpayers. Providing the 24-month OPT 
extension is a way to test the quality of the students, and to potentially keep the investments by the country, and the tax payers. 

It is unavoidable that competition will be brought in when foreign students are given more time to find a job in the U.S. 
However, if such an opportunity is not provided, these students who have obtained their knowledge in the U.S. will leave the 
country, and easily find a job at another country that are more open to immigrant professionals and competing with the United 
States. Eventually the US may lose its place in the high-tech competition, and even destroy its economy.
