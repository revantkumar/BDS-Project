V Pringle Dear Mr President,
Will you please stop trying to tear our
country apart. It seems the closer you get
To the end of your term the more things
You are trying to push that will collapse
This country even more. Please stop thinking
About votes and start thinking about
The Americans that you were hired to
Protect. Thank you.
