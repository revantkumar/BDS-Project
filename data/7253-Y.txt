I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The extension proposal keeps it competitive for both US's industry sector and academia sector. STEM students are a major workforce for leading companies and institutes in the US. These talents have made great contribution to keep companies and institutes competitive among other countries. Without the extension, a majority of these talents will leave US for competitors in other countries. Finally, companies and institutes in US will suffer from losing talents.

2. The extension is critical for STEM students to gain meaningful training experience. A solid project, in industry or in academia, usually spans multiple years. Without extension, a 12-month OPT will limit the opportunities of STEM students to participate in a good project, and the quality of training experience will largely compromised.

3. Finally, STEM students are sponsored by various research funding which comes from the money of tax payers. If these students leave the country after graduation without any contribution to the society, it is a huge waste of money.
