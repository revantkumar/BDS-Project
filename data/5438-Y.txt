Sandra Kerr As a citizen of the United States for many years, I've seen and experienced unemployment and underemployment. Also, as a graduate of an Electronics Engineering program in 1996,I did not find a job in that field.Many companies were like my employer and did not hire or promote females in that field without incentives. The government's insistence on keeping those jobs for foreigners inhibits Americans of all kinds from obtaining gainful employment. Extending foreign students ability to stay in the U.S.should only be considered in a good economic environment when most citizens are employed.

Do not extend student visas to three years.
