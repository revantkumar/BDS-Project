Gautham Deva I strongly support STEM opt extension. To blame the declining US workforce in companies on increasing number of stem students isnt a fair argument.At graduate level the number of international students outweigh the number of domestic US students inspite of paying fees close to 3 times what the local students play. So to say cheap labour is reason for such high number of stem students is wrong.People come to US to live the American dream and to argue that after paying such humungous amounts of fee ,students fall for uncompetitive, not to the market standard salaries is absurd.No one wants to do that.It is an individual students interest in advanced science degrees that drives him/her to US. 
Infact it is difficult these days for an international student to land a good job as companies prefer to fill their positions with local candidates to reduce the various high visa related fees.So an inteenational student is hired because their qualification and also because the company failed to get a good local candidate.Again,despite the additional expenses that company has to spend on STEM student they still hire him/her and that is certainly not cheap labor.
There are thousands of students working in major companies like face book Google and apple and discontinuing STEM opt system would greatly impact such companies and they will end up outsourcing the work to companies in other countries anyway.
For years,US had been the place to be for many students fulfilling their dreams and providing 24 month extension would ultimately Benifit not just them but also hundreds of companies that rely on them. Revoking the stem opt rule would ultimatley stop students from coming to us thus impacting hundreds of univs that charge large tuitions as they lose a major source of revenue.
Finally a 24 month opt extension would provide the student a fair chance to make a career here in US and at the end contribute to the growth of the country's economy
