This is just another example of government corruption concerning ALL aspects of immigration. I vote NO to this. 
We have enough skilled workers in the US that are out of work. Both legal and particularly ILLEGAL aliens are taking jobs 
away from LEGAL Bona-fide US American Citizens. Enough is enough. The government needs to get tough and deport
all the illegals and cut back severely on legal immigration also, to include this type.
