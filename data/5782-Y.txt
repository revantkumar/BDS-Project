Huijun Zuo I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:
1. It's good for US education since longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in US.
2. It's the American spirit to give everyone equal change. Everyone have to be excellent and hard working regardless of their races. Losing job opportunities is just an excuse for local people to get lazy and not work hard. Because everyone have the same opportunity. You want to get a job, just make yourself better.
3. It's good for US economy. Having talented foreign people working in US will produce more job opportunities.
