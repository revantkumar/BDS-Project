As a foreign student, I love this policy. We are actually not competing with American workers. Instead we are helping the company making profit so that they could create more job opportunities for us citizens. Furthermore, we are not only known because our low salary compared with us citizens. We are more industrious and have specialised skill. US does not have that much workforce for some kind of job like coder and engineer, so we make up the empty space. 
Anyway it's a great policy and I do not like to see it disappears because of some extremely conservative comments.
