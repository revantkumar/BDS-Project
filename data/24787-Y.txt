Hi,

This is a bad bad policy. You guys are doling out EADs with out any enforcement measures. People get their EADs and work in gas stations, grocery stores etc. and they compete with Americans. There is no prevailing wage requirement for the EAD and hence it is very appealing to the employers. Americans in High tech field cannot compete with someone in EAD who is willing to accept lower pay just so they can stay in status. These are not the best and the brightest. Come to US, get a MS degree from any small university(For example NPU in Fremont, which doles out these degress enmasse), and try to find a job at whatever wage. Please do not give EADs to foreign students with out a prevailing wage requirement like H-1b, fraud detection mechanisms, strict unemployment clause i.e if unemployed for more than 30 days, out ot status etc. Please just do not give out EADs to masses and masses of people.

Why the administration is giving out EADs, starting with H-4s, and now to Students is beyond me. It is the immigration lobby which is winning at the cost of struggling Americans. 

Thanks
Rhonda
