Yong Li I am here to present my support to the STEM OPT Extension rule.

The employees in STEM area are usually excellent ones equipped with high-level technology. They are usually working on some specific high-tech projects or assignments. 

Since the assignments or projects are typically about research or specific science/engineering tasks, it typically needs some training aiming at the specific position to make the employees better putting what they have learnt during school period into practice. Thus, if OPT extension is canceled, that is only one year OPT for the students and companies, then the actual time length the students serving their employers is very very limited considering the training period. There would be less and less companies to hire entry-level new graduates -- as is well know, a robust company stuff structure consists of various ages, thus the age gap must lead to server problems for the companies and the industry as well.

Furthermore, many research or projects are lasting for several months or years. So if the Extension canceled, even though companies are trying their best to finish training as soon as the employee hired, the employments would be meaningless, which will absolutely result in less employments and do harm to the industry.
