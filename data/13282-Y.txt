I strongly SUPPORT the OPT extension proposal for international STEM students.

Firstly, international students are making significant contributions to the U.S., immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed over 3 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010.STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world. Every year, H1b holders pay more than 27%, and more often more than 30% of their salary to the federal, and even more to the federal and the state. Those money were used in increasing medical, education, construction and other welfare of American people. 

Secondly, rejecting international STEM students will let those thousands of highly educated people go back to their own countries or go to other welcoming countries, they will devote to scientific research, entrepreneurship, public policy and other fields that empower and create jobs for the country they serve for. The most common example is the constitution of professors in the US universities, for most universities, at least half of the professors are from foreign countries rather than US. 

Thus, rejecting international STEM students' OPT extension equals to let the talented people to create next Alibaba in other countries, not next face-book in the US!
