Richard Mayo I can't believe that our country is actually considering having more Americans laid off and replaced by foreign workers, this is insane. Congress likes to believe that the foreign workers are doing jobs that Americans don't want. Tell that to the millions of Americans in technology fields who are losing their jobs.
