I strongly support this policy. These students will apply what they learn from US universities to companies and help companies thrive, therefore boosting US economy and create more jobs for US citizens as well. They are not taking away jobs, imagine how would these high tech companies reach today's achievement without hiring foreign STEM students. One need to understand that the whole society is not a zero-sum game.
