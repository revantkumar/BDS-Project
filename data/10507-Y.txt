Rajender Reddy Padira It is very good proposal (Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students) and I think it is very important to extend the OPT, since some students graduated from the colleges of USA could make a contribution to the development of companies in the USA. In addition, students need more time to show their potential in the companies. So I hope to extend the OPT for F1 students. It could not only help students show their potential but also make a contributions to the development of technologies in the USA.
