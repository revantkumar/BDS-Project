I strongly appreciate this proposed rule because it is really a win-win strategy for both US and international students. International students can have a very valuable opportunity to work in US using the knowledge they learned here, and on the other hand, US students will have great opportunity to compete and in future work with highly talent people from all over the world. 
Also US companies can create values by hiring top tech international students, which can bring more revenue and then be converted to tax for IRS. 

After reviewing those negative comments who object the proposed rule, I found the main reason was they are really afraid that US citizens will lose their jobs in all the industries. But it will not be the case: the proposed rule only benefits international employees who attained their STEM degree in US and OPT extension only allows them to work in tech industry for couple of months. It will not bring lone-term effect on local US students. Second, it was because US citizens cannot fill in those positions in those tech industry that international student can come in. In most cases, US tech companies definitely prefer US citizens over international students if they have the same skill set and capability because they can work here without any restrictions whereas international students need sponsor from those tech companies. So this rule will not effect the employment situation of local US tech students.
