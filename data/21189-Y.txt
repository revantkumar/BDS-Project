The main trouble with us today is the fact we spend too much effort helping others that don't benefit America. People on welfare or unemployment have too much time trying to keep occupied. Kids standing around with nothing to do but thinking up things to keep busy involves into serious trouble, thus gangs, shooting and other crimes. Even the people that see others coming into our country and getting all the benefits while they do without causes a backlash into resentment and more trouble. Some are lashing out now with the authorities and with the crime rising as it has been. I don't see that it is going to get better unless we start with our own people first. With our own unemployment as it is, bringing in more people for whatever cause only makes it worse. I am glad in a way that I am older, but I fear for what it is becoming with the generation growing up in today in this garbage.
