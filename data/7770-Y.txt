I strongly support this new policy of OPT extension for international student in STEM major. Without this policy, there will be a significant negative impact on scientific research in STEM area. 

Firstly, if there is only one year OPT, many international student in STEM major will no long consider finding a training opportunity in US after they graduated. Instead they will consider job opportunities in other countries with better policy for international student and contribute their skills and knowledge to those countries. 

Secondly, many international students are top students in their home country, they choose US for further education is not only because US has excellent educational system, but also has friendly policy to international student, otherwise, they could have pursue their education in UK, Canada, or European countries which have competitive science and technology with US. 

Thirdly, many institutional research labs have around 50% of their group members from foreign countries. If the number of international applicants to Universities or scientific research institutes decreases significantly, many research groups will not be able to hire enough students to work on their projects, therefore will considerably impede the scientific research progress in STEM area.

Fourthly, international students help establish international collaborations in scientific research. Many of them will build their own research group in their home countries and seek collaborations with US University. And in most US University, especially in the Department of STEM major, many Professors are from foreign countries and they can take advantage of their connections with their home countries to bring international collaborations to US.
