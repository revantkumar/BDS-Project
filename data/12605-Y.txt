I think the government need to get some data in detail to see if OPT stem students are taking over citizen's jobs. Based on my understanding, they are not. In the labor market, there are more demand than supply in the high tech field. That's the reason why we need more high tech major students to stay after graduation and help our economy and society. If there are no such labor supply, I do not think our demand could be filled with qualified labor. The high tech fields are growing very fast today and we need more ppl to work in these fields and make our life easier without too much pressure. In the long run, improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees will help us a lot. I strongly support government to improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees and CapGap Relief for all Eligible F-! students.
