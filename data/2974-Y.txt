I totally support for the proposal that aims at improving and expanding OPT period. 

Needless to say that foreign STEM students have a HUGE POSITIVE impact on the American economy in the contemporary era, their contribution have eased the conflicts between the demand of high-tech workforce and the shortage of QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. 

If there is anyone arguing that Americans are losing job opportunities because of the STEM policies, which in their mind hurt American STEM workers, they must ignored a FACT - FREE CONTENTION IN THE JOB MARKET. Why? Because they are too weak to admit that they cannot get a job because they are not as qualified as those foreign STEM workers. Their in-qualification cannot be changed no matter STEM policies exist or not. 

The policy makers should never close a door where so many great foreign STEM workers have entered US and created all kinds of improvements to this country.
