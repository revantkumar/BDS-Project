It is unconscionable that our government would encourage foreign students to stay in the U.S. and compete with our own students in the STEM field. Why is the government willing to do this? Is it because people like Bill Gates and other CEO's in this field make big donations to the Democrat party??
Enough is enough. We should not be engaging in "pay to play" politics and forget who we should be looking out for, mainly U.S. citizens! 
Only U.S. citizens should be working in the U.S. legally! 
Thank you for your time.
