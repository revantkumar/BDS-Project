I strongly support the new proposed HLS rule to extend the OPT period due to several reasons, the most important of which are 1) High tech industry is very demanded and important for US. 2) US government is financially support the foreign student for their study and afterward, they are made to exit the country and take their expertise out of the country. It is opposing the national interest 3) They are mostly among the top and most successful students/future workers of their own country that are adsorbed by the US educational system and not giving them the chance to stay is a waste of talents and skills. 4) Compared to the other programs such as DV lottery, it is a very systematic way of adsorbing the skillful and intelligent individuals.

So, I would highly support the new rule.
