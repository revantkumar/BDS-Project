I strongly support the proposal,as an electrical engineer in the future, for the following reasons:

1 As being an international student, the reason I choose to come here for my graduate study is that I admire the working environment of tolerance and opportunity, rather than just the high quality education. I believe that a lot of excellent talents have the same idea with me, and more of them will choose in the United States for a more friendly OPT policy. 
2 International students, who are able to obtain their opt in the Unite States, are always the best of them. They are not cheap labor, and they are engaged in the work with the most economic benefit. The only reason that they are qualified for this job, is that their ability to pay more, and have better skills. Most of them will bring the breakthrough of science and technology, or economic growth to the country. They never take the easy jobs from US citizen, because they are the best men from all over the world, who will only focus on meaningful things.
