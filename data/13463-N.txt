I think this is just lazy politics. Many Americans do not have a job and would be more than happy to have a decent job.
I think America is helped when more Americans are working and paying taxes.
If Americans are as dumb and unqualified in certain sectors as the biased media believes, then why doesn't the government invest in education and training for
the 21st century?

America is the land of plenty but has so much poverty that is shameful.

It seems that multinational companies are just telling the government to do, as they probably already bought the politicians
with their campaign donations.
This is a giveaway to companies since they can pay foreign workers less.
These companies are only loyal to themselves, not to the USA.
