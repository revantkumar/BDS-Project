The desire of this administration to put immigrants ahead of American Citizens is appalling. I am completely in disagreement with this policy change. It must not go forward. There is no compelling reason to treat immigrants better than Citizens. The Obama Administration should be ashamed for even suggesting something so outrageous not to mention trying to sneak it through without the review process. This is an affront to every American and yet another attempt to denigrate true American Citizenship.
