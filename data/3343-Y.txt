I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S.
2. Competition do esexist, but is not a bad thing. Competition can help U.S.find better talents.
