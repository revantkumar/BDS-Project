Strongly support improving and expanding training opportunities for F1 no immigrant students with STEM degrees. It is a win-win situation for both the industry in the U.S. and students development. F1 students paid for the education and should have the chance to be employed for a reasonable length of time as part of the training. Again, we wished to be judged by our ability not by visa type.
