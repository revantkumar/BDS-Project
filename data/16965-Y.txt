This bill aims at providing talented foreign graduates with the opportunity to serve America with their unique set of abilities. A company hires an employee based on his/her talent and not looking at the citizenship. A mere place of origin issue should not prohibit the talented and gifted individuals from contributing towards this great nation, which takes pride in declaring itself as a land of opportunity.

This bill is not against local and American citizens since the companies only see talent and not the citizenship. The local people who are talented and educated will always get jobs irrespective of the immigrants. The immigrants always respect the citizens and get along with them.
