I think the OPT extension is a very good regulation. More highly educated students having more opportunity to practice what they learn at school is a golden chance for them. More importantly, if more highly educated students have opportunity working in the US thanks of OPT extension, it will make US economy better. It will offer more job opportunity for US citizens since international students who work in the US during OPT extension will increase the consumption in US. They need to buy food, housing, car, cloth, and many stuff, which will give US citizen a lot of working opportunity and increase US economy. So I highly support this regulation!!! It is a VERY GOOD regulation for USA!!!
