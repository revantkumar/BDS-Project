Due to the expertise of foreign students, such as Technical skills, Coding skills, Medical skills, those skills help a lot American companies' business. Because of that, these companies need these people stay in U.S. For now, 12 months is clearly not enough for students transfer from student visa to work visa. Because for now, only 50% work visa applicants could have the chance to get work visa every year.

Also American economy is now growing, so I don't think longer OPT time for the foreign students would hurt native American's work opportunities. They are clearly much easier than us to find a job. For those students who could find a job in U.S., this already means the companies need these special people. 

As all the reasons that I listed above, I sincerely hope this new rule could be approved. I also hope native american could be more generous to accept those students. We are not causing the problems. We are improving the overall economy.
