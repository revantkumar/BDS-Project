Neethi Mohanan Nair I think the extension to the OPT period will help the students who spent time in their OPT to learn new skills pertaining to their job at the company.Also,the companies who have invested time and money to provide training for students working with them for OPT will benefit too because they will get a chance to keep these trained employees.
The extension will benefit all.
