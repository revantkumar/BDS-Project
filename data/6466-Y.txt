There is no strong evidence to oppose this policy I mean, even though I can't see obvious benefit for citizens. Anyways, "USA" is a noun that stands for "multi-cultural" and "universal reception", this is what defines us and what makes us achieve what we have today. Foreigners might tend to be more favorable in Tech companies, but they should not be excuses for us to become lazy,it's just like "Asians are good at Math" isn't an excuse for us to fail the Math classes. In fact, I even think they are what makes us more competitive since there is the difference in culture, in education and in motives, so they inspire me a lot. I think people who are strongly against this policy just shows they are afraid of competence.
