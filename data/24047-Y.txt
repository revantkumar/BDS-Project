The rule is beneficial for all parties. United States was and still is the most attractive country for talented people all around the world. It is one of the most important factors why US is the most advanced country on the planet in fields including physics, chemistry, computer science and more. The rule encourages STEM students to work in US and make their contribution to this country in those fields.

People who against this rule argue STEM students may put downward pressure on US workers. They miss the point that the rule is limited to STEM students only. Most of the employers who would recruit these students are tech companies. The tech companies are so eager for recruiting that I don't even know any student, US citizen or not, who major in STEM major but has trouble on getting a job. This is a job market where jobs are much more than the qualified applicants.

What the points of educating these foreign students, if they are forced to go back to their own countries after they received degrees and became qualified engineers and scientists? Universities in the United States are built for educating talented people to build better tomorrow here in the United States, not in other parts of the world.
