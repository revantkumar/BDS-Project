Students who pursue STEM degree do not steal job opportunities which belong to american people. They just do the job which usa do not have enough people to do! Actually there is not that many american to study computer science. That Industry like art and finance are full of americans and do not like to hire international students can prove my argument. I strongly support the extension of OPT.
