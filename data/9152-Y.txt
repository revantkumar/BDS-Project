I would like to support to extend the OPT period by 24 months for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees for the reasons below:
1. All students with STEM degrees are professional and excellent talents who are much wanted for US to continue building its leadiing position in the high tech world;
2. These students would bring different culture from their home countries which will help to create a more diversified US high tech society;
3. In China, we always welcome people who love China and want to contribute to our society with their knowledge and wisdom.
