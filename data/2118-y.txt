Gleb Bahmutov I am a former international PhD student (computer science, Purdue University), who is now an American citizen, with experience in small startups, medium-size companies and large premier scientific computing corporations. Having Optional practical training program is crucial to getting real world experience for a student and for building direct ties to United States economy. The program allows to tap into the trained professionals resource right here, in the States. There is no language or education barrier, or even "way things are done here" mis understandings. Let us keep and even expand this program - we invested our tax dollars educating them, let us get the benefit too.

I also do not consider "the international students are taking our jobs" opinion as having any merit. In these disciplines, each bright individual can create its own position, or even open an avenue for multiple jobs by working hard.
