Jim Wang I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for F1 STEM students.
First, STEM is important for the development of our everyday life. STEM students all make their own contribution for better improvement of America technology and sciences. Just like a lot of American universities admit international students, we should also allow them to have an opportunity to work, to make more contribution to America.
Second, It is the immigrants and the openness to all the people in the world that make US the strongest country in the world. It is insane for US to shut its door and reject foreign students and workers. If US starts to close its door for so called protection, I believe US will be exceeded by China, Russia and India sooner or later.
Third, just as the theory of economy, more competition is always better than monopoly, isn't it?
