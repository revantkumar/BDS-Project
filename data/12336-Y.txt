I strongly support the extension for the following reasons:
1. Denying highly trained foreign nationals the right to work in their specifically trained field will strongly decrease the US resource in technology industry, wasting the educational resources allocated to these people. 
2. At the modern age of international cooperation, the extension will help attract talents to stay in the US, rather than leaving for a country with more favorable policies such as China, India, or EU countries. In the short run, cancelling the extension may create jobs for US nationals, but in the long run, this will unavoidably decrease the international competitiveness of US.
3. Last but definitely not the least, US claims to be the land of the free and the home of the brave. I do not see how it lives up to the extend of this promise by denying enthusiastic and capable people the right to work, for a very limited period of time, at a place that they receive their education (which they paid dearly for). This will only show the exclusion and cowardice of America.
