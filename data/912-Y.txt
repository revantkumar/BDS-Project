OPT extension for STEM won't hurt the employment of other majors/industries. First, the law requires that during OPT and OPT extension, the jobs of the students must be relevant to their majors. Second, students from STEM majors do not have the skills to do jobs in accounting, arts, finances or others. And employers will definitely prefer students from relevant majors to un-relevant majors . Third, most students from STEM do not want to do jobs that are not relevant --- because of their interest.
