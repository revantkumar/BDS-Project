I totally support the new STEM OPT extension ruling. I believe the extension will help the students to gain a valuable experience which can help them to achieve the goals they had set in their lives. America has been providing an excellent platform to aspiring students from all over the world and I believe the very core of this nation is built on this very quality where it provides everyone with an opportunity to excel in life. This extension is one of those many steps taken by the american government which will help the international students gain a global exposure and hence the confidence to excel in life.
