I strongly SUPPORT this new proposed regulation. As a QA manager myself. My team consists of past foreign students from Canada, France, India and China, as well as US citizens. From my experience, my teams is benefit from the big diversity of culture and background of the team member. And all these provided the team a huge vitality. As my company, Tesla, was founded by a past F1 student and now become one of the most innovative companies of the whole world. The competition does exist between foreigners and US citizens. But it is such positive competition that made US the place that has the most and highest quality of technology talent. It also made the US be the capital of science and technology of the whole world. The more foreign talent we try to absorb. The stronger out technology will be. So please do our best to make this happen.
