I strongly support this new regulation.

Nowadays, lots of engineers in the US top tech companies are nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. They are contributing and will continue contributing their efforts to make US grow better and stronger in the field of STEM. These top tech companies are also improving the economy of US and will definitely bring more job openings to all US citizens.
