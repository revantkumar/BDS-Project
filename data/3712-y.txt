Rurun Wang I strongly support the STEM OPT extension for the following reasons. First of all, in the field of STEM, the projects usually take more than a year to accomplish. With the OPT extension, people would be able to finish their intern project and prove their ability and contribute to the company more. It is good for both the employee and the employer. Secondly, as technology plays a more and more important role in improving our life, there is an increasing market, such as digital human health, data-driven business, etc, which require a lot more STEM field students to initiate and develop.
