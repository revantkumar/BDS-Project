This is a great policy. First, students from other countries have contributed a lot to US universities's finances, they pay more than local students, not to mention contribute to the diverse of US universities. This policy will attract more and more students. Second, many of these students are elites and they have skills that many high tech companies like google, facebook need, this policy will benefit the high tech companies as well as US. Third, 12 months is too short, these students may only have one chance to get their H1B, many of them have to leave US, this is unreasonable. In total, I strongly support this new OPT policy.
