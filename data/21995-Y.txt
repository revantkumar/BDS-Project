This change to the existing OPT rules is a welcome step in making the US universities competitive. A lot of international students prefer US universities because of the OPT status which allows them to get necessary training in there respective fields. The also contribute towards US economy by paying fees, taxes etc and since a minimum wage standard has to be maintained by the employers, they are not some cheap labours stealing away jobs of US nationals. The earlier problems of cap gap faced by such students are also taken care of which is again a very positive step.
