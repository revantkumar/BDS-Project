This is the reason why I hate Indians they think they are so brilliant in faking resumes, cheating in exams and now they even fake my comment by posting another comment blindly supporting the DHS OPT extension rule. You guys are so fools they can trace back to where exactly the comments came from. Atleast you could have fixed your grammatical errors before posting. Whoever has done this, you're a big fool!!
