STEM students, who get US education and back to their countries, will be a big loss to US development. STEM majors are the basis of US economy. The technical development will support US business. The main STEM major students are international students. If US holding these students, the business and economy will have promise to be better. Moreover, with 12+24 months OPT, STEM students are all temporary employment, this policy will not affect the native US citizen's employment condition to be worse. Instead of 12+19 months, STEM students will spend more money in their life expenses, like rent. It cannot deny that these kind of consumptions will motivate US economy.
