Keeping foreign talents in the United States is important for two reasons. 

First of all, people who graduated from top Universities with STEM degrees are the ones that are the economy running. They work from tech start up in California to bio labs in Boston. They contribute positively to tax and to technology advancements. 

Secondly, United States is what it is today because of immigration. Students with STEM degrees demonstrated that they are smart enough and they work hard to stay in the country to pursue their dreams. They should be given the chance to do so.
