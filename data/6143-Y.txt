Sin Lee I would back the new rules because the U.S would benefit from it most. No one wants those who have been studying in our country to serve other countries after graduation. What we need to do it to make them stay, not to drive them away. Now China has made tons of policies to attract those foreign students, those who are opposing this proposal might be payed and controlled by the Chinese government.
