Alex Shu I strongly agree with the action of 24 month OPT and Cap-Gap relief. First, international student working in STEM area will benefit our economy. Every STEM area job will create 3 jobs in support area. Secondly, the longer training period after school will provide students for better training in their studying field. This will improve the quality of our education system. Third, while all the talent students are staying here for longer time, their will have more chance to start up their bossiness here or use their technology to improve our industry and economy. In all, the new OPT policy will benefit the US economy and I strongly favor of it.
