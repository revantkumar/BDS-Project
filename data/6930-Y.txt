I strongly urge the US government and court to approve this proposal based on following considerations. First, the American is always an immigration country that accept everyone who comes from other county if he/she is will to work and contribute to this country. Second, it's very important for the United State to keep competitive advance in technology and science in nowadays and future. The stem students or workers are an crucial force for that goal. The opt extension for stem students and works is an relative and wise way to gain the advance to other country, just like it used to be. Third, the high tech immigrations who always have better educated background can keep the socity more safe and harmonic. They will benefit the community, since they woke hard and contribute more. 
Based on these concerns I strongly hope the United State government and people could say "yes" to this proposal. We will have a better mutual future together, the American people and the immigrations they accepted. 
sincerely,
Zhengbang
