I fully support an extension on the issue matter.

As the department head I am responsible for recruitment. The limitation on OPT has forced us to drop several extremely talented international candidates as their OPT is expiring or not long enough to cover the time before we file an H1B petition for them. 

It has been greatly unfortunate that we miss this talents and spend time and effort to find replacements for this human capital again.
