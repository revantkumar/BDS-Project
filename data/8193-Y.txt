The regulation of OPT extension for STEM students is not only good for students but also good for the companies and US economy. If the regulation failed to pass, hundreds of thousands of students on OPT will have to be deported from US, which would be a disaster to our economic system. Currently, in most of the high tech companies, STEM students play the most important roles in the daily operation which cannot be handled by others. Fail to keep those stem students will cause Us to loss billions of money each year and many company will be close. I strongly agree to pass this regulation!
