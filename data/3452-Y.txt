I strongly support the idea of extending OPT for STEM students, not only for the benefit of individuals, but also for the benefit of American society generally.

We travel long way from home to study at the United States, we sacrifice a lot, so please at least give us equal opportunity to use the knowledge we learned to give back to the American society. We are here not asking for more compensations, but for more time to let us see what we can do in the industry.

In addition, people from different culture background can make design more diverse, we may see one problem in another perspective, that will help the product to be not only sold in the United States, but also at a global scale.

What's more, more labors in the industry can speed up the development cycle, which will improve the efficiency and productivity. This will lead to economical boost of the company and American economy as a whole.

Most importantly, people tend to talk and learn from each other when they come from different cultures because of curiosity, this will make working environment more accord and interesting, in the end, making American society more open and comprehensive.
