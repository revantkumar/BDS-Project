Optional Practical Training (OPT) DHS Docket No. ICEB-2015-0002
There are many reasons not to expand this rule. 
1.There are already around 668,000 students in this program, giving employers reasons to hire these people rather than American citizens. Isn't this enough?
2. These people do not pay FICA taxes and this hurts Social Security. This should certainly be a red flag.
3. In March of 2014 the GAO already found full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud and not adequately overseen. Why expand this?
4. The rule requires organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.
5. If we really "need" foreign students because of a STEM shortage, why do we need to train them? This doesn't make sense and point to discrimination against American citizens.
In summary, this program appears to be in disarray already, gives employers a tremendous incentive to hire only foreign workers at the expense of American ciizens, and this rule should not be adopted.
