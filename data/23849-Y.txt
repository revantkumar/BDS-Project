YES, STEM OPT should be extended to 24 months, but why ? One of the reasons why the U.S. is a powerful country is its diverse population and crucial contribution of its immigrant population to science, engineering and technology. Extension of 17 months of STEM OPT to 24 months is a win-win situation both for the U.S. and the international students studying in this great country. If the STEM OPT is not extended to 24 months, and even worse, if it will become less than 17 months, the U.S. will not be able to attract international students, or it will attract significantly less international students. Thus, there will be a significant decrease in number of students in the U.S. universities and the U.S. will experience the lack of qualified employees in science, engineering and technology related areas.
