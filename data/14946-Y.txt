Teach them, spend money on them and send them to competing economy does not make sense. Lets teach them, keep them and offer them a path to citizenship because not only do they help the economy, but they also create jobs to fellow American STEM graduates. I myself got hired on opt and in the same department, three Americans were hired too so I did not take their job opportunities, but the demand is too high to be fulfilled using just American talent. 
Please keep the American Dream Alive.
