I think it is great, because most American don't major in STEM, and America universities spent time and resources on international students. It would seem to be a huge waste to just chase scientists back to their own country without allowing them to contribute for two years. 

I am a UC Irvine student, and half of my programming classmates are international students. If they all leave here once they graduate, it would be hard for me to see what American can gain from that.

Also 35% of international students are in STEM fields, and 45% of foreign student graduates extend their visas to work in the same metropolitan area as their college or university
