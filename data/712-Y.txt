Rahul Verma Having an extension for OPT will help both student and country to retain there advanced learning useful, Student can work in real time environment and can attain professional experience which will be useful for developing the more advance technology. 
Student gaining knowledge in USA and then not able to apply those here is a loss to country. 

My vote is for The support of OPT extension
