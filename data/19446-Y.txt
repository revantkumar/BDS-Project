It is ridiculous that some people feel the international STEM students are occupying the positions that should have been taken by American citizens. I admit that there are some American citizens who fail to get their dream jobs. But that's simply because they are not skilled and hence do not reach the hire bar. Companies, especially those high-end tech companies, pay high salary to the employers, expecting them to completing tasks effectively and efficiently. Their goal is to make profit! Why do they bother to hire those who take the high salary but cannot do the job well? I sincerely suggest them to do more reflections on themselves instead of finding excuses for their failures.

Undoubtedly, STEM students have been taking important roles in high-end industry, making great contributions to the development of this country. I strongly suggest to expand OPT extension for STEM students.
