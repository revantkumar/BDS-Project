I am against expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. American workers were denied more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013. This is not fair for our American workers. OPT removed $4 billion from Social Security and Medicare trust funds. Also employers get around H-1 B Cap. Employers save 7.65% when they hire foreign students instead of U.S. Workers. They do not pay FICA or Medicare taxes.
