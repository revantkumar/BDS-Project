Mehmet Tuna Sakallioglu I fully support the OPT extension rule. It helps the U.S keeps its competitive edge among other countries. It is also one of the reasons people chose to educate in the U.S rather then other countries. Thus it is a mutual benefit for both the country and the people that believe in the education standards of the U.S schools. If this rule fails to get through, many people working and trying to build their future will have to leave the country which will not only affect those people but also the companies that they work for.
