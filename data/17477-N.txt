Please ask your Population Scientists, isn't true that Too many American Citizens are unemployed and are forced to compete with foreign and illegal resident workers.
Please help US Citizens gain fair jobs. Make E-Verify mandatory. Those that hire illegal immigrants (that have been here less than 10 or so years) should be in jail.
Please allow American Citizens to do All the work that is currently being done by undocumented "immigrants".
American Citizens will do ALL the work currently being done by immigrants when wages are fair and working conditions and housing conditions are decent.
This has nothing to do with race, ethnics or national origin. It is about the massive numbers. 
Ask your Population Scientists.
Best wishes to all,
Greg
