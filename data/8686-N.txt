You've got to be kidding! This is not improving, it's a gift to businesses that want to cut costs and it's at the expense of American citizens. I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. It's hard to believe that our government even considers such proposals. You are so out of touch! I am a technology worker and this goes against everything we Americans believe in - Capitalism - free and fair supply and demand principles. This would give incentives to companies to hire foreign students over OUR OWN CITIZENS!

Let's do this JUST for government jobs. Maybe then you could see the light.
