I strongly support this rule. Foreign students come to America because they believe America is a land of freedom and equality. They believe they will be given the equal opportunity to prove their talents here.OPT extension is definitely a great chance to show that America is indeed a country that we believe it should be. 

Also having foreigners work in America is a win-win for both foreign students and America's economy.America's continuous development needs talents'contributions. Canceling the OPT extension, on the one hand, will decrease the foreign students' chances of getting H1B and contributing to this country , on the other hand,will make America a much less attractive county for seeking education.
