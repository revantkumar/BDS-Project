It is obvious that the OPT STEM policy will benefit US. The international students is not a threatening factor in the job market, since the local companies prefer citizens if another similar applicants are international. However, in the STEM fields, the companies still need to employ a lot of international graduates because it's difficult for them to find a citizen who achieve same level of the advanced degree and skills. Only very small amount of American students would like to pursue advanced STEM major, even the government and universities gave a lot of treaties to encourage them. That means the international graduates didn't take the jobs away from local people, actually, they fill into a blank space of the job market. US industry will experience a long awkward period if this OPT extension is canceled, and can't afford the loss accompanied with.
