2 eamples of why more high tech worker visas are bad for the average american worker. First my cousin knows a guy whos recently graduated as an elictrical engineer and cant find a job. Second I know an older couple who in turn have a neighbor from India whos a software engineer working here in Illinois for some company. They pay this Indian software engineer wages he would earn if he were still living in India. Its like $2500 dollars a year they pay him . The company must subsidize his housing and car. But his salary is what it would be if he lived in India. The couple I know said when they spoke to this Indian software engineer that he said he " feels like a slave and needs to get out of that deal." American CEO's only care for themselves and if given an opportunity to fire every american worker and import slaves or indentured servants from, india, china, mexico etc etc. THEY WOULD DO IT IN A HEARTBEAT! Either import cheap labor or sneak free trade deals through congress that the public is not allowed to see because they know American workers are about to get slaughtered with this asian trade pact but their so greedy they dont care and will bribe every ambulance chasing congrssman, senator, president and judge to get what they want. Which always and really only involves increasing profits for themselves.
