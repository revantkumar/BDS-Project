OPT is good because only the top international students are retained. The vast majority of them cannot get jobs due to various restrictions and challenges, and end up going home after graduation. OPT is NOT forcing Americans out of jobs. They have to go through the exact same interview process. Getting employed is not easier for them, it's only harder for them, because employers are reluctant to hire them due to expensive fees associated with sponsoring them. This new rule also strengthens protection for American workers, so this new rule is undoubtedly good for America's future, and we should all support it.
