Support this new rule.

1. Foreign students with OPT will not take up the work opportunities for Americans because US Citizen and Green Card Holders are extremely preferred by employers over foreign students. In career fare of my university there are one third of the companies will hire foreign students. Even within the companies who allow foreign students to work there prefer US Citizen and Green Card since they dont need extra cost on visa sponsorship 

2. If Abandoning the OPT Expansion, American are driving away students work in scientific and technology just like German drove away Jewish People including the famous scientist like Albert Einstein and Lise Meitner. I am not sure how long will it be when The United States be the leader of high technical industry.
