I strongly support this proposal of expanding the OPT extension to 24 months. It is the truth that skilled foreigners have made huge contribution to the science research and technology innovation which has benefit this country, all the Americans living in this country, and even the whole world in a great deal. It can't be denied that the importance of what those highly trained foreigners, especially the international students in STEM majors, have brought to the US academia and industries, which greatly helps build a strong economy for every AMERICAN's better life. The longer OPT extension would definitely enhance such skilled workforce's motivation to work hard for the American companies to create more jobs and opportunities, which is benefiting all American families too!
