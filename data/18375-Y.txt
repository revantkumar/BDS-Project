I strongly support 24 month OPT extension for the following reasons:
1. Students who get OPT extensions are highly educated and intelligent. They are potentially great talents for society. The fact that they are able to find fitting jobs is solid proof that their talents are needed. Excluding them due to policy reasons is just unreasonable.

2. Everyone should have equal chances based on their ability not race or sex. This is deeply rooted in the American spirit and shouldn't be forgotten due to short-visioned job market competition. If you are truly exceptional, you don't need to feel threatened. The argument of "leaving jobs for americans" is just an excuse for being afraid that you are not good enough. 

3. A 24 month OPT extension would encourage more people globally to pursue higher education, breeding more talents. 

4. No matter who you are, if you are working for an IT company in US, you are making contributions to US economy. Huge amount of work force in IT company are affected by this rule. Imagine the lag or even regression in economy when IT companies begins to worry about policies instead of making better products. If you keep wanting new electronics, better internet service, why would you deprive those companies of having the right people ? 

If you are carefully reading this and thinking about it. Thank you!
