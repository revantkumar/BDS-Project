I support the proposal. I read most of the negative comments and think most of them are misleading. 
Actually, the students who benefit from STEM OPT are not cheap labors. It is the talents' contribution that leads and pushes the technology development of U.S. Hiring the STEM students will NOT hurt the job opportunities for Americans, because few Americans are in the high-tech area. Forcing these students back to their country only makes U.S. lose power in high-tech arena but gives the competitors more chances.
