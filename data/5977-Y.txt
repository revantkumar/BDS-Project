Ben Owens I appose the F-1 and STEM programs. Americans do not get any free treatment. Every body that works in this Country should work and pay taxes like every body else. Take care of your own. Why dose a foreigner get specule treatment? Programs like these flat screw the tax payer and slaps hard working AMERICANS in the face. For years I have had Mexicans laugh in my face on how they work the system getting everything free and avoiding paying taxes. It is time to hold everybody to our standards, compete for jobs and pay taxes. Quit kissing everybodies ass and being unfair to AMERICANS. STOP.
