Hi all,

I'm a F-1 visa holder in my opt extension.

I think it's a win-win situation here for all.The OPT extension for STEM students allow students to practice their skills, create wealth for society with very little trade off from people live in US.
In fact, few more years later, when people from baby boom retired, US will need lots of young blood to maintain their system. Who will help then? 
We, the F-1 student would love to help, but without a friendly visa policy, it's hard for us to find out what we can do for this society.

Have to finish right here, have works to do.
Thank you.
