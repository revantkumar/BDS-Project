I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
First, intellectuals should be respected all over the world. We've contributed a lot to the development of the science, technology and economy of the American society and deserve the rights to choose to stay and work here.
Second, America has always been a place open to people and the society itself is founded on the basis of immigrations. It's the accepting of elite international people no matter who they are and where they are from that made the achievements of the prosperity of today's society.
Third, although a lot of technicians here would occupy many work positions, they contribute a lot to the development of the economy and actually would create more positions for the society.
