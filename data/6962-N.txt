My son is a Electrical Engineering student at Cal Poly, SLO. We have spent over $100,000 on his education so far. We have spent money on his education in this difficult field, so that he will be able to find work and get a good job and support himself and his family after he graduates from college. Our American sons and daughters need the STEM jobs, not people from other countries! My parents generation built these universities for their kids and their grandkids. Let's let the graduates have good jobs in this country!

By turning the F-1 student visas into 3-year work visas, DHS is doing an end run around Congressional limits on H-1b 3-year work visas.

There are already over 125,000 workers in OPT programs and over a half million potential foreign workers with F-1 visas, yet Americans who graduate are finding a stagnant job market in STEM fields.

Big Tech lobbyists have spent over $1 billion seeking immigration increases, but Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard are laying off tens of thousands of employees.

I am opposed to the proposed OPT expansion.

Thank you
