Ata ur rahman Mohammed The rule for extending stem opt rule to 24 months from 17 months will give fair chance for applying H1B to students graduating in any semester, with 17 month rule students graduating in spring will only get 2 chances while students graduating in fall will get total of 3 chances. This is the reason I "Strongly Support" the stem extension to 24 months. It will give students a little more flexibility in planning their studies.
