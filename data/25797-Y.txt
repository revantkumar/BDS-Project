I strongly support the proposal for Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students.

The reasons are simple, but decisive:

1, Given more years, the students who have received high-quality level STEM education in US would have more chances to make contributions to the growth of science and technology of US.

2, The F-1 students really do not affect the US citizens working opportunities. actually, only the companies who cannot find appropriate candidates among US citizens would love to spend more money to sponsor F-1 students.
