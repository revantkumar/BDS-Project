I strongly support this rule for the following reasons.

1. IT companies have hired many talented foreign engineers who is opt. And they contribute to this country a lot.

2. One of the most important spirit of america is diversity. I am a foreigner and this is why I came here to learn. If america loses diversity, it will be no longer the most successful country in the world.

3. STEM project does not make native americans lose their jobs. It is about competition. It makes americans study harder in order to get a better job. It is a good thing for america's education. Since there is so many foreigner's studying science in america, the america became the super power of the world.
