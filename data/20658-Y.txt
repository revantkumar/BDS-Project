I strongly support this new policy. The foreign students can be very helpful to the development of the technology fields, and the development of technology companies would produce more and more jobs, which could make people who cannot get such good jobs now really get one in the future. Sequentially, the competition intensity of the jobs these people used to have will reduce, so on and on. Finally everybody can get a better job! People say that technology is the best productive force, and this is exactly what it means - everyone gets andbetter job and lives a better life! And the pace will be faster with foreign students.
