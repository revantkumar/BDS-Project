I oppose the expansion of OPT or any other visa extensions for foreign students. I oppose all of Obama's job killing programs. I find it contradictory for Obama to favor government mandated minimum wage characteristic of a control economy. It takes a particularly uneducated, even irrational mind to conceive of raising the price of a commodity without concomitantly reducing the demand, then introducing replacement workers not burdened by that minimum wage requirement to reduce even the further the demand for American workers. I find unavoidable the maxim that if the results of a program are predictable, those results are intentional. Defeat Obama's program to keep American technical workers unemployed and dependent upon his socialist government. OPT is another step by Obama in crushing the American economy.
