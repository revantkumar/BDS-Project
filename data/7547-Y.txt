Tianquan Wei Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,

It's pleasure to have this chance to make comments on this new OPT extension.

OPT extension will be definitely contribute to US. Living expense of OPT student is a large promotion of domestic consumption including daily necessities, eating, renting, traveling and education, etc. And the need in these industries will create more job opportunities for local people. According to Association of International Educators, international student contribute more than $26 billion to US economy. So OPT extension is good to US.

Recent year, the US economy recovers from the crisis in 2008 and more and more hi-tech company start recruiting more employee to enlarge the business. There will be huge gap between in hi-tech job opportunities and talents major in that area if there is no OPT extension. If that's the case, the US economy will face another bad impact on the road of recovery.

According to above two points, I think it's necessary to approve OPT extension.

Sincerely,
Tianquan
