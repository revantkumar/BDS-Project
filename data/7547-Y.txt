I think this is a good idea. Giving international students a better chance to contribute to America with what they learned in school is very important, since they really take a heavy percentage in those science and technology fields where OPT STEM apply. Those fields play important roles in economy growth and life improvement. Also the developing of those fields will also expand job market and better solve employment problems. OPT STEM project will increase the diversity in America. Diversity is not a bad thing for Americans, because this is what makes America strong. Besides, I don't think there exist intense competitions between citizens and foreigners in the STEM fields, since most of the students in these majors are international students. And if a citizen and a foreigner with equal level of technology skills compete for the same job position, the citizen will get it in most cases.
So if a project will make improvements to both technology and economy and meanwhile encourage more skillful and highly educated people to work in America, why not go for it?
