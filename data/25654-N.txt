Almost everytime I read or view an artcle or report from an author about how our young people, college graduates, and "trade School" graduates, citizens of our nation all, are suffering due to debt and unemployment, there are those who simply say, "Just Get A Job". As many of these young people, some with children, are forced to ask for government assistance in such ways as SNAP Benefits, Housing Benefits, and other forms of assistance in order to survive, they are still being told the same old idea, "Just get a Job". Often times the jobs they could get aren't jobs they received training for when they have to compete with others who are offered "Special Training" and then get those jobs for less pay and/or no benefits, and/or "Special" tax reductions that only benefits the corporations that hire them. Our very own citizens become non-competive in this picture because all the benefits go to the corporation that hires those with "Special Training". 
Making our own citizen "Graduates" non-competive is what leads to the idea that we have a shortage of those who are trained for the fields that corporations desire. "Special Training" adds to that idea in that those who don't get that training are unemployable because they don't get it. So, "Just get a job" means nothing when there is no "Equal" competition.
