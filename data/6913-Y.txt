Larry Liu I strongly strongly support this extension!

The graduates will stay or not, with this longer extension, it benefits not just the graduates, but also this country, which is not necessary for me to repeat here.

And this land doesn't not belong to anybody but all the human kinds and those who have the wills and also skills to stay with for this land, and build this land to the benefits of human kinds. Don't say it is yours please.

This land needs all people, and especially needs those talents developed here in the educational institutions to build it with longer time. 

Therefore I, who live here, strongly, strongly, and strongly, support this extension!
