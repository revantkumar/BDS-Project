Why are we, as American citizens, allowing our Representatives to dismantle America by replacing American workers for foreign workers, American language with translations, American culture with foreign culture, our Christianity beliefs with a religion that hates the Western World, dismantling of The Constitution and even considering Sharia Law, rewarding illegal immigration with Amnesty, replacing Truth with lies, and being "Politically Correct" in the face of America's Dream becoming extinct for Americans?

This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's difficult already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.
