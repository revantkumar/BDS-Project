By the Dept of homeland security expanding the OPT program they are favoring foreign citizens over American citizens. We have young qualified American college graduates that can't find jobs in the Tech industry because the US Chamber of Commerce and Corporations with the help of the US government want cheap labor. By extending H-1B visas to 3 years the employers avoid paying payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare. They also get incentives to hire foreign workers. We have many bright talented Americans who need these jobs. With so many American workers out of jobs what is the rational for this except crony capitalism and greed. We don't need any more fiascos like Disney laying off qualified tech workers and making them train their foreign counterparts. We must save American jobs for American citizens
