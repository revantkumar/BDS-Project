I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

First, the proposal guarantee the safeguards for U.S. Workers in Related Fields. To guard against adverse effects on U.S. workers, this proposal would require terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity (including duties, hours, and compensation) to be commensurate with those applicable to similarly situated U.S. workers. In addition to requiring a related attestation in the Mentoring and Training Plan, an employer would also be required to attest that: 
(1) The employer has sufficient resources and trained personnel available to provide appropriate mentoring and training in connection with the specified opportunity; 
(2) the employer will not terminate, lay off, or furlough any full- or part-time, temporary or permanent U.S. workers as a result of providing the STEM OPT to the student; and 
(3) the student's opportunity assists the student in attaining his or her training objectives.

Second, diversity is very important to a great country. Throughout history, there are many scientists who have made great contributions to America, and the world. Nowadays, the proportion of professors from foreign countries is increasing and many PHD students are international students in STEM programs. They enjoy the advantage of high level research environment and are supported by research funding. It's time for them to make contributions to America.
