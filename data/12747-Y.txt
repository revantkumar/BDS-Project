America's inclusiveness is one of the very reason that attracts me to pursue my master degree here. I believe a large part of international students are similar with me, who coming to America because of the future dream job. These job opportunities will have barely affect in native employment rate, but will bring America a great chance to absorb more talents, develop new area of technology, and to build a better community.
The situations today is that, a large part of engineering students are international students, while most students in bussiness school are native students. It would be a great pity if these engineers have difficulties more than enough to contribute their skills to old or new companies in America, and also would bring a hard time for bussiness people to get their dreams started.
OPT is a reason of great importance when considering about studying in America. I belive in 100% that its extension will appeal to more talented people to come to America and contribute themselves after their graduation. On the other hand, this will create more job opportunities, and form a virtuous cycle.
This generation of youths, at least for Chinese, is the best so far. I think it is not wise to close the door to them (us) by a wrong policy of OPT.
Please consider carefully as you will.
Thank you.
