I strongly support this proposal. I believe improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 students will hugely benefit United States. 
As a former scientist trained in biomedical research field, it is very obvious to me that training a STEM student requires a huge amount of education and research funding. The funding is limited especially in the past several years. Yet the academia is striving to put the money to training STEM students. If STEM students, after being trained in the US institutions, don't have chance to work for a sufficiently long period of time in US, all the funding and resources spent for the training basically are gone. In other words, improving and expanding OPT for stem is a process to get return from all the investment put into STEM students. Therefore, it is hurting the interest of the US and all the taxpayers if STEM students have to leave US to seek for job abroad.
In addition, expanding OPT will give the talented STEM students an opportunity to get H1B and even green cards to stay in US to serve the country. This is why United States is the strongest country in the world - it attracts the best people from all cultures. Without expanding STEM OPT, a STEM student only has one year to file H1B visa so he or she can stay longer in the US to work for the country. However, the lottery nature of H1B means that many truly talented STEM students will not get H1B within a year and thus have to leave the country. The consequence is not just US is losing those talented people, but also those people will go back to other countries and to work and compete with US - after US put so much money into training them. Therefore, again, expanding STEM OPT would significantly benefit United States.
Finally, I believe expanding STEM OPT training will NOT affect US citizens in terms of job opportunities. As a scientist, I would hope there are more US students majored in STEM. However, this is not the case. There are not much competition to begin with - we
