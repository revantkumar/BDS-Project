As a IT company founder, I strongly support the proposal. Below are my reasons:

1. Technical students resource is very intense. Most of them have dreams to company like Apple and Google, which makes a small start-up business like mine has some trouble with hiring sometimes. However international students who can provide higher technology are willing to join us. It does help a lot. And we also treat them as usual employee to offer them average salary or even higher.

2. International students make some great contribution, not only to our economic development, but also to our country innovation.

3. They learned knowledge from U.S. universities, they should be allowed to contribute to our country as well.
