I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Diversity is one of the most important and respectful factors that U.S. stands as a Free country. Everyone is born to be equal. To extend OPT for STEM is helpful to have more different international students, which makes U.S. diversified. All of these international students will share their cultures and knowledge to make U.S. better.

2. Most international students learn knowledge and improve a lot when they study at U.S. To extend OPT for STEM makes them a better chance and a longer time to contribute back to the U.S. society. In the history, many outstanding people were international students at U.S. and they made huge contributions to the U.S. society.

3. Competition does exists, but this is not a bad thing. Most international students work as scientists or engineers in the high-tech companies to build something make the world better and make U.S. company more competitive in the world. They are not competing with U.S. citizens because the demand in this area is very huge.

International students are helping America grow, and are improving the welfare of American people. Losing them, on the other hand, will benefit our competitors in the world. I strongly believe we should pass this proposal and pass more bills in the congress that could make it easier for the international students to stay.
