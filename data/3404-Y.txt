Governments and universities invested a lot money providing scholarships, assistantships and other resources to F1 students, especially for those with STEM majors. We shouldn't just let them go away without capitalizing our investments. 
I see the OPT extension a good way to maintain those STEM students, giving them a chance to produce and contribute to US economy with their specialties.
