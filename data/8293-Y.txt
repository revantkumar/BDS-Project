I think this is a win-win strategy, I strongly support this proposal and the reasons are shown as below.

First, more international workers means tech companies have enough employees to work for them, which brings more profit for these tech companies so that more tax revenue is created. Government can utilize tax revenue to improve American people's quality of life.

In addition, international students with stem degrees will not compete with American citizens. Tech company always have more interest in American citizen rather than international students. So, international students just fill in the void caused by the lack of qualified workers. International students with OPT can not work in other industries and they will get deported if they tried to do so.
