Robert Rinehuls I oppose legislation to extend the time foreign students may stay in this country. This is being sought by corporations as an attempt to thwart H-1B regulations, and to enable them to employ persons in student status, thereby saving them money. It also decreases the number or job opportunities for American citizens seeking those jobs.
