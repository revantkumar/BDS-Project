I definitely support this. And for people who say the foreigners are stealing their jobs, please do some research first before you jump to such conclusion. Companies like Google hire them because they are more skilled, even if that means they have to pay more to keep those foreign workers. So, stop blaming it on foreigners. Work hard and make yourself better. Honestly, with this economy, Americans need this kind of push to work harder.
