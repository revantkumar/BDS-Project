I came to US 5 years ago and now I'm a US citizen. I strongly support the proposed rule of improving and expanding training opportunities for F1 Nonimmigrant students with STEM degree. As far as I know, the students are helping us moving the society forward. I think US should be open to talented people in order to maintain its leadership in the world. 

I worked in Broadcom Corp before and a lot of talented engineers are from foreign countries, such as Iran, India, Taiwan.etc. I even couldn't imagine how is Broadcom could stand without these people. If the company got bankrupted, not only the engineers but the Americans lost their job because Broadcom has a lot of US citizen employees as well. 

Even F1 students are not supposed to live in US after they are done with their training, they do make great contributions to US economy. Some people even founded their own company and create a lot of opportunities for US citizens. Like Mike Krieger, a Brazilian entrepreneur and software engineer who co-founded Instagram. 

If we cancel their OPT, we are kind of showing the world that we are not welcoming the talented people as before. This will be a disaster for our country.
