This new rule will be win-win for US economy and international STEM student. STEM students can really contribute to the technology innovation in the United States. On the other hand, with a proper 24 months rule, STEM student will be assured that they will have at least three chance to win h1b lottery. Without STEM extension, someone with great talent may not come to the United States to study, because they know that there is less than a third chance to get the H1B lottery within only 12 month opt. This will greatly impact US economy in both short term and long term. We need 24 months STEM extension.
