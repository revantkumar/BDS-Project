I do really agree with that expanding as now I am a master student of electrical and computer engineering and I came from China, I will begin to work soon after my graduation and I will begin to start my opt. We all know that American is a great city with so many great technical companies, so there is a great demand for the employee of people who have degrees in STEM. America needs us to keep the fast growing in the technical area. And for the students like mewe need more time and more changce to gain more working experience. So expanding the opt is actually a win-win strategy. I really hope this will become true. 
Thank you
