I believe extending the time allowed for foreign students to study in the US provides both parties valuable outcomes. The US benefits from the unique perspective and advanced knowledge of the student and the student learns valuable business methods and first hand experience in a first class competitive environment. Extending the time to 24 months also is more conducive to the schedule of the university system and may halt unnecessary interruptions in the students studies/research. I am whole heartedly in support of extending the length of time for OPT.
