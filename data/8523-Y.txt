I am currently working for a big engineering company. For what I observe in office, variety creates a more encouraging and respectful working environment which I think will contribute to high efficiency and productivity. And that is a mirror of the whole american society. Because of comparatively equal chances in all business, especially high-tech companies, our life become easier for everyone--don't forget those people who against this rule are also using those products like Google Maps and Iphones. Definitely they benefit from intelligent ideas and various selections.

Recognizing that we need and will continue in need of competitive environment and people who provide high technique, we might have to agree STEM extension. Known to everybody that all American need STEM degree graduates to contribute to it, 1-year OPT period is limited in time for a company to fully understand what the entry level employee could offer best and for individuals to entirely grasp the essentials what company and society in need. 

Also notice that US universities and economy are earning from international students and sometimes their wealthy relatives visiting them. If we are accepting Syria refugees and being tolerate, why we can't be tolerate to those competitive student and in a result to our own business.
