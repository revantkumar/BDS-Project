I urge the Dept. of Homeland Security to NOT give incentives to anyone to hire a foreign immigrant over a United States citizen. We must supply jobs to our Citizens who are qualified. Allowing more immigrates into our country based on their degrees, etc. is not what our country should be about. We need to take care of our own BEFORE shipping more foreigners into our country to fill the jobs our people need to support their families. We may be a country of opportunity for all.....but charity begins at home. If you want to provide an incentive PAY U.S. companies incentives to hire American Citizens. PLEASE DO NOT SUPPORT this program!
