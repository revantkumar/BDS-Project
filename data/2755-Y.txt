I strongly support this rule. It is a great benefit for both international students and the country. There will be many adverse effects if this rule doesn't come into existence and the international students have to leave the country. The US economy will be hit badly and many companies would lose good amount of resources who really worked hard to be at this position. Also, US would lose the prospective international students and many students would not be able take benefit of high education which is provided in US.They will not get the opportunity of getting an high industry level experience in US.

Therefore, I highly encourage and support for this rule to be implemented as soon as possible.
