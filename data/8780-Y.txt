I would like to ask you to really rethink your proposed act of improving and expanding training opportunities for f-1 noimmigrant students with STEM degrees and CAP-GAP relief for all eligible F-1 students. We need to hire Americans first and strongly look to our new college combat veterans for these jobs first. Thank you for your time in this matter
