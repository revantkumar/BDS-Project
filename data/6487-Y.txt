I strongly SUPPORT the OPT extension proposal. A lot of person argue that foreigners taken your jobs, the truth is foreigners are doing jobs you are not willing to do, meanwhile taking lost salary. Even if all foreigners leave this country, I do not think all these positions can be occupied by native american. There are already a lot of restrictions about OPT and it's hard to find a company willing to sponsor H1B. Business all over the world coming to America, also talented people coming to America. Only the closest societies turns their back to foreign talented person, and I do not think America is one of them.
