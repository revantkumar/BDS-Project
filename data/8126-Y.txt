I strongly support improving training opportunities for F-1 Non-immigrant students. America is the land of opportunities. It is a country of immigrants. It cannot restrict opportunities to international students and limit its on progress this way. The cap-gap relief is going to be a huge help for people who come from abroad and have to pay back huge loans in thousands of dollars because they got educated in the U.S. These people give to the U.S. economy too, they generate income and pay their taxes and help the economy thrive. The U.S. will lose out on a really large part of its work force if this rule does not pass through. It is hard enough for international students to find visa sponsorship, what with a lot of companies not even ready to file for work visas, please do not make it harder by taking away their cap-gap relief and extension period.
