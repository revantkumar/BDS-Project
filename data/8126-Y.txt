anon Winters Expanding training opportunities for F1 Nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees is not an improvement. It is, in fact, a terribly rotten idea. This is just a ploy for corrupt universities to get more students, instead of taking care of the American students, many of whom took out substantial loans to get their educations because they were told they would be able to get good jobs with those degrees. Now the Universities want to get money from foreign students and hang the American kids out to dry, with loans they will still have to pay even if they go bankrupt. There are a large number of young American Engineers, Scientists, Computer Scientists, Physicists and Mathematicians, who all went to college and got their degrees, and don't yet have jobs in their fields. You need to be restricting the number of foreign technical workers in America so that more of our own hard working kids can get jobs.
