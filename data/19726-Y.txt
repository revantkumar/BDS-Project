Docket No. ICEB-2015-0002

In my opinion it is very necessary to improve the OPT Extension to two years.

1. Students in STEM majors should be encouraged to participate in meaningful projects that can help them attain a better understanding of their major and develop the practical skills necessary to advance their careers. This is a process typically requires several years to complete. For those international students who has paid their tuition and overcome all the difficulties studying in US, it is reasonable and important for them to have OPT and OPT Extension and grow in their field of study. 

2. On the other hand, extending OPT Extension to two years can help to enhance the academic benefit of the education programs and maintain the nation's economic, scientific, and technological competitiveness, and keep attracting foreign STEM students to study in US.
