I strongly support this rule as it helps US educated STEM candidates get a fair opportunity of contributing towards US economy and reduce the shortage of employees with skill sets in STEM field in this country. It makes no sense to educate these bright students with graduate degrees in fields where businesses have large shortfall and then let them contribute towards development of other countries. Rules like these will help companies in US maintain their global competitive edge.
