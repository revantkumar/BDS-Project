It is critical for trainee in STEM to continue their OPT extension. Lots of us need the transition time to have H-1 or EB application processed. A lot of employee also relied on the OPT extension for recruiting, and we're not prepared for H-1 sponsorship. If the OPT was terminated, it would be a huge disruption for both the student and the employee. International students are already disadvantaged for seeking employment in USA because discrimination on most basis was not allowed except for nationality, and having the opt extension is going to exacerbate the situation. USA innovation needs talent from all over the world, killing talent mobility could make USA loose the leading edge.
