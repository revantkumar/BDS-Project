I strongly support this proposal for the following

1) Most of the F1 student who received full time job offer are educated, smart and competitive people who can really contribute greatly to the American economy.
2) They've worked so hard at school to get here; they will work even harder if they stay here. 
3) Young people are the future of a country. When many countries such as Japan and Germany are desperately fighting for talented young minds, there is really no reason for America to educate them and then turn them away. 

Just my opinion. 

Best regards,
Shanjun Liao
