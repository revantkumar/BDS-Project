No nonsense. As a U.S. citizen. I am opposed to this new policy, seriously.
For now, our country, our people are facing a crisis that most of you are still unaware of. Our opportunity, technology, social and natural resources are stolen by those Asians, Latino, Indians, both immigrants and nonimmigrants. Some core-spirits of our country which were created by the Fathers are rotten by those foreigners. Our world-wide leadership is brutally offended by those countries who export such students. All we need to do is to form or legislate to limit the rights of these students. It is not too late to do it, while if do not, we will have no chance to regret.
