As an international student, I strongly support this proposal. It is fair that everyone has chance to compete for jobs, especially international students. What companies need is a ideal person who will make a difference and profit. During OPT, international students will get more valuable experience which is also a excellent opportunity for companies to select proper person for the job. A little more competition will bring efficiency and benefit to companies. There is a lot of jobs needed talented people including US citizens and international students. With the extension of OPT, talented students all around the globe can offer their energy and ideas, which will absolutely bring prosperity to US industry and economy.
