The reason to reject it is that the STEM students threaten the job opportunities of native students. The point is if this is true? I don't know the exact number of how many STEM students working in U.S. and how many native STEM students are losing job. Just look around, if the native STEM students, if there are any, are unemployed? The fact is that all the native STEM students around me find their positions. 
For individual, job positions result from the developments of science and technology. How much STEM students contribute to this country and how many job opportunities they crate directly or indirectly? How much this country loses without them? Is the number of STEM people enough to support the science and technology in this country and keep it competitive? Think about these questions before make your decision.
What make U.S. leading the world in the past century? Creative people with talent from the whole world but not the people who always want to keep everything what it was!
