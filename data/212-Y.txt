I strongly support this rule. I am a current software developer in MA. Most of the projects last more than 1-2 years, if STEM opt extension did not exist, international students in those similar positions doing their projects would have to leave and their managers would have to look for new employees, which is "too complicated" according to my boss. I definitely hope that this rule could be successfully approved. This benefits both international STEM employees and the American companies they work for-- both employers and employees save a lot of troubles.
