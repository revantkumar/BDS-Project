As mush I appreciate all the effort to stop illegal immigration this action is simply opening fire to the wrong group of ppl. The reason that USA shows constant competitive advantage in a lot area is because we managed to convince the top minds in the world to stay and work in the US. This action will push a lot of smart non-US born students out of the US most of them can contribute significant value to their community. Pls stop this before its too late and fours your limited resources on the right topics. i.e. sending illegal immigrants back etc.
