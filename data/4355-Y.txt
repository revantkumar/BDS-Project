Jamie Stanward I strongly SUPPORT the OPT extension. The benefits it will bring is not only for the students but also for the USA itself.
With longer OPT extension, good students which are educated well in US university will have more time to contribute to the industry related to STEM.
Some might worry that these students would take some job position that were belong to the US citizen. But this is not true, I think the bar of hiring for these industry are generally the same, no matter what identity the candidate is. If one candidate with US citizenship does not qualify a job, even he get hired somehow, the disqualification would cause one get fired.
My point is that this rule does not necessarily cause a over crowded job market. Because the companies won't lower there bar and they will guarantee only the good ones stay.
