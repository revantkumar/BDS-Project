As a Master student in Engineering, I plan to graduate this December and look for a full-time position in United States. My major is Computer Science, and I believe that my academic background will allow me to contribute to the development of IT industry in the United States. However, quite a number of companies do not sponsor H1B visa for international student. Therefore, without OPT extension, I would have much less opportunities to work in the United States, and not able to apply my knowledge into the industry.
