I strongly support this new ruling. 

The rule is exactly there to solve the low wage problem. The wages for a lot of PhDs and Masters are the same or even higher than the US citizen. Only some other programs(ICC who abused the H1B program) may allow hiring unskilled workers from overseas. OPT is the wrong target if people really want to make sure that companies do not hire foreign nationals for lower cost. US citizens should be smart enough to have the right judgement for this issue, right?
