I really support this new regulation for F-1 student in STEM can work long time in U.S. Because STEM students would invetst their value when they achieve their degree in U.S.. U.S. also put a lot resource in these students. Without long term opt, they maybe choose to back thier country to invest their value which come from US resource. It wastes resources, even people we needed in US. A long term opt can help STEM student use their knowledge to work for US to generate more profit and keep the execellent people we needed. it really help US to attract more exellent people to student in STEM to work in US.
