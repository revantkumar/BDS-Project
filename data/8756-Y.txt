Linjun Li I strongly support the proposed rule for the CapGap relief for STEM students. I believe the proposed 24-month extension gives opportunities to not only the international students but also the US companies (and further the US economy). Without the extension, half of the international students with advanced degrees (who have been supported by US universities) will go back to their home country and work to improve the economy of their own country. Many of them will build startups or run businesses out of the knowledge and technology obtained from the US universities, intern companies, cooperation collaborations, etc. With a 12 months OPT, US may lose the best among the foreign students, with nontrivial odds.
