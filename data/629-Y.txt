Cathy Huang, USC I strong agree this policy. STEM student should have more OPT months.
First, short OPT month leads to unstable situation for STEM students. 
Second, these student really deserve your favor-they have skills US needs.
Third, most US local people do not major in STEM majors, therefore, giving more extension month won't thread US most local people in these area. Instead, because of these STEM students, US can develop much better and this benefits more US people.
