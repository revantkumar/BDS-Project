International students pay billions of dollars for tuition in US, accompanying the comsumption and stimulus of travel, housing, entertainment to help economy. Now if US say ABSOLUTELY NO on job, then all the benefits above are gone.

As a US citizen, it is much easier to get a job. Shame on those who yelling "keep the job on citizens" blabla. Have you ever seen how many companies say "U.S. Citizen or PR only"? If I have a student on F1 and a US citizen and the F1 student is 50% stronger than the citizen, I will definitely choose the citizen as it saves a lot of troubles on laws. However, this is not the case. It is often the F1 student is 500% stronger.

Being a citizen has already brought so many advantages, and you do not see that. You only want to sleep all day and people send money to your hand. Have you ever thought where are the money from? No work, no payment!
