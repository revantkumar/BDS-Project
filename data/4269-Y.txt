I am a student who is deciding to study in USA. Recently, I watched a series called America---The Story of Us. I know that the development of America is really a miracle. Generations of American people fighted for truth and freedom, among those people, huge amount were immigrations. I believe that the diversity of people made great contribution to the nation. Whats more, its diversity and freedom make America what it is like today. The frontier of technology and different thoughts convergence into the whole.

I am longing for study in America and felt the spirits of America. You know, it costs a lot to study in USA. After I finish my study, when I come back to my country, I hope to be competitive and mature disposition. I believe study in America not only means learning a lot, but also means accumulating enough professional skills, which can be achieved through internship and working experience. One of the reasons why it is attractive to study in USA is that you provide us the opportunity to gain enough professional skills. That is especially appreciated by my parents who will spend much for my further study. So, improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees and cap-gap relief for all eligible F-1 students are necessary and welcomed by students.

America is a place full of opportunity, you provide us a chance, we will make great contributions to the nation and communities by our skills.
