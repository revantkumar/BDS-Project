I strongly support this OPT Extension program for the following reasons: 

(i) Allowing the graduates with STEM degrees to stay for a longer time is a smart decision since they are well educated and can provide positive impacts to the whole society. Some people are narrow-minded, and they argue that allowing these graduates to stay will take up US Citizens' job positions. Such an argument is wrong in this situation. Most of these graduates, especially those with Ph.D. degrees, are working in high-tech companies, universities, and research institutes. They provide a strong support for the development of new technologies, which keeps the U.S. a leading position in the world. Products or research outcomes from these high-tech companies, universities, and research institutes can provide even more job positions for 
the U.S. Citizens. 

(ii) Another fact that supports the OPT Extension program is that most of the projects, especially research projects, are in the time frame of 2-3 years. If the graduates fail to maintain their valid status for a longer time, they have to 
leave the U.S.. As a result, the employers have to pay the loss for postponing the projects and training new employees. Therefore, OPT Extension is a Win-Win decision for both the employers and the graduates. 

(iii) It is also a stupid decision to force new graduates to leave the U.S. since the country has already spent a lot of resources to train them. And also, the U.S. will be no longer attractive to the prospective students if they find that they can not have enough time to get trained after they graduate. As a result, more students will choose European countries instead of the U.S..
