I strongly SUPPORT 24-month OPT extension decision.
OPT extension is needed for international students who earned STEM degrees for the following reasons.

For the benefits of U.S.
1) U.S will have high-end genius who earn STEM degrees, which will definitely make U.S. move a big step forward.
2) If STEM students don't get H1B and get back to their home country just because of the high competition of H1B lottery, it would be a huge loss of U.S. Because U.S country need them! Tons of technology firms cannot be without them. 
3) The most important thing is that U.S. is the dream land in everybody's mind in the world because of the ethic diversity, the freedom, the humanity, which can not live without STEM students. U.S is the place where could make people realize their dream. 

For STEM students.
1) STEM students will get more chances to get H1B visa if extension policy approved. They will stay in U.S, support the development of U.S. 
2)STEM students will learn more practical experience during the extension period. It's good for both U.S firms and STEM students.
