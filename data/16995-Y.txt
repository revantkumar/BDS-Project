I support H1B extension. Today the U.S. need talented STEM workers far more than anytime in the history. If we don't want to lose our competitive advantage in the next few decades, we have to attract enough people who can contribute to our high tech industry and economy.

In the long run, we will need to improve our education system to produce more qualified knowledge workers. However, we can achieve nothing by closing the door and pretend to be excused from competition. Turn away those talented foreign workers will never benefits our society but encourage our citizens to run away from reality. We need to face the problem that why we don't have enough qualified STEM students, not trying to let the talented people go to other countries where nthey are welcomed.
