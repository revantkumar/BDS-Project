The international students benefit us a lot. I do not care about how they make our society diverse, but I do feel they bring a lot of interests not only to the whole country but to me. I think they also would love to work in our country. Obviously, one year is not enough for them. They chose our country partly because we give OPT to them to gain experience. However, if they can only work for one year, why they still choose us rather than other cheaper developed country?
