I strongly support the rule of opt extension. This rule will not only benefit the F1 students but also, even more benefit the America & Americans.
1)Foreign students who come to US are all with great talent in many fields in which Americans are not that good and qualified. US needs the talented students to contribute to the country after graduation in many field, for instance, engineering field.
2)Many people who were foreign students before are now working in many big companies and waiting for their H1B visa. Canceling the extension of OPT will cause the short of talented employers for all those companies at the same time. There will be no people to maintain and support or even fix the bugs of your FB, Amazon and google account. Can you imagine that? And the companies will never recover from this cuz there are no more talented students can be employed.
3)From the economy prospect, I do believe F1 Students are making a grand and nonignorable contribution to the eco of this country. Without those talented sudents the eco will get lost decades. I am not kidding.
