I strongly SUPPORT the proposal because
1) Competition exists everywhere in the world. And it is the moderate competition that makes people and a nation stronger. Though this rule may bring some work-force competitions, it helps improve US's economy in technology innovations. 
2) Diversity is very important for the US. A lot of breakthroughs achieved in tech have been done by international students who came to the US for their Bachelor/Master/phD degrees. This rule can help maintain good reputations for most universities in the US. 
3) This policy is good for international students so that we can apply to what we have learned in classroom, which would generate feedbacks and improve the education system in the US.
