I strongly support Stem Extension OPT rule for 24 months as students in this field are highly talented and skilled from all parts of the world. They came to the United Stated to get the best of education and good amount of industrial training experience. The extension will allow them to train themselves more, contribute to the USA economy and also when they return to their home countries, apply these skills there as well. Education is important but without a formal industrial training its of no use. Learning and gaining experience takes times which cannot be done in just 12 months of OPT time. This Stem extension is highly essential. Moreover, these people are an asset to US companies and hence its economy.
