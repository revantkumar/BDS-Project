I STRONGLY SUPPORT the approval of this proposal and any opposition would be short-sighted and will do harm to American citizens and U.S. economy eventually.

U.S. is the worlds greatest country only because its been absorbing the best, the most talented people from the rest of the world. Cutting off this source of intelligence and their contributions will the start of the fall of a great nation in history.

Think about what happened to Detroit when the local workers object the importation of Japanese automobile manufacturing lines and skills Japanese automobile workers? The Detroit workers were too afraid of competition, which is actually contribution and beneficial competition in nature, and the result of stopping of importing talented Japanese human resources and skills is that Detroit now officially becomes an abandoned city! Goodbye, the once famous auto city! Any objection of embracing talents, advanced skills, and beneficial competition will only lead to the downfall of development, growth, and economy of a country!

This proposal is essential to keep the vibe of U.S. tech and financial industry pumping and has my fullest support.
