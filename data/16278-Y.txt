First of all, I am working as a software engineer at Bay Area. I have seen a lot of new graduates working here by using OPT. Companies in Bay Area still need a huge number of employees these days, in order to quickly create the prototypes and products into markets. Thus, extending OPT for STEM majors student is significant to help the development of those tech companies. As a result, the whole economy of United States will increase as tech companies grow fast.
Secondly, I know a lot of Ph.D students in STEM majors, use their OPT to continue their research at schools after graduation. They choose not to enter the industry because they believe their research results can motivate the whole professional industry, but not only some of companies. Also as we all know, one successful research is a long journey, and most students cannot finish it in one-year OPT. Therefore, providing extension for STEM OPT can really help them in their research. As a result, it will help the development of science and technology in the United States.
