I strongly support that we should improve and expand training opportunities for F1 students with STEM degrees. STEM degree holders are the key to the success of our country, the United States. We provide the best education to those best international students, and train them to be the best scientists and engineers. We should support them to contribute to our economy reboot before letting them go back to their country.
