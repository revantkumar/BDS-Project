I'm an international student getting Ph.D in chemistry. 

First, I appreciate the generous financial support from my school and the research funding agencies (NSF,DOE,NIH), without whose money I'm unable to study in US and finish my degree. 

Second, It takes years to train a STEM Ph.D and cost a lot of money, it doesn't make sense to kick us out of US after our graduation, it a huge waste of the resources for the US people, and no one wins. By extending the OPT for STEM, more highly educated international students can better serve the interests of US. 

Last, the unemployment rate just released this week is only 5%, meaning almost all American people have jobs. However, companies are still looking to recruit more skilled and highly educated people. Thus allowing STEM students to work longer using OPT won't take jobs away from American workers.
