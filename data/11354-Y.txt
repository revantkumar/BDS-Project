I strongly SUPPORT this proposal. The reasons are as following.
Firstly, the students who are studying STEM majors are precious portfolio for any country. They will contribute to the country which they live in. There is no reason to give up such giant human resource.

Secondly, as the nature of STEM students, no intern experience can be deadly to their career life. If a student just graduated without any working experience, how can he find a full time job? It is necessary to have a period of intern for them to get familiar with real life job.

Thirdly, a lot of US citizens complain about losing job but they refuse to self-examination. Why employers prefer international student while they need to pay for their visa? It's because international students are smart and hard working so they have better productivity to create more value for the employers. 
Those who complain about losing job should NOT blame those who can work better than them but try to improve themselves. To say the least of it, I dont believe those who dont want to self-examine can reach the height of international students.

Fourthly, the image of international students are paid low salaries is wrong. The salary was under the examination of DHS and it must be higher than the average level in the industry. In another words, they elevated the average payment instead of lower it. It proved that international students are more valuable than at least half of US citizens. Can anybody say the lower half people are useless? If no, then how can anybody say the people more valuable are abundant and needs to be deported?
