Jianyong Mo I think it is important to make sure that the OPT for STEM majors can be extended for 24 months. It is beneficial to the U.S. economy in a sense that those people have the skills that can improve the technologies, the efficiency in industry. Ultimately, the life quality of millions of Americans can be improved due to the contributions of those STEM majors who are not US citizens. 

It is not entirely true that, this extension will take away the job opportunities of Americans. Those people who are well educated are likely able to create job opportunities, for example by opening new companies. Also, as the whole U.S. economy, if the Science and Technologies are better developed, there are will be more job opportunities in the U.S. As a result, the quality of life for everyone in the U.S. can be improved to some extend.

It is also does not make sense that the U.S. gives those people the education opportunities. And once they finish their degrees, you let them go back to their own countries. U.S. should make use of those people to improve the economy in the U.S.

The key is that those people are well educated people, who can contribute to U.S. development.
