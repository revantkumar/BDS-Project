Claire Clark International Students added a whooping 26.8 billion dollars to US economy in a single year of 2013-2014. This rule is not taking away any job from us. In fact because of this rule more and more jobs are being created for American citizen with or without degree in STEM field. Our country has reached on top of the world because of the technology and because of this rule actually the whole world is contributing towards the technological growth of our country. These benefits will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally. The proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow them to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting.
