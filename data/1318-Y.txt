I strongly support this policy.
Approval of STEM IS NOT placing international students over american citizens. As far as I know, hiring is based on applicants' competency and skill set for a position. This means if an american citizen and an international student have the same skill set and the same competence, they will be both considered for the position (despite the fact that american citizens are always preferred to international students). There's no way that international students are given advantages because apparently in most of the situations american citizens are always preferred by recruiters.
