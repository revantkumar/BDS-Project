I SUPPORT the new regulations.

US has always held an open mind to talents from all over the work, which contributes largely to the diversity and energy of American society. Foreign students are given opportunities to study at US universities and they look forward to utilizing what they learned to make contributions to the development of US after graduation. There is few valid reason to stop this kind of contribution after training these students with various education resources, especially considering that STEM degrees are highly valued.

Besides, there is no evidence showing that improving training opportunities for F-1 students of STEM majors increase the unemployment of local students. In fact, most American companies would consider local students first if candidates are equally qualified. Limited opportunities for foreign students lead to limited talent pool for American companies, which force companies to hire the under-qualified and hurts the US economy eventually. 

Based on the reasons above, I strongly hope that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Bureau can 
pass the proposal. Thank you.
