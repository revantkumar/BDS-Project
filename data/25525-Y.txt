We should make this extension. Because of the profit which they can bring for us. Most of the international students they are kind and not aggressive . They obey the federal law, they also pay great taxes to government ,why they should be treated in a different way? If someone can't find a job, they should not put the blame on others but themselves. You don't put much effort in the science or engineering area, because most of you hate math . I agree to let the students stay, because I need them to pay their rent .
