I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons.
First of all, there are thousands of students in F-1 status working right now in the United States. They learned their skills here and they are now contributing with what they learned to the companies and to the whole society. The government should give these young and ambitious people a chance to let them continue their career here, making more contributions to the world. 
Secondly, diversity makes the United States where it is today and is of vital importance. People from different countries hold different ideas and it is these different voices that make huge progress in various fields. 
Last but not the least, competition does exist. But this is a good thing that needs to be encouraged rather than be suppressed. It is hard to imagine how a society without competitions could progress. Thus, we should promote competition, especially for technical areas. 
Hence, I strongly SUPPORT this proposal.
