Another payoff to the donations of Big Business. The proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates, who already are in deep debt compared to the F-1 students, who most likely had their education subsidized by their home countries. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs in STEM fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. The fact that the companies would enjoy 3 years of NOT paying their share of payroll taxes (equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay) makes these people even more attractive to Big Business and will exacerbate the situation. 

This has nothing to do with "Best and Brightest" and everything to do with lining the pockets of Business and Politicians.
