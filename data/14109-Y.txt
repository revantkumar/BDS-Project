This is really a good proposal. The increasing hiring for the OPT students already explains everything. It kills two birds with one stone, both the students and the companies will gain a lot benefits from it. 

There are some rumors saying that this will squeeze the native people's job market. This is not true though, I am an OPT holder and is hired by an IT company, I know that my company gave me the same salary as the native people, and they have to pay an amount of additional fee to request a working visa for me. The cost for hiring an OPT holder is actually a lot expensive than hiring an American, there is obviously no harm to the American's job hunting.

Thanks a lot for considering our benefits. Hope it can be passed and applied soon.
