I would strongly recommend passing the proposal! It's not only extremely important for the Chinese students and scholars to find a job in the USA but also an equally extremely for the USA to provide chances for those students with high education to serve the society using the knowledge and olintelligence that they gain in the process of studying in the U.S. . As we know, the possibility of getting a job for a foreign student is so much smaller compared with it for a native citizen, even when they are of the same level of ability. Many firms require a green card to employ. Those who don't may also have racial discrimination. Therefore it's crucial to provide long enough time and enough chances for the Chinese graduates and scholars to find a job in America.
