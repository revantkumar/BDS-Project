This is a great new rule. It would be greater if the e-verify requirement was not into it as it really complicates things for both employers and employees. Also, maybe a document readily available for the HR departments would be a great idea. The new idea of Mentoring and Training book would be a drawback for employers. Maybe that should not be implemented. Otherwise, the new rule and the enhancements (STEM OPT eligibility based on a previously earned STEM degree, the 24 months), are a great idea.
