I Strongly support the OPT 24months extension for stem majors. OPT extension is not only providing opportunities for international students, but also good for the relative industries in USA. In fact, the companies in these industries hire international students in the area, because there are not enough native students to full in the positions. If we cancel the extension of OPT, all the companies in these industries will suffer big disaster. Also the students who can come to study in USA, are all the best students in their country. If we cancel the OPT extension, we might lose these students. And they will go back to their home country to make big contributions, which is not good for USA.
