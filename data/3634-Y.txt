I wish the government could extend the OPT to 24 months. Because this is important not only for the international students who get Ph.D. in US. It makes them get more chances to work in US.It is also important for the government. Because these are highly educated people, they make more contribution to the development of the country more than the normal people. The more these people the government can attract, the more the government will benefit.
