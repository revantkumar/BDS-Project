I fully support the proposed rule. As an international student studying computer science in a community college in San Francisco bay area this rule would have a positive impact on my future career development in silicon valley as it allows me to gain more experience and have less worries about my visa. I believe this rule examplifies the American values of being open to different cultures and equal opportunities for everyone studying and working in this country. It would also attract more students to come to study here as they would not only gain knowledge but also more working experience. This can also strengthen U.S. economy as more talented people start making themselves available to contribute to its growth. 
Therefore I fully support the rule and believe it will not only benefit international students but also the local communities.
