What you mentioned is probably true for 1950's and 1960's. Now that over half a century passed and that is no longer the case today! A great amount of knowledge has been developed in the STEM disciplines for the last several decades, and nowadays fresh STEM grads will definitely need more training for work. Consider how much internship a student need today in order to obtain enough skills to qualify for a real job. 
I major in STEM too. My advisor achieved PhD in 1970s, and he went straightforward to a faculty position at a University. Nowadays a new professor would require at least 2-3 years of postdoc experiences before they are qualified for an academic position.
