I support OPT extension rule. The negative comments here have a common 
misunderstanding: I cannot find a job because there are a lot of foreigners.
Well, this already implies that STEM foreigners are so important to US 
because they are way better. 

In fact STEM graduates contribute to strengthen America's technology, to 
boost America's economy and to create more job opportunities for Americans.
Without their contribution, the job markets will shrink severely in America
. In the long run, American's leading role in economy and technology will 
disappear, and even less job opportunities as a result then. Some people 
here, however, hope America to sacrifice heavily to lose a huge number of 
well-educated and creative talents.
