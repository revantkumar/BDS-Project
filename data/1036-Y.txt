The new OPT extension would be a great policy beneficial not just to international students, but also to US high-tech companies, which contribute to quite a large portion of the economy of the US. I strongly support this new rule.

1. A regular 12-month time frame might not be long enough for international students to make contributions in meaningful projects in most companies. Actually, some of the companies like Google has complex internal tools and systems, which have a sharp learning curve. It would take several months for new interns to get used to these tools. Without this extension it would be very difficult for those companies to find projects suitable for them.

2. The United States has become the most attractive country for international students in the world. However, were this policy rejected, its attraction would be severely harmed.
