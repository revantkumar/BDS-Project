Jim Anderson I strongly support this proposal. 
It is very beneficial for this country to employ as many high-tech talents as possible. This rule will also attract other talented students from all over the world to help make America better. It will not affect normal US workers because we can not provide as many high-tech workers as this country needs. This rule will only benefit this great nation.
