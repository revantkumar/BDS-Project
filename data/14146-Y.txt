I totally SUPPORT this proposal, US need international students in many aspects. 

In many universities, especially in engineering or science school, more than a half of undergraduates are international students and almost all masters and PHD are international. If those students leave US as soon as thy graduate, this may cause lacking of engineerers and scientists in US, and those good tern just help other acontries to cultivate talents, which do no good to US.

By the way, many international students engage the job normally Americans do not want to do, so in fact OPT will not have influence on American employment rate.
