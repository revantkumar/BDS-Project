I totally support the new OPT STEM Extension rule. Instead of adding supporting comments, I will REFUTE those COMMENTS THAT HOLD OPPOSITE opinions.

First of all, seems like most of the negative comments are of the same format. Similar world count, similar ideas and similar no explanation. I highly doubt if some organizations are hiring people to make these mechanical comments. Personally, I don't think these comments should count, because they have no evidence and explanation to support their ideas. 

Secondly, extending OPT period don't means American people can't get hired. As a software engineer with industrial experience I have never seen a native American who has a CS degree don't have a job. The fact is tech companies can't hire enough qualified engineers only by hiring native candidates. They need more qualified international candidates. Tech company are still hiring every year, native candidates and international candidates are sharing the same opportunity, I don't see any problem extending OPT STEM Extension rule. 

Thirdly, some people are saying that international students have negative influences on the life of native America people. This is totally wrong. The increasing of international students will bring a lot of job opportunities to native American people. Let's assume 30% of a university students are international. If these international students don't come to America, 30% of the restaurant, book stores and grocery stores will be closed because they don't have enough customers. Maybe some of them don't even know how to open a browser, who will fight for these people? 

In the last 400 years, America is proud of its fairness and diversity. This is the reason why America is being so strong and attractive. Why do you want to kill the diversity and fairness by yourselves?
