I strongly SUPPORT the OPT program for the following reason:

1) International students from all over the world have gone through high bar selection to have to opportunity to study in Universities in USA. They create value for this country and deserve more chance.

2) US citizens could not fill the void of US tech industry. US tech company prefer hiring US citizens if they have the same capability in those fields, but they are hiring large number of international student simply because they can create more value for the company.

3) Cancel of the OPT may give more chance to US citizens for short term but it will hamper the development of technology without giving enough opportunity to those talented and ambitious in making progress in state-of-art technology.
