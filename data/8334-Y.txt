I believe it is important to improve training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees. We, as a country, have invested heavily in their education. Expanding these opportunities will allow our economy to reap the benefits of this investment. It is important to note that the US job market will always put US Citizens and Green Card Holders as the highest priority. For example, the aerospace industry already limits many jobs to US citizens and green card holders. In addition, there are increased costs for companies to hire international students and possibly sponsor visas. Therefore this policy will little or negative impacts on the US citizen/green card holders in the STEM field. In fact, the US economy has more opportunities in the STEM fields than can be filled by US citizens and green card holders. Allowing international students to legally work in U.S. will help fill this gap and, as a result, will be eventually beneficial to all US citizens.
