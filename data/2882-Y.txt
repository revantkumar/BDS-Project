I agree on this policy.
Being an immigrant country, America has been leading the world's technology and economy for decades. One pivotal reason is that America is open to all talented and skilled guys for all over the world. The OPT extension allocates U.S. companies more time to evaluate and hire employers from different countries, which is definitely helpful for economy of U.S. 
Another more realistic reason is, if this policy is cancelled in such a hurry. Almost all the companies in Silicon valley would go into panic. This will harm to U.S. economy severely, since those high-tech companies are the future of America.
