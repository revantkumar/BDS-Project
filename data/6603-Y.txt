Jack Crawford Contrary to popular belief, immigrants create jobs for Americans. Every immigrant, legal or illegal, who works for a living must eat, providing work for farmers and ranchers. Each one must live somewhere, providing jobs for carpenters, plumbers, electricians. If that immigrant supports a family, they have to eat and live somewhere, too. They wear clothes, providing work for cotton farmers, maybe a few foreign T-shirt makers, and a host of delivery truck drivers and retailers. I think you get the idea. Foreigners who work here are not a drain but a benefit to us. Let them stay.
