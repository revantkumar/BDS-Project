I believe the OPT extension is critical and necessary. I am strongly support the Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students rule. As a STEM program degree holder, I am proud to say that the OPT helped me a lot on connecting knowledge dots with the real business world. By working on a job that is highly related to my major, I found that I better understand what I am doing and potentially become a very useful person to the society. I felt that the OPT is providing me an opportunity to be good at what I am studying for and eventually prepares me to be a better person that could contribute to the world no matter later on where I will work at. Also, the company I work(OPT) for is greatly appreciated the value I bring to them. They are even talking about expanding business internationally with my help. I will be a good intermedia person to help them better understanding the global market. Eventually, I will help them bring their business overseas. The immediate benefits is not only help boost U.S economics, but also American citizens in our company would have the opportunity to explore different offices locations all over the world.
The company I am working for now is still a start-up. I believe that my contribution can help the company grow and create more job opening positions. (which is happening right now)

So, I believe this rule could not only be beneficial to me(learning experience) but also be beneficial to the citizens of United States(help create more jobs and help expand business internationally). The win-win situation is what the people of this country want to see and will see.
