I agree with the proposed rules. The STEM extension program is very much needed. Providing a training opportunity is beneficial to American STEM companies and the U.S. economy. It would be a waste to let the highly skilled students leave and work for other countries while they could be contributing to the U.S. economy. The lack of a proper training program would also discourage prospective students to choose U.S. academic programs, as well as discourage foreign students in the U.S. to enter the STEM field, which could negatively affect the development of STEM companies in the U.S. in the future. That being said, it is important to make sure the opportunities are only offered to qualified students. Thus I strongly support the stricter regulations including the mentoring program and the accreditation requirements.
