The OPT proposed rule change is illegal and counter-productive. In its' first 5 years, OPT cost 430,000 American jobs and cut $4 Billion out of Social Security and Medicare.

This OPT program favors foreign workers over Americans. That is inherently wrong, when we have a shortage of STEM jobs for our own citizens. 

Employers save 7.65% by hiring foreign workers. These foreigners are paid $60-$90,000 per year, and, because they don't pay payroll taxes, it costs Social Security $1 Billion each year. This is unjust to American taxpayers.

If you add OPT-12 and OPT-29 workers to existing F-1 student workers, almost 700,000 jobs are already filled by foreign workers in an economy that has 94,000,000 unemployed or under-employed Americans.

This OPT program is already out of control. Don't make it worse.
