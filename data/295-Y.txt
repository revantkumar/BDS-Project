I strongly support this rule. We, international students, needs enough training after graduating, especially for our stem majors. Engineering students can't learn everything from the class. We need to practice what we learned in the industry. The United States can provide more opportunities than any other places in the world. Having enough training experience will make us more competitive when we go back to our home country. The 24-month OPT extension is also necessary for a graduate to finish a project before he leaves America. It's unfair for international students if you charge us high tuition but don't give us opportunities to gain practical training experience. I'm also astounded to see such overwhelming hostility against foreigners in the comments.

The OPT program has a time limit. It's not a job visa program nor its a immigration program. People will leave after they finish this 1-year or 3-year program if they didn't get a job visa. In the long term, the job opportunities in US taken by foreigners are those taken by the job visa holders rather than the international student graduates.

I also doubt if the United States can educate enough qualified student to fulfill the need of the job market for high-tech job positions. At least in my school, about half of the student who attended computer science classes are Chinese and Indians. We are only interested in the part of the US job market that the Americans can't fulfill the need of. We don't intend to take away any other job opportunities.

I chose to come to study in the United States partly because I was promised this OPT opportunity then. I would be disappointed at this country and its hostility against foreigners if this program was revoked. Again, for my own interests, for what this country promised, I strongly support this rule.
