Steve Young I strongly support this new OPT policy, which is helpful in many perspectives. 

1. Foreign students pay lots of tuition, which has helped the universities gather fundings. That is very useful for education industry. Without OPT STEM, I do not think we can attract so many foreign students, which is a loss to higher education industry. 
2. We all know that competition makes us better. Because of the foreign workers, we know that we need to work hard instead of just relying on what we have already had. Also, we could learn a lot from those people, academic, culture, etc. I have a Chinese co-worker who has helped me understand some complex statistics methods and given Asian travelling suggestions. 

3. Foreign workers make companies much stronger, especially the high tech ones. Our technology is developing so fast and we need those STEM people to join us 

I do not quite understand the negative comments, which says that we should place the right of citizens over non-citizens. Just remember that, every citizen or our ancestor once was an immigrant. It is those immigrants who built the United States and keep making it a more attractive country. 

Please approve the OPT STEM policy. Thank you!
