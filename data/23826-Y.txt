Though I am an international student in stem, for me, the OPT doesn't necessarily has to be 24 months. Id like to make one point clear though:
There is an easily neglected consequence of cutting short the stem OPT: holding back potential brilliant PhD students in a love way. For example, my boyfriend is doing his Master degree in China and me in U.S. Both of us are finishing our Masters degrees in 2017. My boyfriend is consider coming to U.S for a PhD degree, under the condition that I can also stay in U.S. working after graduation. However, if I have to go back after only one years working while he still has 4-8 years to finish a PhD, he definitely would not apply for a PhD program in U.S. But he is really enthusiastic in his field, so he probably would get a PhD in China, and I also go back to China without working in U.S even for one year. I can always go back to China. After all, the opportunities in Beijing are no less than we can find in the U.S. Besides, all my families are in China. 
As far as we know, there are at least 4 couples in the same situation as ours. All the potential applicants are from top institutions in China. US higher education has been long short of enough students to do research. If the attractiveness of US education went down because of the cancellation of the extension, then the US research and high tech would be the first victim.
