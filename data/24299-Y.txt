Extending OPT to students is in general a good move for the following reasons:

- It lets their career evolve and take risks in the immediate years after graduating when they have most energy and are looking for challenges. Graduates can work without being bogged down by complexities of obtaining a speciality occupation visa
- EAD makes recent foreign graduates attractive to employers who have some appetite for hiring people fresh out of school but do not want to invest heavily upfront in them. Employers are able to take chances and dip into a larger pool of graduates and scholars
- It lets students in Schools remain focused on what they came to the US in first place - to study and research without thinking too much about if they have to pack their bags and move out soon after graduation. One year in OPT is not nearly enough to allow people fresh out of school to employ their skills and find their calling. Like the great education schools in US impart, it is equally important to get a great grounding at work before students can go out on their own, to their home countries or anywhere in the world and do justice to their education and investments. Experience in US benefits the students, the society and organizations of all sizes in US.

There is another large pool of students in US, who are also non resident aliens but who are not on F-1 visas. They are partners of primary beneficiaries of workers in specialty occupations. Partners on H-4 and L-2, for example, or the beneficiaries of H-1 and L-1B visas themselves. While they may be attending school full time, they do not get the benefit of an OPT after earning their degrees. OPT and CPT should be extended to such students as well, to allow them to use their education gained in US without being chained by their visa classifications. There is a large pool of such dependent partners that goes to schools and works as hard, if not more, as students on F-1, but is deprived of an opportunity to be gainfully employed just be
