I think OPT Program not only benefits international student but also Native American workers. 
1)American companies can accumulate plenty of talent international students. They will contribute a lot effort to the companies, which can largely help native company or startups gain more profit and expand. The growing companies, in return, will offer various positions helping increasing the employment rate in the USA.
2)If OPT can be extended, there will be more chances that international students can help to improve the community. So that USA residents will gain more benefits. 
3)OPT extension will attract more international students to study abroad in USA. That will bring considerable profit to the universities, shops, and etc. 
After all, OPT program will bring more benefits than peoples imagination.
