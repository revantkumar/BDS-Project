I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:

1. It enhances the collaboration of International business between USA corporations and other international companies.

2. School have invested so much resources into International students and expect them to bring more chances and opportunities back.

3. International students also help american students realize that the world is changing and they need to work harder for their country's future. It's like a mutual benefits for American students to learn other cultures and tradition without stepping out of USA.
