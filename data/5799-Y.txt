Wenxian Zhang I believe the STEM OPT 24-month extension is a great idea, which benefits both companies in the US and international students. This means it will finally accelarate the American economic growth with no doubt.

First of all, as an international studens studying STEM in the US, I believe the OPT period is one of the most important reasons that many of us chose to come to the US for further study. There are no such great opportunity in Europe or Australia. The industry in America is also so active and creative that students of STEM all around the world would like to make their knowledge into practice here. If the extension get approved, I believe that more and more students would like to come to the US to study and live for a while.

Secondly, for the US companies. According to the OPT rules, this practical training could only be valid if international students get offer from American companies, which would like to give visa sponsorship to the students. This rule protect local people a lot because if the companies don't think the students are good enough for their positions or they don't need that many people in STEM to work for them, they can just hold the offer and find some one better for the position. In a conclusion, companies here do need many STEM major people to work for them and many excellent engineers and scientists within this group are not citizen of the US. If they lose the opportunity to work in the US companies or just have one year OPT period, they can't contribute a lot to the company even though they want to do that. And this also can make companies less productive or, even worse, lose diversity and great idea that might make a difference.

Finally, I want to say that OPT 24-month extension can definitely contribute to the economic growth of the US and this extension make a lot of sense to the world if it gets approved.
