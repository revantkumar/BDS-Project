It's ridiculous to cancel the expanding training opportunities for STEM students. There is no relationship between this rule and unemployment status of citizens. Companies will only hire International students when those people have desirable skills or show abilities that companies need but the other American candidates don't have. That means, International students will only be hired when companies don't have other choices. Otherwise, companies will just hire Americans to avoid further work and money on immigration visa application. Therefore, the expanding training opportunities for STEM students do not disturb US citizens finding jobs at all. PLEASE DON'T MIX UP the official regulation with some people's absurd understanding that comes from their lack of understanding about the rule and hates toward immigrants!
