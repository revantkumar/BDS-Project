I have been in US for more than two years and currently working for a company with OPT after graduation. As most foreign students do, I come to US for higher education and plan to learn and gain practical working experience in several years before returning home country. I support the OPT extension policy. The new rule with extended OPT period will allow foreign students to work for one or two more years under F-1 visa. This could help US colleges attract more foreign students and develop in all academic areas. It also facilitates academic and culture communication with the world. Meanwhile, US companies or institutes will benefit from the contribution of diversity and talent of foreign students. Many aspects of economy will be favorably impacted directly or indirectly, for example, the stimulation on domestic demand, bigger labor market etc.
