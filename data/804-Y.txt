As an immigrant nation, the U.S. has always benefited from a continual infusion of intelligent, hardworking immigrants. Young immigrants refresh our aging work force and bring new perspectives, new ideas to help us face challenges and solve problems in this country. For these reasons, I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months because we need to give the best and the brightest students every opportunity to succeed in the U.S.
