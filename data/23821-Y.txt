I strongly support DHS'S new OPT proposal! I do have lots of friends who achieved their advance degree in US but has to go back to their mother country due to they can't get H1B after 2 chance of lottery! I also hear about that lots of India engineers who never have a chance to land on US territory, Just submitted H1b visa sponsorship in India. But, lucky enough to get H1B and can work in US! This is definitely unfair to those Engineer working in US. This is big waste of our outstanding education system! The people we cultivate and in need, But can't stay in US and make more contribution to our economy.
