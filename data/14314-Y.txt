I think the STEM extension is a very good way to help US keep leading the world in innovation. US should give a way to allow US educated foreign students to work for and help our country.

Someone has pointed that these foreign students may grab the jobs from citizens. This is totally wrong. The foreign students are making contributions to US and they may become citizens one day. So they are creating jobs.
