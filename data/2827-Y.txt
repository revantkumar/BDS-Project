I strongly agree with this OPT extension statement. This decision is worthy-thinking and it will bring a good economic, social and cultural impacts to US and to the whole world. 
1. US is a strong country that god is always blessing and especially the science and technology of US are the world top 1. STEM extension policy will absorb more talents around the world who are good at science and technology in US which will lead the economy increased and in my opinion, US is pleased to accept talents from the whole world.
2. US has more science and technology enterprises than any other countries and most software writer and IT-related workers are from STEM students. One-year OPT is too short for STEM students to work in a company. As we known, the high turnover rate of personnel in a company will lead the instability which will at last lead the instability of the whole industry, whole economy and whole society.
3. Maybe the OPT extension policy harmed some American people's interest because they lost their jobs for the competitive STEM students. But under the global competitiveness, that is not a good reason to shorten the working period for STEM students, because STEM students truly brought big interests in the industry.
4. STEM students cannot acquire much experiences during one-year internship but if they have more time they can do much more things and the US study and working trip will help a lot after they go back to the motherland.
