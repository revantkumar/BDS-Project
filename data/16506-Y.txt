I think it is necessary to improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 immigrants students with stem degrees. I am one of them. I study hard and would like to get a chance to apply knowledge into practice. it can be a ggod bridge for me to work here for a while and then get back to my country. It helps me better learn the difference and get ready for my career.
