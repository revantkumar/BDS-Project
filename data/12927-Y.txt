I strongly agree with this rule and I feel it is fair to give that chance to each student who studied in US. H1B quota being less and more applications each year- masters quota for 20K doesn't do justice. Each student later on gather knowledge for company they are working for and have to leave irrespective of CGPA, performance in the company and work he or she has been doing with dedication. Currently STEM Ext students get 1 more chance for H1B and that may ruin career as it's totally depend on luck. Lottery system is too luck driven than performance driven and that is not fair to anyone who has done hardships to complete masters and get job in stipulated time allowed. If probability of losing out on lottery chance is counted - this efforts will go in vain and student may not opt to come to higher studies to US as immigration is lottery based rather than being performance or point based. Lot of talent has returned back or opted for other countries where point based system gives more value to their profile. If h1b probability is increased this might stop and improved STEM Extension rule is first step towards betterment of students. So I strongly agree with extension and expect similar improvement in H1B rules for attracting better talent to US
