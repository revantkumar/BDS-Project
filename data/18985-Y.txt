Before I became disabled, I earned an Associate's Degree in Computer Information Systems from 
Henry Ford Community College in Dearborn, Michigan. I graduated with a 3.77 GPA. During my 
time in college, the government made it easier for foreign students to get jobs in my field of study 
at a lower wage than what American students would be paid. When those positions were filled, 
the IT companies kept raising the bar, making it increasingly more difficult for American students 
to get these jobs. I attended evening classes half-time because I was working a full-time job as 
an auto parts driver at a Ford dealership. During the five years I was in college, the standard went 
from 2 semesters of CIS to a Bachelor's Degree in CIS with 2 years experience. The best job I 
could find after graduation was an adviser job in a call center enrolling customers in the OnStar 
system. This is unconscionable! STOP THE OPT PROGRAM FOR FOREIGN STUDENTS NOW!!
