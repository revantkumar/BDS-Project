As a potential student in U.S, I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. During the process of application to graduate schools, I have multiple choices among US, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and British, with a computer science degree in top universities. The most important reason why America is so fascinating to me is the training opportunities provided after my graduation. It can not only accumulate my own experience. Standing in the American's view, we thus are more likely to spend our best time period in life to make contributions to the holistic society. I have to admit competition may cast stress to natives to some extent. However, it can also serve as an incentive to force students to make progress. BTW, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents.
