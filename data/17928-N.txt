Comment Submitted by Rebecca Owensby has a couple of false or illusionary assumptions that would cause you lead to the unjustified conclusion.

1. It is not true that US companies would avoid paying payroll taxes for OPT students, here is what the truth is:

"Unless exempted by a tax treaty, F-1 and J-1 students earning income under practical training are subject to applicable, federal, state, and local income taxes. Information on tax treaties may be found in Internal Revenue Services Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens, and 901, U.S. Tax Treaties."

"Generally, F-1 and J-1 students are exempted from social security and Medicare tax requirements. However, if F-1 and J-1 students are considered "resident aliens" for income tax purpose, social security and Medicare taxes should be withheld. Chapter 1 of Internal Revenue Services Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens explains how to determine the residency status of international students."

2. It is not against US visa law that student stays after the students completed their degree by maintaining a LEGAL status. OPT is one legal students for F-1 visa.

3. "We do not want to hire foreign students over qualified US students who are trying to enter the US workforce." 

For this comment I would ask who is "WE"? Companies would actually pay extra to hire foreign students than hire US students, and the OPT STEM extension is for solving the problem that there are not enough US students who devote in STEM and related industries. There are two facts: 1. Not enough US workforce are in STEM industry; 2. Not all US workforce are as qualified as foreign students and that's why the US companies would pay even more to hire international students.
