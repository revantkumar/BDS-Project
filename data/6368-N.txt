Please, can a representative of your department call me and explain what is NOT wrong with this statement off your website, - gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students and recent college graduates over Americans.
Who is more important to the US government, foreign students or US citizens? I think your message is clear, profit for companies, who probably donate to BO and HRC, are waaaay more important than the poor slobs who have to pay the taxes to run these organizations that must stay up all night thinking of new and creative ways to screw US citizens.
I work next to the headquarters of Direct TV (now AT&T), at lunch time you'd think you just got off the bus in New Delhi. I have nothing against east Indian folks, but I can't possibly believe that THAT many, of any nationality, are so desperately needed to fill jobs because US citizens are too dumb to handle them.
How about spending the resources that you expend for this program to partner US companies and schools to train and educate our own citizens for the jobs they'd rather fill with CHEAP foreign labor? What a concept! US companies working to get US people qualified to work for them.
Please pass to your superiors that if you are so in favor of helping east Indians or Greeks or Burmese, why not move there and set up an employment agency? Just let US people do US jobs and stop being a whore for big business.
A disgusted taxpayer.
