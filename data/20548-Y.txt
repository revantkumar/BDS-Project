I DO support the STEM extention. This gives the US economy more opportunity to develop with the help of these international students. The competition makes the labor market lively and strong. America need real high-technology talents, not someone cannot find a job cause they do not work hard sitting in front of the computer complaining the hard-working international students took their job opportunities. The diversity and equality sets the real America spirit free.
