Luyao Yang For students of the STEM field it is important to give them the extra 24 months of on-the-job training that enables them to fully learn and understand the application of their degree in the industry. A recent survey of employers show that most companies requiring workers in STEM fields spend more than 9 months training their employees after they are hired, and a work authorization that limits the students to only 12 months of training essentially gives them no chance to actually practice their studies. 

As the OPT program do limit the amount of time an alien can continue working, a foreigner will not be taking jobs a US citizen could have taken. All OPT workers are in essence temporary and most students have no prior work experience; there is no incentive for businesses to hire a STEM student on OPT over a U.S. citizen. Should a company decide to sponsor H-1B status, it is generally due to the excellence of the worker. Furthermore, the H-1B cap is set separately with other requirements imposed by DOL, so although an extension of the OPT program will increase the number of non-citizens pursuing STEM jobs, it is important to note that they are all limited to the timeframe provided by OPT, and only a capped number will be allowed to actually immigrate.
