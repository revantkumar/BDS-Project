1. The past decades have been proved that the skilled immigrants have been made great contributions to the economy of America and they also created a lot of job opportunities for the natives.

2. The government should keep the students who learned knowledge from U.S. and let them make contributions to the U.S.

3.It's helpful to improve the competitive in US since skilled diversity students can bring innovative ideas and they keep some American industry prosperous.
