I strongly support this rule for following reasons:

1. America is the place which gives everyone equal chance. Talented students who come to US deserve more time to practice their skill sets. 

2. It's good for US to have talented foreign students to work for their companies, especially in technology and math related area.

3. It makes US more competitive in terms of higher education and thus could attract more talented foreign students to come to US to study.
