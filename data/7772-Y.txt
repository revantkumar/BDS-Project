US should give more opportunities to students who received their education here other than people who cheated and came here just for jobs!!!

The OPT system will give US university graduates a better chance to win the work visa lottery! Actually in my opinion the lottery system also is defected! Tens of thousands foreign workers without any US degree cheated on their resume and came here for works, and they submitted several application per person to have largest chance win the work visa lottery. Students with US degrees have less chance to win the lottery simply because they follow the rules!
