I strongly support the new STEM program. The STEM extension WILL NOT lead to a higher unemployment for American citizens. Why extension only for STEM? That's because those high-tech companies CANNOT find enough citizen employees. The tax from these high-tech companies is one of the main income in some states (such as California). Without these foreign STEM students, the allowances will be even worse, which will lead to a higher unemployment.
