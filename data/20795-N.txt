A Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand:

1. OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
2. OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.

Just these two takeaways reveal how devastating this rule will be to our U.S. citizens:
1. Adding to the 93 plus million US citizens already out of work; and
2. Taking more money away from US senior citizens at a time when more has been removed from Social Security and Medicare.

The proposed regulations are irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.
