By extending an OPT extension, students who earned their knowledge in USA will contribute here in the United States instead of their home country. And it won't cause any effect to the native US born students either because, people who have talent always get jobs. If there is no extension then international students may choose other countries instead of USA. This will cause effect in USA economy due to lack of students in universities. Here most of the universities are filled with International students and they are paying all their money for tuition fee. If there is no OPT extension then they can't pay their education debts in their home countries. So, F1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees need 36 months OPT period.
