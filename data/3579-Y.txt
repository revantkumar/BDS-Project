Becky ANONYMOUS To whoever is arguing $xx million dollar is removed from social security and medicare, you are simply misled by that so-call senate report.

These foreign students are only in the US temporarily, because their OPT is 3-year tops. Will they use any of our SS and medicare? Sure not. Is it fair to ask them to contribute to our retirement? I do not think so.

Stop arguing that they steal our tax dollars. Speaking of stealing our retirement, look at the benefits illegals are enjoying, that is how our tax dollars are spent.

OPT program? It is sure a good thing for America.
