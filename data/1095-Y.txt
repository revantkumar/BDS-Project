I see many negative comments to keep foreigners out and stuff.
To explain to my friends OPT or STEM extension are non-immigrant visas which only give F-1 students legal status to work in their field of education. I don't understand how they can compete with you, If you really want fair competition in US, remove the restriction of field of education and then just look at the competition posed.

The truth is F-1 students want to get educated in US universities, gain practical training, earn money $$ to repay loans and go back to the home country. Just imagine if STEM OPT is vacated, I can assure current students will be effected but mainly the US economy will take a hit. How you ask: Every year more than 60000 students take ETS offered GRE/TOEFL to get admission and statistics show the highest takers are form India or China which will go down with OPT rule vacated. Admissions will take a hit so Universities can fund themselves anymore and if you think American universities are having enough students just goto the several admission tours US universities do atleast 3 times a year in every city in India, China to get qualified students who pay FEES without any kind of aid.
H1b fees is used for border protection and US govt budget esp USCIS benefits from every 350$ students pay for processing pre-OPT, Post-OPT, STEM-extension and pay highest tax amounts without any benefits as classified non-resident alien.
So the ball is in your field, choose what to do but with leaders like Modi taking steps to improve economy and living standards now if you give a reason for students to go back and not choose to get fancy degrees from US, thats your loss.
This is a good initiative to retain talent in US so please approve this rule and increase f1-to H1 conversion- we want to be legal immigrants.
