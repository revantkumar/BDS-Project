I believe the F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees have the strong capabilities to make great contributions to the science, technology, and innovation of American. Other than that, these students are normally very smart and have clear plan for their future. In another word, these people have more potentials to make treasure to the society and build work opportunities for the Americans in future. There are so few F-1 students in American. I believe it will not induce any immigration problems even granting all these F-1 students green cards. This policy will greatly increase the creativity and capability of American society.
