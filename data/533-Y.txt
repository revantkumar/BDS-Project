Dear Mr. Johnson:

I write to you regarding the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. I recently graduated from University of Florida with a Ph.D in Materials Science and I am on OPT status. 40% of UF graduate students are international students and a vast majority of those are in the United States on F-1 visas. I and most of my previous colleagues and classmates will be strongly affected by the Proposed Rule.

I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I'm particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months.

OPT and OPT extension are the great opportunities for me to get training and contribute my educational background and technical skills to US employers. I am planning to use OPT extension after my OPT ends so OPT extension is extremely important to me. I am very concerned with the possibility that my STEM OPT Extension might be disrupted by recent court actions, upcoming court actions, and delays in this rule-making process. I commend DHS for working quickly to prepare this new Proposed Rule.

I also find the newly proposed OPT rules regarding Mentorship Training Program very helpful and meaningful. 

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule and thank you for all of your hard work in keeping America safe and providing educational and training opportunities to F-1 students.


Best regards,

Minfei Xu
