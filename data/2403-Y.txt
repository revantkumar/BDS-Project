Look at all those negative disgusting comments make me heartbreaking. Foreign students pay tax and pay tuition and they support the United States of America. For those people who claim that OPT extension rule takes away their opportunity, just imagine what if there is no opt program. Much fewer foreign students will come to the United States to study and do research, there will be no innovation to drive the economy and those universities which rely on foreign students' tuition will collapse and in turn US students will lose educational resources. Do those US citizens really want all those consequences to happen?

The new OPT rule has already strong provisions to prevent unfair displacement of US workers and I highly doubt those people who post negative comments never try to read it
