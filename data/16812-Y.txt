It will be a great decision. We should get this rule out as soon as possible.
Students who come to United States and study in STEM and graduate with a degree are really top talents to the country. Many of them study the most difficult subjects and some of them were granted scholarships. Many resources have been allocated to prepare them ready for the future work and research. It will be great loss for the country if they can't stay simply because of the lack of H1B quota. The OPT will be a buffer to solve these problems.
The US is the best country in this world because it never closes its door to those people who could create great value and make this country even a better place for anyone else.
