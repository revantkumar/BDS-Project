I STRONLY SUPPORT OPT EXTENSION!

I read through the comments from people who oppose to these rules. One thing that makes me ponder is: why there are so many people afraid of challenges that brought by international students, but ignoring the economic development they brought?? Please don't blame international students for unemployment in your family. Skilled people can find jobs anywhere.
