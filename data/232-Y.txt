I strongly agree on this newly proposed extension for STEM international students. As we all know, international students in STEM contribute a lot of their passion and time into development of technology in US nowadays as a return for the high quality education they receive in US. Therefore, this extension can allow more STEM international students to apply what they learn in US institutions to solve some real problems US industries may have. What's more, this diversity is exactly why USA succeeded in the past. People from different culture background go school in US together and share all kinds of experience and learn from each other. More importantly, they provide different perspectives of development of US society. In addition, this extension offers up to 3 years to those international students who are working or will be working for companies in US. This period of time is very beneficial especially for US companies because they do not need to hire or train new people every year: those hired international students can work for them for three years, which greatly save money and time and can be interpreted as a way to be competitive with other companies all over the whole world. So why not let this pass?
