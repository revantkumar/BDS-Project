I strongly support this proposed rule and believe that the rule is beneficial for the United State's economy and technology.

United State of America is the great country that attract the most brilliant brains to develop the highest-ended technologies. Allowing the STEM major international students to work longer in U.S. will help the Unite State of America to continuously lead the front of the world's science and technology. The contributions from STEM major international students will also benefit the U.S. economy and ultimately bring up more job opportunities. 

I object the opinion that this rule will decrease the job opportunities for STEM major U.S. citizens. Even if the rule is approved, U.S. citizens are still in an advantageous position in the job market considering their language and networking advantages. The technologies companies will consider hiring STEM major international students only if there are no equivalent compatible U.S. citizens in the job market, and if it is the case, a policy that support the companies to hire the employee that best fit the job becomes important.
