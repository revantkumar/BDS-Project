I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. American higher education, especially in STEM fields is competitive in the world for a reason, that is people in are able to apply what they have learned in school to workplace in the OPT period. This plays a great role for me and my many friends in deciding which school to apply and to join.

2. Thus, if the OPT is instead canceled, it is for sure there will be much less international student coming to US. Because there are many countries in the world provide excellent higher educations such as England, Germany, Canada, etc, whose work permit are much easier to obtain. And as we all know, international students makes great contributions the US economy, including tuitions and living expenses.

3. Most people coming to US for higher education are very excellent students. The development of US industries and academia would benefit from their contribution greatly. However, it takes time to make meaningful contributions, no matter in industry or academia. A 24-month extension would make the process much easier and also make significant contributions possible.
