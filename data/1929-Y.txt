Ryan Wang I think it is a good thing to do to give F1 holder the OPT extension for following reasons:
1. most of STEM students build their academic connections here during their graduate study, they can contibue to contribute to science and technology if they stay here
2 STEM field like mathmatics, physics, biology and chemistry has more than half of international students because a lot ofamericans are not willing to pursue their career in these areas. internationals are a supplement instead of competitor. 
3 the statistics showed almost more than half of the publications and scientific discoveries were accomplished by internationals in these fields. they are very important driving force to keep america greater than other countries. 
4.
