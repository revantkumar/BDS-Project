I would support this proposal. Obviously, the extension will increase the international students' chance of staying in the US with legal status, considering the tiny little chance without extension. 

Since the extension only works for students in STEM programs, the impact on the citizens's chance of getting a job is ignorable. This is especially true if one could consider the fact that the majority of the students have a very clear plan to go back to their home country after 3-4 years of working experience in the US. It is quite reasonable for Chinese students since the economic of China is getting better and better, and they are more family-oriented which gives them the motivation to go back.

Also, we could not ignore the fortune created by international graduates who work in IT industry, or technical related departments in all types of companies. Without the extension, there will be a huge loss of all those talented employees. One should also notice that if the husband/boyfriend has to leave the US because of the expiration of OPT, his wife/girlfriend usually has to go with him, vice versa. So the country is facing with the loss of double amount of employees even their spouses have a legal status of staying. 

In a word, the extension will benefit not only the international students but also the whole country, without major impacts on the citizens. I totally vote for the pass of the proposal!
