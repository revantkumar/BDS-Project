OPT extension is a very good decision taken in favor of F1 students. The extension allows student to work for a longer time which will help the students in recovering the amount invested in their graduate program as well as gain expertise in various field. This will help the careers of the students as they can take back this knowledge back to their country or any other part of the world and have great career prospects.
OPT period also gives employers enough time to evaluate a candidate and if they like that person they can file the visa papers for them. And lets not forget that foreign workers also contribute a huge amount of taxes to government and US don't really have enough workers to take jobs in the IT industry.
