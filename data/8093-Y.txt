Yucheng Liu I support the OPT extension for three reasons: 1. International students in STEM majors are a very important work force for both big companies and start-up in CS, EE, ME. Not only are these companies developing cutting-edge technology that power the economy of the states, they also create thousands of work opportunities for US citizens. 2. International students help improve the salary and wages for STEM jobs. While some people might argue the opposite, I witness the rising of annual salaries of entry level CS jobs in the bay area from 7-80k to 10-12k and even more if counting RSU. This is because of the booming of technology which is impossible without the sustained input from international students. 3. OPT extension gives the STEM students a better chance to learn and improve themselves with more practical training in the world's first-class industry environment. When they go back to their countries, they have better chance to grow and thrive and even build their own business. Because of their experience and connections in the US, they are potentially a very valuable resources for US based companies planning to expand the overseas business. In summary, I don't see any downsides of OPT extension like some people would argue.
