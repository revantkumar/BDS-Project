I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. Foreign students are already taken opportunities from the American students regarding college enrollments with cheating SAT scores. Even those with high TOEFL scores can't articulate their themseleves clearly. Now, with the extended OPT program, employees have more incentives and interests in hiring foreign students over Americans. American students will face the challenges of not getting a full-time job and carry their student loans all along. When promoting opportunities for foreign students, please be considerate of this country's lawful citizens.
