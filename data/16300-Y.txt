Many foreign students are self funded for their degree, but they don't have enough time to find a job! They spend a lot of time to adapt and study.After 2 years of effort, it's time for them to find a job, but the time left is really short. More and more students go back to their homes without experience in working, the degree is not that valuable because they cannot find a job. Furthermore, people will realize even if you invest in education, you have a little chance to get the money back. Fewer students will come to get a degree. So give them a little more time to find a job.
