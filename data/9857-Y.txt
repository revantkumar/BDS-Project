Cho Lu (2nd Comment) I think the OPT STEM Extension should be extended for 3 more years, resulted in a total 6 years period of time. I recommend this time period because the nature of the work of the STEM students, especially students in the Engineering field. For example, students who work in Civil/Environmental/Electrical/Mechanical Engineering industry, will often be involved in projects that need years to be completed. In most cases the students' participation in these projects will be required from the initial design phase to the construction/execution phase as well as the measurement and verification phase. It's very common that a construction project will take 10 years to be completed. 3 years is far from enough for students to gain meaningful experience, achieve actual real results and make real contribution to the companies/organizations; since the initial training would take up a long time. It will be a waste of resource and time for both the companies and students if the students have to leave when the project just started and the students just have gotten familiar with the industry and the operations of the companies. The short of enough practice time is also a factor that lower the competitiveness of international students in the job market, since the employer would not want to invest in training employees that only have very limited amount of time here in the companies. To conclude, in order to achieve the the goal of OPT - giving international students the opportunities to gain real, meaningful, valuable training experience as well as bringing actual benefit to the U.S. companies, I think OPT for STEM students should be extended for 3 more extra years, making a total 6 years training period.
