I STRONGLY SUPPORT this program. 

1) I am a student with STEM degree. We got 8 Ph.D students in my lab and 7 of them are not US citizen. Foreign students are an important part in STEM field and without them, it will influence the development of the science and technology industry in US. 
2) We are NOT asking for a places in the job market over US students. Everyone is COMPLETELY EQUAL in this competition. This program just gives all the F-1 students a little bit more time to prove themselves because we have to admit that 12 months is not long enough for an entry-level graduate student to find the position in their careers.

Above all, foreign students are an important part in STEM field in US and 12 months OPT is not long enough for fresh graduate students to prove themselves. Therefore, this expanding program is a very good proposal, not only for the students, but also for the development of technology in US.
