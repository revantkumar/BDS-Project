Dear sir, 

I fully support the proposed changes. But it is unfair to reject visas to many people with excellent record and full funding using provisions of 214.b. which states a person has to convince visa officer he would return to his home country. But once these students are in US, govt is encouraging them to apply for permanent residency with all kinds of rules etc.

The first change you have to implement is, make f-1 visa a dual intent with regulation like it has been done for P and O visas. It should be clearly mentioned in FAM guidelines that those who obtain admission in masters or phd with tuition waiver or full funding or phd in all major universities should not be refused f-1 visas on the basis of outdated 214b regulations. As already every one including the congress,senate etc have unanimously accepted that Dual intent should be extended to f-1 visas and f-1 should be considered on par with h-1 and l-1 visas as per many legislations that have been brought to flloor and voted overwhelmingly in senate and house (but separately).

my suggestion is to update FAM for f-1 visa with clear guidelines for visa officers with instructions about when a f-1 visa applicant with good academic record ,test scores with admission at a university approved by DHS shouldn't be refused a visas on the basis of 214b.
