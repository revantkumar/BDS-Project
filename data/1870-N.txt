This is stupid. As a technical professional I have seen many degreed Americans unable to obtain jobs,especially because companies replace them with immigrants with H and OPT visas. The H and OPT visas should be eliminated not expanded. Allowing more of these people to come or stay here and take jobs away from American citizens is harmful to the interests of the American pople.
