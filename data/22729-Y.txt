The OPT extension is really necessary. For years, the US is the most popular country for international students with STEM majors to get the advanced degrees. They can be the potential talents to make contribution in the scientific research as well as high-tech industry. We can still find a great number of famous scientists in the US who used to be international scholars. And it's for sure all these STEM graduate students have to seek for jobs in other countries because they lose the working experience in the US as the consequence of the OPT extension is denied.
As some comments mentioned that these international students would be competitive with the native american citizens and further increase the unemployment. However, it must be realised that the unemployment is the result of the economy, which can be highly promoted by high-tech industry and outstanding academic achievement. Unfortunately, there is still limited number of US citizens acquiring the advanced degrees in STEM majors and hired by these specific positions. The OPT can only provides the opportunities to offer specific positions to international students directly related to their majors, which indicates the competition from international students actually has very little negative impact to US employment. The efforts they make in these positions will be a great chance for the industrial development, that is helpful to decrease the domestic unemployment.
