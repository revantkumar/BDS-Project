I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international master student from China. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my master degree in US, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and British. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it it's definitely a huge disaster to Universities. Besides that it's a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies as well, like Google, Apple, because they are supported by foreign STEM talents.
