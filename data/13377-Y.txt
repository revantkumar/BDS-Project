Hi

I support extending OPT 24 more months.

I am a computer science master graduated from NYU.
Currently I am looking for jobs.
Now my OPT only remains 7 months. I think the time is very limited for me if I don't have more time.

I think I am a pretty excellent student. But When some company heard of the remain time of my OPT is only 7 months during the interview, they don't hire me. Because they think I can only work 7 months or less for them. It is not worth to cultivate me.

What a terrible thing both for us! The company loses a person who can devote themself to the company. And also I loses chances to find a job and earn money.

So, extending OPT is very important for companies and me. I just want to work the US company.

Thanks,
