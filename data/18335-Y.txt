As an international statistics graduate student from China I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. Before I came to US I had several options to pursue my master degree in US, Canada, Australia, Hong Kong and UK. The most important reason I chose the US was that I could get industry training opportunities while at school or after graduation. So OPT extension plays a very important role in the process, as I major in math. Without this OPT extension policy, The US could not have been attracting so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge and passion to this country, and I probably would have chosen to study in another country with better policies. If this rule is terminated for some reason, it's definitely a disaster to most IT based companies, for example Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. They are strongly supported by foreign STEM students. 

12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also necessary for OPT. Based on my previous work experience, most research/software development projects would last at least 2 years, sometimes even more. If the OPT extension is shortened, foreign STEM workers on those projects would lose their VISA before the projects completed.

The OPT extension is definitely necessary and benefits the United States even more than STEM students themselves.
