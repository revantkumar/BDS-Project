Adam Hart If this rule is issued then international stdents will stayin USA for longer time and they may start their own enterprises in USA with ideas and experience they have accumulated from around the world. This rule is not taking away any job from us. In fact because of this rule more and more jobs are being created for American citizen with or without degree in STEM field. STEM graduates are creating more and more jobs for everyone. Diversity is what makes this country the best country in the world. If this rule is not issued then I think we are going to loose our identity.
