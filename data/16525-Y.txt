I think this is a great rule for providing an equal opportunity for international students to work in the US after getting their study. I've been in contacting some international students as their host family in the US, working with the university for the past several years. According to my experience, I feel like these young people are very motivated and smart and would like to continue work in this country after their study. I definitely agree with the newly proposed rule.
