I'm a Electrical Engineer as well as an graduated student from UCLA and currently work in OPT status for Google. I do not know why so many people worried about our international students will rob American students' jobs. According to my experience, I also have a lot native students as very good friends, we studied together, did projects together, attended discussion together. I'm 100% sure they do not worried about their friends from different countries will make them unemployed. All of us worked really hard in school, everyone is equal. Finding a job is based on GPA and interview performance, but not nationality.

And for my understanding, 90% or above international students willing to go back to their motherland, what they want is some industry experience. Take myself as an example, my manager, who is American, sometimes make fun of me that "Is that true every student in your country all as smart as you?" I know it's a joke but I can see big companies in USA are very welcome of OPT students and suddenly cut the program will definitely make the economic even worse than before. 

So, please pass this bill regards of the whole country's economy and development of technician. 

Thank you very much.
