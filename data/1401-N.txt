The proposed rule will lessen the job prospects of recent American STEM graduates.

Expanding OPT eligibility to three years after graduation will increase the labor pool for American tech jobs by hundreds of thousands of recent graduates. That alone will adversely affect job opportunities and wages for all college graduates precisely at a time when there is a shortage of high-wage jobs for college graduates, many of whom struggle to make payments on college loans.

OPT provides significant financial incentives for companies to bypass American workers.

If wages rise for STEM graduates, then more U.S. students will pursue those careers. And it is vital for the U.S. to have a robust resident STEM workforce.
