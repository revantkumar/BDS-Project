I support the OPT extension.
For those of you who don't really understand what OPT is, OPT is for legal international student to get a chance to do a internship or work in their field of study, NOT for illegal immigrants. No special benefits were ever granted to any OPT student other than a work permit in their field. If OPT extension or OPT is cancelled, in the future years the number of international students will dramatically decrease which would lead to a higher tuition for domestic students. Companies will not have a chance to hire those gifted students. And at the same time, those talented students who were educated in the U.S will have to go back and work for their country and finally compete with our America.
