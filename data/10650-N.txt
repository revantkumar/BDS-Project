It is time to stop putting the welfare of immigrants over that of Americans. It is blatantly obvious that the 'establishment' wants to drive down the cost of labor. With the help of our corporate-run government, this effort has been widely succeeding for decades to the detriment of the American Worker. Our standard of living and the real wage is in a long-term decline. When will elected officials begin representing the voters that elected them? Americans?
Stop Corporate Greed.
