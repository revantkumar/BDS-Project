I support this improvement on OPT for STEM students. I was a STEM foreign student. Although I gained my work authorization through family, I have had the experience with the policy. I understand that the expanding of OPT for F-1 students should not affect any employment for citizens and residents because by law foreign students will only be employed if there are no citizens or residents capable for the job. Also, this policy can give companies more opportunities to hire the most suitable employees and therefore develop more. This can help with the economy of the whole country. United States has a long history of immigration, and immigrants are still a strong force of economic growth. Besides, look at those European countries, they don't have programs like OPT, but they don't have better employing rates or are wealthier.
