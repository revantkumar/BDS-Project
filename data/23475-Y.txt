As the trend shows, STEM students have contributed to the US economies a lot during the past years. I am a student whose major is computer science. During the past summer, I was interned in a big tech companies. I encountered with many capable interns and full-time workers. We all came from different backgrounds, majored in STEM fields and would love to contribute U.S with the knowledge we had learned. Many of the STEM students were assigned with important roles in their jobs and devoted essential contribution to the development of the companies. We definitely appreciate that U.S government provides us one year of OPT training, but at least for tech industry, one year is too short to make big contribution and development. I believe that with a 24 months extension, STEM students can bring better results and the companies can really benefit from their contributions.
