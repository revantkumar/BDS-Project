I strongly SUPPORTthe OPT extension proposal for the following reasons:

1.To let students who learn from U.S. universities to contribute the U.S. will have improvement on the U.S development, no matter on technology or other aspect. 

2. Diversity of culture and background is very important for the U.S, we can see how big contribute the international students made to the U.S., many top scientist and CEO, especially in the technology area were not U.S. citizen.

3. The exist of competition is not a bad thing. These talent student can be shining in everywhere, hold them in U.S. is a good way to make U.S. stronger, otherwise, if they go to other country, they will be strong competition to U.S companies. 

As to the competition between U.S. citizen and international students, it's not international students use lower wages strategy to steal the job of native students, instead, these positions need the international students, there are not enough native students suit those jobs. Besides, this kind of competition can help U.S. select better talented person, so that improve the power of U.S.
