I'm a postdoctoral researcher at MIT under OPT and I strongly support OPT and its extension. There are hundreds of scholars are using OPT at MIT and thousands could be potentially affected in the future. In our lab, we are mostly non-US citizens, we all need OPT to work. We work day and night to promote research to revolutionize our life. We have been developing tools for noninvasive diabete monitoring and cancer studies to save our lives. Transforming research into technology, we have formed a dozen of companies and provided jobs for Americans and stimulated local economies. We are not grabbing Americans' jobs. However, we are now facing threatening and may even lose our work permissions. This is vicious discrimination. Therefore, I urge the government to pass this OPT rule promptly to avoid significant losses to the country.
