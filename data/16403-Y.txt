Expanding OPT to 36 months for STEM students is a good improvement to the current OPT regulation. As a result, multiple interest groups will benefit from this.

1. U.S. industrial companies: as is know to all, the companies have a high demand for talents with STEM skills and knowledge to satisfy their needs. On the other hand, native students can not fill up the gap between the needs and provision. Therefore, given more opportunities to recruit more STEM students, U.S. companies will be more competitive in the world market, instead of watching these talents flowing to other countries.

2. U.S. educational institutions nowadays rely hugely on foreign talents and tuitions to keep their leading status over the world. If OPT, as a great beneficial part of attractions for foreign students, is shortened or even revoked, U.S. educational will probably lose, or at least be cut down such a great resource of talents and money. Please be aware that education is fundamentally the reason why U.S. dominates the world.

3. Admittedly, bringing more foreign talents will more or less intensify the competence in the U.S.. However, in such a globalized industrial market, especially on science, technology, it is inevitable to dive deep into the process of globalization if you want to keep the dominating status in the world. Engineers, scientists in U.S. will in the long run benefit from this by keeping their competitiveness.
