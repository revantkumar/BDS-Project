I strongly support the proposal. 

As a chemical engineering phd student who is doing research on process design for biomass conversion to transportation liquid fuels, I am sure I can help the energy development in U.S. if STEM OPT extension is expanded to 24 months. From the data of U.S. EIA (Energy Information Administration), the reserve of petroleum in U.S. 33.403 billion barrels. And the consumption in U.S. for petroleum is 18,961.1 thousand barrels per day according to the 2013 consumption rate. This reserve can only be used for 5 years. So now U.S. relies on the import of oil to support the energy use. However, U.S. has a huge amount of land, which means there is a lot of biomass resources. Biomass as energy source is renewable and sustainable, because the CO2 from biomass to fuels will be used again for the biomass growth through photosynthesis. The huge amount of biomass can solve the energy shortage crisis in U.S.. Then U.S. won't rely on the import of energy. This will be very economic for the development of U.S. economy. The scale-up of biomass still needs more research to make it cost competitive. I am sure the use of biomass as energy source to liquid transportation fuels can't be done in one year. The extension of STEM OPT to 24 months can definitely help U.S. about this. Therefore, I strongly support this proposal. I am sure this is a wise decision. It will definitely accelerate the economic development of U.S..
