I fully support and request US government to extend OPT to 36 months, and ensure the legality and quality of STEM international students.

On the one hand, only those who would make contribution to US want to work here, and they bring huge benefits. First, they can enhance the productivity of industry in America, because of good education they get. Also, students could increase tax, which is beneficial to citizens.

As for the pressure they exert on US students, I want you to know: US is aimed to include excellent individuals, not domestic ones.
