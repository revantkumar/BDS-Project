STEM Extension is one of the most importance reasons that U.S. academic sector can remain competitive globally and stay attractive to outstanding foreign students. International students are making huge impacts and contributions to US, in terms of both payment of tuition and enhancing academic discourse and cultural exchange on campuses and companies. 

I do not believe STEM Extension is taking opportunities from U.S. STEM workers. Foreign students are bring opportunities to local economy and industry with their personal expenditure, and job opportunities they are bringing to U.S. job market. Rejecting STEM Extension would gain people a illusive or false relief that there are temporarily fewer competitors in the job market, but losing long-term benefits that would cause the US to lose ground to the countries that welcome these students.
