As a single mother supporting my child under OPT employment, this proposed rule will be life-saving. My household relies heavily on only my income, for medical expenses, education, living expenditures, and so on. Losing OPT means losing financial support for us. 
As a scholar, I believe is is a great initiative to improve both the academic-professional experience for international students and the technology based US economy. If implemented, this new practice will enhance the entire process from university STEM program recruiting, students' study and research at school, to students practicing their knowledge in the industries or professional organizations. This is a well-thought proposal which is beneficial to all parties.
