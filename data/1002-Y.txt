I strongly support the 24 month extension. Apparently this seems to be a rule favours foreign holders. In fact it will bring great benefits to US.

If we consider graduate education as an investment, we definitely hope the best masters and doctors graduated continue their career and make contribution to US. This is the best benefit we expect from eduction. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, international students make up more than half of STEM advanced degrees earned at US colleges and universities, respectively 57% of all engineering doctoral degrees, 53% of all computer and information sciences doctoral degrees and 50% of mathematics and statistics doctoral degrees. To let the best foreign talents contribute to US, DHS need to grant them H1B visa. The amount of H1B visa every year is highly limited. There are advanced degree holders which are needed by US companies but cannot be granted H1B visa within one year. The OPT extension enable them to contribute to US while waiting for their H1B visa.

(Note that the limited amount of H1B visa is a protection of US citizens from competition of foreign workforce. US citizens need not to worry whether there will be less job opportunities resulting from hiring foreigners. Most job position are accessible to US citizens.)

US can develop into such a strong country because of its diversity. The first nuclear boom, the silicon valley and the Hollywood, etc are all built by the combined effort from both US and international talents. US also has the best education in the world, where a large number of professors were international STEM students before. Diversity is and will always be the root of America's development. The extension of OPT is also a way to maintain the diversity of workforce in US. This definitely is going to benefit US.
