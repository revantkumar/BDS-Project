It is great opportunity for students. (Non immigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief ) However, this program is being misused by both the students and the employers more specific staffing firms. Most of the jobs non-immigrant students end up taking are in information technology. I have personally seen that their basic education and master's program has no direct correlation to the job that they perform. They get trained on information technology skill based tools manipulate the resume and get the job. I have seen instances of students showing 7 plus years as experience when they have actually gone to school in the period. My logic's define that the rightful student playing by the rule book is deprived of a job. One can just search Dice.com, monster.com,indeed.com and see this OPT student's profiles and the company's marketing; the rates per hour are mind blowing. The start up salary is upwards of 70,000 per annul. Second the social security and Medicare taxes are exempted for the students this is also unfair. A typical American student would accomplish his master program with upwards of $100,000 in education expenses. Whereas the international student would have spent around $30,000 for the master program. I feel the Cap-gap Relief needs better statutory law defined with regulatory or administrative control by the department of labor and immigration.
