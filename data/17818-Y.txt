I believe extending the OPT to 24 months is a great idea. We have come here for the education and to make our career. When we came, we came here with the hope that the OPT extension of 17 months will still be there and will be kept. Extending it to 24 months is not a problem, removing it completely is in fact a problem. We have loans, our all family savings that goes into the education. If most of us had known that there is a possibility that OPT extension will be removed, I believe the number of people/student travelling will be reduced and thus nobody will want to risk there lives.

This might seem to be normal for many residents, but indeed it is not. 

I strongly support and in favor of getting the OPT extended to 24 months.
