Of course I DO STRONGLY SUPPORT this proposal. 

It is the BEST for the United States since a lot of foreign workers have contributed so much to this great country and we should let them get chances to make more contributions. And this country is so great because of its spirit that everyone gets equal opportunities. And this country is so powerful and advanced because of its great heart of taking people from all other countries. 

So please do pass this proposal!! Thanks!
