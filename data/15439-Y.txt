As a current international student, I strongly SUPPORT the OPT extension proposal for the reasons below:

1.Education in United States is attractive partly because it has a OPT training program. With an OPT extension rule, student can get more time on training which will increase their interesting to attend U.S. universities. Some non-stem students even consider to apply another STEM program to get OPT extension.
2.STEM programs are the areas that lack of people to working in. If this area already has enough domestic workers to working in, it wont become STEM at all.
3.Countries like Canada, Netherland, Singapore all came up with some very benefit rule to attract students of work in their countries. Consider birth rate is pretty low among the world now, cancel the OPT extension will hugely hurt the economy of U.S.
4.It is not true to say companies will hire unqualified international students due to lower salary. E-verify program is generated to make sure that. OPT extension will only apply to E-verify company. 
5.Considering H1B is very hard to draw, cancel OPT extension will result in a disaster in company. Could you image an under developing project suddenly lose its developer? Company will spend a lot of effort to find a new developer and waste a long time until the new developer can understand the previous code.
