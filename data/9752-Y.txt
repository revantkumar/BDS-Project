I strong SUPPORT the proposal for the following reason:

This proposal would make US a more attractive country for international student for study in.And those student would make huge economical contribution to this country. For instance, I've been studying in US for 1 year and a half, and I've spend more than $55,000. Apart from paying for the tuition, international student will also spend money on food, house rent, entertainment(I spend $5000 on travel across US and $1780 on mountain biking),cars(40% of my friend has their own cars) and so on. All of these expense from international students are strong support for local economy. I study in ASU, and 10% of total students are international students. It's hard to imagine what our the local community would be like if there are no international student. BUT if this proposal is failed, US would be less attractive and people would choose to study in other country(like Australia and Germany). As far as I know, the reason most student in China choose to study in US because of the opt.If the international student in US is largely reduced, those economical benefit would be greatly impaired.
