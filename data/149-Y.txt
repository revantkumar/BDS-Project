I am an international STEM graduate majored in Information Technology Management. My employer is one of the biggest tile manufacturer in the U.S. (Fortune 500 company)

My company took over a Chinese manufacturer company, therefore, they would like to training several bilingual candidates and send them to China as management level who directly report to the U.S. headquarter.

I was selected as a of these candidates in the training program. One of the basic reason, is my 17 month STEM OPT extension provides me enough work authorization in the U.S. after graduation. Now, my company has trained me more than 1 year in the half way and was notified the 17 month OPT extension will be ended begin Feb. 16, 2016. It just waste time and money for both my employer and myself. What it happens to me, just like a grocery store advised buy one get one for free and after the customer bought one, the grocery store told the customer sorry, because of some of our inner management issue, we cannot offer your another one for free.

Therefore, the new rule should at least remain 17 month of OPT extension. 17 month of OPT is a promise the U.S. made to employers and international students in recent 5 years. If the U.S. want to invalidate this rule, it should give a notice right now, and take affection 5 years later.
