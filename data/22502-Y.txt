Expanding the STEM OPT is a good idea and I don't see a reason to stick against it.
1. The STEM OPT is for HIGHLY EDUCATED STEM students and they are not taking jobs from Americans WITH THE SAME EDUCATION AND SKILLS. US is still IN NEED of STEM workers, just check 'http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/09/15/the-stem-worker-shortage-is-real'! STEM workers are not taking job from Americans, they are helping the unemployed by boosting the economy and create more jobs for them.
2. OPT workers do pay taxes, and receive little benefits from them. US and US citizens are enjoying the benefits brought by non-immigrant STEM OPT workers.
3. Expanding the STEM OPT shows gesture that US is open to the talents around the world. Countless ground breaking innovations were done by international scholars and more will come by showing the gesture to the world.
