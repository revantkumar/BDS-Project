I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

Firstly, it is unjust to deprive international students legal right to work only based on their citizenship. Everyone should enjoy his/her given right to work regardless of gender, race, ethnicity and citizenship. 

Secondly, international students are making huge contributions in U.S. Most of the international students work in the STEM field, which is critical for U.S. to continue its leadership in the world.

Rejecting international students would lead to a short-term benefit in temporarily lower the competition in the job market. However, this short-term benefit can be offset by long-term consequences. International students may choose to go to other countries that are friendlier in accepting them, and they will serve for those countries in basic research, engineering, entrepreneurship and other fields that help empower and create jobs.
