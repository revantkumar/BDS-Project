I absolutely SUPPORT the proposal. The U.S. is the greatest nation on the earth because of its welcomeness to the most talented people from all around the world. Allowing international students to prosper will benefit the US in the long term. Those who oppose this proposal are just short sighted and only care about their own benefit, sacrificing the potential of the nation. 

Kicking out international students from the nation is only contributing to the competitors of the U.S.: Europe, China, India, etc. Being exclusive is sacrificing the future of the U.S.
