I support this rule, I think it is a great opportunity for the F-1 students to gain some work experience. 

As countries such as China, Korea, Japan are developing fast, many students from these countries will go back after they complete the degree or finish OPT program. OPT program help them to get work experience in U.S. companies and get better jobs when they return to their home country.
