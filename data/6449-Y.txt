Siyao Luan, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign I would put my comment short and concise: I like this country and wants to stay here for work. I love the people and hold so dear the opportunity to realize my dream of becoming an excellent engineer in the country with the most advanced industries. This extension of the training opportunities will significantly increase my chance of remaining in this country so as to be one huge step closer to my dream. I definitely vote for this proposal with no hesitation. I want to stay and work here because I want to, together with American citizens, make the USA a better place.
