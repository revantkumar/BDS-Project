Strong support!

High-tech industry is more an international business compared with other industries because that is the essence of Internet! If you cannot keep your talents, of course the business will move to places with enough talents. The current situation is that U.S. needs more STEM workers. While education is the final way out of this "talent crisis", keeping these qualified students here will help U.S. keep the dominate position in this business in short term. 

Simple fact: short of STEM workers + not enough qualified domestic workers + don`t want to lose the business -> keep STEM student for now until the education system can produce enough domestic workers
