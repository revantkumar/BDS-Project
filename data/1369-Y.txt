Hello,

I agree with most of the proposed rule except one thing. The definition of STEM should include all the sciences degree/science applying majors, including the Medical science field like laboratory tech, Medical science degree like Bachelor of Sciences in Nursing, Public Health Sciences programs like Epidemiology, as far as they followed a science degree curriculum. 

All these medical/health-science related programs provide education of applicable sciences and research science education at the same time. It is not fair for these graduates from high quality programs in Bachelor of Science/Master of Science/or Even Ph.D. degrees, who learned a similar curriculum doing similar job but not treated the same opportunity. Some of them are even short of graduates for sure like the nursing.

Please considering including all Science (Curriculum) Degrees into the STEM definition.
