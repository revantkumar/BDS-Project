I wholly support this decision of the US Government to improve upon the OPT STEM extension. Not only does the 24 month extension make the process of obtaining a H-1B Visa much more stress-free than with the 12 month extension, but it also encourages every student to join a relatively smaller company that might not sponsor visas for international students but still does progressive work that the student loves. The Cap-Gap relief clause is another such measure that will have the same effect.

As an international student already burdened by a large loan that I undertook in my home country of India, the uncertainty and monetary expenditure associated with the process of obtaining a H-1B visa is another issue that bears down upon me all the time. I feel that, with a 24 month extension, I will be able to live a happier life and contribute to the welfare of this great country.
