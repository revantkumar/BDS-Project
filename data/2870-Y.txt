I would definitely agree with this rule. 

United States is a diverse country. It becomes a well-developed country because of the great effort made by both native people and people from other countries. 

Expanding OPT is a win-win decision for international STEM students and for this country. 

F-1 students can work longer in U.S., which means they can have more time to familiar with the way working with American colleagues. After they come back to their countries, they can serve the global companies better. Everything is becoming globalized. So do our human beings.

In terms of U.S., F-1 STEM students devote their knowledge and skills to this country and make this country prosperous. Particularly in Computer Science, engineering, and statistics areas, the majority of international students can do their jobs very well. American need young workforce!

Some one might objects that expanding OPT will take Americans jobs. I do not think so. Everyone should have equal opportunities to get jobs. If you work hard and if you are excellent, you would never worry someone taking your job! I wish everyone can realize one thing, that is, you can get a job because of your capability for work, rather than because of your nationality.
