Jie Li 36 months OPT will be beneficial to US staying in the first place. This is the right regulation to hold the best people worldwide and prevent talents leaking outside US. Fortune 500 companies all desperately need those highly educated nternational students to help them staying in unbeatable place. During the past few years, US has already experienced international talents loss and US economy has already suffered from it. Looking at semiconductor industry, IBM already fall down; Intel is facing 14nm technology challenge from Samsung (Korea) and TSMC (China) and will be behind if further talents are leaving. Same for Internet companies. Look at Google and Facebook, their technologies are no longer cutting edge, more and more passionated young people are leaving for Alibaba and Tecent. If they leave now, they will never come back. Longer term OPT will offer US companies to hold the best young people.
