Dear Mr. Johnson:

I write to you regarding the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. I am a graduate international student Naga Pradeep Gajula at the University of Denver (DU). 35% of DU graduate students are international students and a vast majority of those are in the United States on F-1 visas. I and many of my colleagues will be strongly affected by the Proposed Rule.

I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I'm particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months.
I am planning to use OPT after graduation to gain practical training experience in the US because, it helps me to get habituted with the US based companies and lets me to get exposed for working environment.
OPT and OPT extension is important to me because, this periods allows me to enhance my knowledge without any pressures as it is considered as my training period.
I am very concerned with the possibility that the ability of students to make use of the STEM OPT Extension might be disrupted by recent court actions, upcoming court actions, and delays in this rulemaking process. I commend DHS for working quickly to prepare this new Proposed Rule.

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule and I am really very thankful for all of your hard work in keeping America safe and providing educational and training opportunities to F-1 students.

Best regards,

Naga Pradeep Gajula
