This is exactly what we need. Much like senator Marco Rubio's plan of increasing H1B visa numbers to allow more educated, talented young graduates to work in America leagally, the Training Opportunities for nonimmigrant students offers many foreign students to temporarily work in the US. The STEM extension allows us to attract more young talent to study and work in America, the students who benifit from this policy will also generate lots of revenue, stimulate local economy and help bringing high tech companies and jobs back to America. We need the high tech business to come back to the US, because if we are not attracting all the talent from the world, they are just going to benefit other countries.
