OPT is very important for international students gaining more skills and experience in their majors related fields. As a student who has earned a Bachelor's degree in Biochemistry, I appreciate that I have OPT to do volunteering at school labs as well as internship at great institutes and currently work at a research lab. For students, OPT extension will provide us longer time to learn at work. It also benefits employers to have less stress helping those who are doing fantastic job to obtain working VISAs since they can work longer under OPT. 
Personally, I find my interests of study during my OPT that I have interned at a worldwide well-known institute. They only provide working VISA to people who have PhD. It was also a inspiration beside my interests in scientific research to me to pursue a PhD. Then, I'm preparing my graduate school applications now.
All in all, extending OPT will largely benefit both students and employers.
