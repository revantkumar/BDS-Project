Im a Chinese citizen currently working in a biotech company in the SF Bay Area on the F-1 OPT extension. I got my PhD degree in Biology from a top 10 university in the US and started working on F-1 OPT last year. I guess I might represent the group of people who benefit most from the proposed new rules, but here Id like to remind everybody that giving us more time/opportunities to stay and work here benefit the US society overall.
Most foreign PhDs in STEM were sponsored by federal funds such as NIH or NSF. After 5-7 years of training they finally become skilled researchers/workers, managed to graduate, find a quite decent job somewhere and start to PAY TAXES. They are likely in their most creative and productive ages (25-40 year old). Historically, new immigrants are a strong force that keep USA so strong, creative and attractive. 
An extended OPT will have us make more informed decisions about to stay or to return, and more importantly, a smoother transition between student visa and work visa. Thats why Im fully support this new policy.
