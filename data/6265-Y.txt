The US is an immigration based country. It is strong because it welcomes talented people from all over the world. This is the basis of the US. The money in the US is never easy to gain and only the well qualified person can get the opportunity. This is also the aspect that attracts bright people from other countries. 

I faced lots of discriminations when I applied for jobs, simply because I am not an American. All of the companies I know are already giving priorities to Americans. But companies are willing to spend more money (I was told in order to hire international people, they need to spend more money for immigration fair, and my salary is the same as the US workers in the same level. So, I don't understand why so many people say international employees are cheaper.) to hire a more qualified person. This is not unfair. This is how a healthy society should look like.
