I strongly support the proposal, and I provide the reasons below:

(1) The US government has shared valuable education resources with the international students, and now it is the time for those international students to make contributions to the US economy development. Without the proposal approved, the US government will lose so many talented students which could lead to potential economy loss.

(2) International students are NOT STEALING the job opportunities. Instead, they COMPETE with local citizens to find a job, which is a good thing because everyone, either international students or local citizen, can become competitive. We all know that competitive job candidates will boost the job market, and even the US economy.

All in all, there's no harm for this proposal to be approved.
