We do need the Opt extension to allow our international employee stay in the states and support them making contributions. And with their contribution our economy and technology are able to growwhich in returnbring more jobs to us. 

And speaking of the bad partI think International students have nearly nothing to do with the minimum wage. If you are an international student working on OPT and you need to apply for the H1B visayour income must meet the minimum salary standardwhich is actually much higher than the minimum income required by any states. I should say this should be unreasonable if it is the reason to ask people leave.
