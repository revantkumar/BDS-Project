Cath Hazard To those who is shouting on this web to object the extension:

Stop complaining about the STEM squeezing locals out of the job market! Employers are NOT charity, they have no obligation to provide jobs to those who are not capable to the position but are only citizens! If you want a job, READ your textbooks and WORK as half diligently as the international students!

Also, if you are being afraid that international students will be detriment for the social security, stop worrying about that. You should worry about the poverty in the US now, as it is the main detriment for homeland security, not well educated international STUDENTS! At least those that I have met, they are hard working and polite. Also, STEM industries are the main drivers of the US GDP. If not provide opportunities for STEM students to serve the industry, what do you want to end up with when STEM industry shrinks, and the States is beaten by other competing countries in the world?

STUPID!
