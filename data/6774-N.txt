A program that gives INCENTIVES to employers to hire foreign students here on visas over un/underemployed Americans? Really? Where's the common sense in that? Hiring Americans should always come first and our government should be forcing these companies to hire un/underemployed Americans instead of giving incentives to these companies to hire nonAmericans.
