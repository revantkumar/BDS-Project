I strongly support the OPT extension program. For one thing, this policy would attract thousands of talented students from all over the world to study and work in America, which would definitely boost US's economy as it has done for the past years. Also, by reading through some of the negative comments, I find their reason of opposing this policy by saying that it would make American citizens hard to find jobs is not sound. IT companies hire a lot of foreign students not because they don't want to hire citizens, but because they can not find enough competent candidates from only the citizens. I can't think of any reason for a company to hire a foreigner, for whom it has to pay a lot more to maintain legal status, than to hire a citizen if they are equally competent. So, it's not the foreign students' fault that some Americans can not find jobs. You just need to be competent!
