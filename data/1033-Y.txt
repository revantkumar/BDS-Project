I do support this rule!
If this rule cannot pass, the attraction of international students to US would decrease a lot. As a result, lots of students would go to other countries, like Europe, Australia or Asian top universities. Lots of talents would leave United States and go to other countries. As the largest immigrant country, this rule is an important one to attract talents here.
