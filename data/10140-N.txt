H1B and OPT are being widely abused by corporations for one reason only,to save money on payroll. US STEM workers are being undercut by corporate desire to increase profits at any cost.The US Treasury loses billions in revenue from lost FICA and Medicare taxes which hurts the general population while benefitting tech companies.There is no shortage of qualified US STEM workers .Loopholes and lax enforcement allow rampant abuse of H1B and OPT by companies wishing to save tens of thousadnds of dollars per employee by casting aside experienced US STEM workers for foreign trainees.
