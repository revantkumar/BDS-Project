I am an International Student who will be impacted by the ruling of this law. Having said that, just because I am international, I am siding with the STEM extension won't be the right argument. I agree law-makers want to avoid illegal immigration and keep infiltrators out. The STEM program however does not deal with illegal immigration. It is specifically for Internationals who come to the United States to make a career, put in their parents/family's lifelong earnings to get world-class education or even take up heavy student loans. The knowledge gained through college/graduate schools is being used to contribute to America's growing economy, it's diversity. This very pool has consistently helped America become a super power. These students are not looking at settling and migrating to America permanently. They are looking at getting a professional experience around their education and are then looking to return back to their home-countries. This law is hence catered to help students gain corporate American experience, reduce student loans and encourage innovation that can put America on the global map. All students irrespective of gender, nationality, race, cultural background, sexual preference should be provided with an equal opportunity to succeed. America has always stood for diversity and provides the best cultural concoction in the world. Abolishing this rule will make it very difficult for international students to come here. Many who come from countries that have a very low exchange rate.I hence strongly urge people to vote in favor of this ruling and support innovation, diversity and cultural harmony - Things that America has always guaranteed and stood for.

Thank you
