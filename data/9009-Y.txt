I support STEM extension. Besides, Industrial Organizational Psychology (CIP: 42.2804) should be added to the STEM list.

First, this specialty matches the definition of STEM. Industrial-organizational psychology is "characterized by the scientific study of human behavior in organizations and the work place." (American Psychological Association) It studies the science of behavior in the workplace and helps improve organizational effectiveness.

Second, it is the fastest-growing occupation in the U.S. according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). In 2014, BLS released its ranking of the 20 fastest-growing occupations in the U.S.. "Industrial-organizational psychologists" are coming in at #1, with median pay of $83,580 a year and a growth rate of 53 percent between now and 2022.

Third, many practitioners in this area are making great contributions to American society. For instance, the vice president of human resources at Tesla Motors was major in Industrial Organizational Psychology. He leads the entire HR team supporting this amazing electric vehicle company effectively.

Last, many researchers in this area contributes very much to the workplace. For example, a study completed at the Hawthorne Works in Cicero Illinois found that individuals tend to improve an aspect of their behavior in response to their awareness of being observed. This effect is named as "Hawthorne Effect", which helps millions of corporations in the world improve productivity.

In conclusion, it makes sense to add Industrial Organizational Psychology (CIP: 42.2804) to the STEM list.
