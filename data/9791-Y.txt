I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who studied at U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the country, especially for those student in STEM fields because of a shortage of technical personnel in U.S. 

2. Diversity is very important for U.S. companies. As we know, many corporations have a larger market share outside U.S., such as in Asia. The existence in diversity can make international cooperation and communications much easier. International students are able to connect U.S. companies with foreign companies well based on the advantage of language and culture.

3. Competitions among international and American students can help the country to select more talents and improve students comprehensive strengths all over the country so that U.S. still maintain the strongest talent competitiveness in the world.
