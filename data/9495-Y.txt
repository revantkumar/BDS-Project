Tongfang Sun Dear officer:
I am senior student in University of Washington. This is my last quarter as an undergraduate and I will start my full-time internship in the beginning of next year. I write this letter to ask for F-1 students' OPT extension from two aspects: myself situation and US company's situation.

As a foreign student, I feel very fortunate to have this remarkable opportunity to work in a US. startup company after finishing my graduating degree. I started this part time job in summer and I did feel that my technology skills improve a lot during this short intern term. Meanwhile, I also feel my shortages in some professional skills. I studied statistic and human computer interaction (HCI) in undergraduate and I was the only UX designer and front-end developer in our company. CS works are often required employees to spend 1 to 2 years in industry to accumulate experience. If I can spend more time on my work in OPT period, it will help me a lot in future work and study. Moreover, it does not only help me but help company to grow also. Generally, a tech company always need to spend 6 month on training a great employee and need to spend at least 2 years on training a man to be professional. If government cancel the OPT extension, it will cause Tech companies to loss many professional employees and leaders. 

Above all, I want to say that it is good proposal to improve and expand Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students both from students' and companies' future developments. Thank you very much for your consideration! Have a nice day!
Sincerely,
Tongfang Sun
