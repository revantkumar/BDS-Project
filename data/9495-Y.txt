As a US citizen, I think we do need these high tech workers. Without OPT, many of our tech companies have to move outside US to look for talents in China or India, which slashes our tax income for the government. As you probably know, many US companies are leaving our country and we need to stop the movement.

BTW, I am a big supporter for Donald Trump. If you want to make America great again, please also vote Donald trump! Only he dare talk about the truth!

Trump 2016!!!1
