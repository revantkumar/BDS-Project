Definitely SUPPORT this proposed rule! OPT has been one of the greatest advantage for foreign students to choose to study abroad in USA. Lack of this, it will have a big impact in US education on its diverse population, as well as its economy, since an important part of the universities' funding is coming from foreign students' tuition. It will make a big loss for many IT companies, too.
