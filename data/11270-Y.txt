I strongly support the proposal. 

International students have adapted to the American culture and obtained the capability to contribute to the society. Their talents boost the US economy and in turn create more job opportunities. However, nowadays the H1B lottery system is forcing these talents to leave the country. The reason for their leave is not related to their capability or the economical demands, but the work authorization. This is a big loss to the nation and its people. The extension of OPT could help keep these talented people continue to contribute to the society and create more opportunities to its people.

We all know that US is built by not only natives but also people from all over the world. By extending the OPT program, the US educational system could earn higher reputation and attract more and better international talents. In the end, these all contribute to the US and American people.
