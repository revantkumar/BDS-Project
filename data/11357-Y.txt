There would be at least 3 benefits that American citizens and the whole country could benefit from the STEM OPT extension.

First, it will continue boosting the high technology industries in US without doubts. As far as I know, many foreign graduate student comes to the Seattle, Silicon valley and Los Angeles to serve for the high technology company as soon as they graduate from US. universities. They are almost the top elites in their own country, if the extension could not be successfully done, a huge amount of these elites would have to go back to their own country and many big technology companies would suffer from the loss.

Second, comparing with the loss of job of American people, I would consider that the fierce competition from the foreign students will stimulate American students to work harder, which the whole US. will benefit from. The US, as the most powerful country in the world, should not tremble with wonderful people from all over the world. In the contrast, I think it would be the best opportunity to extend STEM OPT to whip native students and make them became elites too.

Last but not least, we do not rob USA. We are just here to serve the American people, that is the most important point of whole stuff. The software in your laptop , the smartphone you are using to talk with your family and friend, and even your blue tooth headphones, we made them for you, for the American citizens. I believe that anyone who are enjoying technology will not betray people who are behind these wonderful stuff.
