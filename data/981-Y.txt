I really appreciate your effort on improving and expanding training opportunities for F1 students with stem degrees. The admissions of US schools are very selective which ensures the quality of international students. International students with Math and Science degrees can contribute a lot to US society and create many more job opportunities for US citizens, for example the Google's new CEO Sundar Pichai. Thanks to OPT extension program, it allows Pichai to practice his expertises for Google and create a lot of innovations.

One thing I noticed is that the proposed OPT rule has a gray area. On October 6, 2013, USCIS issued a policy memorandum PM602-602-0090, which clarifies that F-1 students engaging in post-completion OPT under 8 CFR 214.2(f)(10)(ii)(A) are eligible for the 17-month STEM extension under 8 CFR 214.2(f)(10)(ii)(C) if they have not yet completed their thesis requirement or equivalent for their STEM degree when applying for the STEM extension. However there is no written updates on SEVIS yet. The SEVIS says before school staff makes a recommend for opt extension, he must make sure the student has already finished his thesis. USCIS policy and SEVIS conflicts with each other. To my understanding, these two departments are both under DHS. They should be consistent. I suggest that please clarify this issue in the new opt extension proposal.
