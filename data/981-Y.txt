Chang Yu I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.
International students provide high technology skills in high tech companies which improve the quality of people's life in U.S.
Due to the difficulty to get the H1 Visa, international students should have more time to adjust their career goals and given more opportunities to improve their skills. Only 12 months time is not enough for new grad students to really prepare for their future career.
