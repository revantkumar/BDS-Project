I strongly agree the proposal. First, the contribution to United States' economy made by a large number of international STEM students is tremendous. Just think about eventually, these students will become professionals and sometimes even the very top I n their fields. This is a huge potential for the economy developments. Second, most global companies strongly desire different cultures to be more innovative and creative. For this reason, allowing the F1 student more time in their occupitional practical training is also valuble for most US companies. Additionally, the statement of STEM extension causes the loss of jobs for other citizens is absolutely shortsighted. We all know job competition is always there. More than often, it is because no matched citizens would like to take the job. Repelling or rejecting STEM students may cost the long-term benefits of American people. Saying one day international students or talent people would lose the ground in US.All STEM students go back to their country or go to other welcoming countries if rejected by the US. What US lost, will not be just those students, is also the good scientific research and all the good promoters to the technology.
