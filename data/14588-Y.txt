I support this rule to expand OPT program. I understand many people would regard foreign students as a threat to local citizens in the working market, since when one offer is taken by a foreign student there seem one less opportunity left. But frankly we should put the whole picture into a large scale, long term perspective, especially for the technology world where the technology itself is the productivity. Expanding the OPT would make the talented foreign students stay in U.S. (otherwise, they may seek opportunities in other countries where the policy is more friendly) and put their talents into the tech companies, which will prosper the whole technology world and in turn create more jobs for both foreigners and local citizens. When something is beneficial to the society, it will ultimately benefits everyone.
