I support to improve and expand the STEM OPT time in order to give international students more opportunities and practice to adapt to the work environment of the United States, therefore, they can fully contribute to the work after the OPT period with high competence. 

When applying knowledge and skills learned from schools to real-world work problems, it needs time for international students to be trained to understand and fit in the new environment. A proper time period can provide them a deeper background in experience when stepping into work. And this strong background equips them with high competency to do tasks well in the work. When compare the time with the potential contribution, why don't we allow a time extension to get a more qualified employee? 

Furthermore, every talent person should have the same opportunity and treatment to work in their field. Nowadays, what we focus on should be developing more people with great talent to promote the improvement of economy and social wealth. By allowing an extension for STEM OPT, the United States can attract more talented international students here to contribute their high skills, thus leading to the economic prosperity. On the contrary, with a short time of training opportunities, companies may lose these talent people after one year. And as we all know, high competent individuals is one of the important components of the success for a company. 

Thus, I highly support for the regulation of expanding the STEM OPT.
