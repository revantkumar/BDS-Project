I support this rule.

I think American should give everyone the same chance no matter where we come from, that's the American spirit.

I work for an engineering company in Flushing New York. Some people from China need engineer to help them finish their new house or new store. But most of them cannot speak English fluently. So they want engineer who can speak Chinese to work for them. And if it is a big project, 1 year is not enough to finish the job. 

And longer OPT will attract more international students come and study in American. It is good for US economy. I spend a lot of money when I was a student in school.
