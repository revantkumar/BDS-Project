Yi Hua There is a shortage of qualified STEM worker not only in the research but also in the high tech industry. According to data from the National Center for Education Statistics, over 50 percent of the doctoral degrees in engineering, math and computer sciences are earned by international students. Without the STEM OPT extension, there is going to be a huge decrease in the supply of work force in the high tech industry. A lot of the job would have to be outsourced to other countries. Therefore, instead of harming US economy or the chance for US citizen to get jobs, the extension would only bring more jobs and opportunities for the country. 

In addition, US owns its competitiveness in the world due to the talents and technology the country owns. Foreign students with STEM degrees have been an important source of supply for the talents. Without the STEM extension, US would be sending its own trained brilliant minds to the competitors.

Therefore, I support expanding the OPT period for F1 students with STEM degree.
