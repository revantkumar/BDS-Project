I strongly SUPPORT this OPT extension policy. If you think this rule sabotages the employment of Americans, please take a look at the jobs these STEM international students have and also the unemployment cases. There's no direct causality inbetween. Numerous highly skilled immigrants contributed to the US in the past decades. Now attracting and retaining international students in math, science, engineering and technology is important to keep the nation competitive and strong. I highly support the new OPT extension rule.
