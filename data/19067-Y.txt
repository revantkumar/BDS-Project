As an international student in the United States, I pursued a STEM degree and graduated in 2014 with a masters degree in the field of IT & Management. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes. However, I was happy to see the new proposed rule for STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, as well as an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.

The proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. Foreign talent from all over the world contribute to the growth of US Economy by getting involved in research and innovation in fields such as Energy, Medicine, Technology, etc. Providing these students and workers with the experiential training along with the latest technology and resources available in the US will bolster their contributions to the US economy.

Moreover, travel, educational and living expenses as well as the income tax paid by foreign workers contributes a large amount to the US economy. 

Many opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Foreign-born students who graduate with advanced degrees from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.
