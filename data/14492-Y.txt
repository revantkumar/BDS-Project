The Opt 24-month extension rule for STEM degrees is definitely a good policy for both STEM students and employers in US.

As a former student studying mechanical engineering, I know that the time that a fresh graduate mechanical engineer needs to fully develop his skills is rather long, definitely more than a year. The new extension rule will 1. give STEM students more time to develop their skills and 2. allow employer to put them in positions that needs more skills and experience, and such positions in industry need much more employee then the US citizens can provide.

The new extension rule will partially fill the need of highly educated and experienced engineers in industry, and therefore will definitely benefits US employers in the long term.
