I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international Electrical Engineering master student and is an intern. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my master degree in US, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and British. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. It is like treating to those who are attracted by the OPT extension policy. For me, I would not come to US if there is no OPT extension. If terminated, it is treating to me. If so, I cannot believe US government any more. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. BTW, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. 

Besides, I think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program. Based on my previous work experience, most large research/software development projects would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion.
