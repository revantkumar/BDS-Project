I support the extension of OPT for STEM students. The United States has been a great nation attracting international talents. It is the open-mindedness that attracted me and many young minds to come and study in the US. Countless of international students have contributed to the leading technology/scientific discoveries of the US. America will lose a great amount of young talents if the OPT extension is removed. Many of the smartest foreign students find I know are currently working under OPT. Their employer appreciate them enough to offer H1B visa to them, however the visa won't be approved until October 2016. If the extension of OPT is removed, these talented people will have to leave the country and abandon their rising career. US will suffer from a great loss of many young talents.
