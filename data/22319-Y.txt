To who it may concern,

The policy of opt extension is very important. What makes a better world, competition and innovation. The opt extension not only provide a opportunity for foreign elites to have a chance to accomplish the individual career and benefits the industry of U.S, but also bring more competition to American society. Laziness will destroy a country. A more robust society always need more fresh blood. I believe the opt extension will definitely benefit U.S.
