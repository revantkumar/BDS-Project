My comment is very simple: I'm damn sick and tired of foreigners getting preferential treatment in all phases where they are subsidized: free housing, free food, free hospitalization etc. Just ask a vet how much great treatment he or she gets when coming home from serving. This administration is so anti - military it's disgraceful! This administration is so anti- everything America stands for - someone once said President Obama doesn't love America; truer words were never spoken. That statement sure set goldilocks (Wasserman Shultz) in a dither. She didn't even need a perm to curl her hair. I pray we will have a true patriot in office next election - one who can straighten out the mess Obama has created, one who does love America and will work for the American people not for the power of self.
