Chetan Kanthala International students mainly come to USA because of their diversified and practical applications of the subjects which they learn during masters. Keeping this in view ahead and spend lots of money for their education (by survey it is know that many international student support their education by taking various kind of loans, because of inadequate family financial conditions)

Not only in spending huge amount for our education we will be dreaming of gaining very good knowledge in our respective fields which is only only possible by practical application (i.e OPT,CPT,Internships). Due to reducing the the OPT period for STEM students which is worse in spending lot of amount,time and dedication on studies.

So Please try to understand our (F-1) hard work which we are putting towards our education these 2 years and please give us chance to fulfill our dreams and make our countries and make USA proud in giving us this opportunity.

kindly,
one of the future dreamer.
