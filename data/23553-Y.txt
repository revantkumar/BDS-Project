I strongly agree OPT extension for the following reason.

1. People working in OPT are NOT cheap label, they are highly professional who pay tax and contribute themselves to US economy. They bring in strong support to several fields, as most impact in Computer Science, which is a huge economy source for US. 

2. People working as STEM OPT will not squeeze the labor of US citizens. Instead they will filled out the labor gap for several area in US economy, which helps US to develop and expand their power.

3. Students graduated from US (undergrads or graduate school) should have the chance to contribute what they had learned in here. They knowledge and power they will contribute to US is DEFINITELY beneficial for US. 

4. OPT students pay tax as well, so they can also contribute to US society and US economy, there will be no benefit if they were forced to move out of US with their knowledge and power of contribution.
