I, as a proud American IT worker/developer, am strongly opposed to the proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program. This rule would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates like my son and daughter.

In an economy with such under and unemployed Americans as we face today, measures such as this rule can not and should not be made to the detriment of our own people. If you believe in true capitalism and the law of supply vs demand, more Americans will eventually benefit in what is increasingly the future employment area of growth in our economy.
