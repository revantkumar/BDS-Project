I strongly SUPPORt the new proposed rule for improving and expanding training opportunities for F1 non immigrant students. This will not only help students but it will also help organization/companies to have international brains at workplace. ckmpanies are getting qualified employees right here and don't have to go out of america. 
And for the citizen of america, I don't think they should even worry about this law because in some or the other way they are all given preference. Also, america is an "equality " based country, and job opportunities shouldn't be affect by someone's visa status unless and until it is legal.
