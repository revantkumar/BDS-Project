Providing incentives for companies to hire more foreign workers is a bad deal for all workers. I work in Silicon Valley and I can tell you the majority of the workers are from foreign countries - here on visas or now holding green cards. Those with a visa are like inedentured servants - they don't speak up for fear of losing their job and being sent home. They are paid wages lower than US folks - and the reason is "we're restricted to what we can pay you by the regulations of your visa..." - it's ridiculous. I have a co-worker who was offered a job (she's from a foreign country) - when she got here the terms of things changed because they had to bring her in on a different kind of visa - she's making 1/3 of what she should be making as well as not getting any benefits whatsoever. 1/3! In Silicon Valley you can't survive on that but what can she do, she moved thousands of miles and then the company changed the rules on her. Her only choice is to stay and put up with it, or go back home. 

Companies already skirt the law - they'll post a position knowing full well they already have a candidate sitting in a foreign company they're going to hire. They will do a few phone screens, maybe an in person interview or two, but with no intention of hiring anyone but that person they've already identified in that foreign country. It's too easy today for companies to not hire US citizens - don't make it even easier.
