This is an obscene overreach of government.
The USA is a Democracy.
It is ruled by its people.
The figureheads that we send to Washington are to
carry out the will of the people.
Just because the President has a Brain Fart does not make it the Law of the Land.
We have never suggested that the mind of any President held more wisdom than the combined intellect of
our 100 Senators who were duly elected to create the Laws and Actions of our Nation.
