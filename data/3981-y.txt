I strongly support the new Stem extension policy.

1 Although some people hold the view that internaitional student are taking jobs from american peers in stem career. I think This is far from the truth. As a matter of fact, engineers are in high demand right now. For example, Chevron has numerous positions open for stem student.Just like what keith wolf said:"We're seeing strong demand for mechanical engineers, particularly within the manufacturing and oil and gas industries. We're seeing a wide range of design, technical sales, project management and manufacturing manager roles that are seeking skilled mechanical engineers." 

2) secondly, international student highly skilled expands American work-force and encourage more business start-ups. In many cases immigrants' educational backgrounds complement, rather than displace, the skills of the native-born labor market.
