It makes me very angry when people say oh OPT is allowing foreigners steal our jobs! First of all, everything else being equal, if an American and a foreigner apply for the same job, the company will have no doubt hiring the America. Why? He/she speaks english natively; the company gets more tax benefits by hiring locals. Then why would companies still want to hire foreigners? Because they cannot find many specific skill sets in Americans! They would even rather go through all these trouble to hire a foreigner because he/she can do the job! So for those Americans, stop blaming your failing life on foreigners. They simply work hard and want to contribute. And should I remind you many of us, at some point, came from somewhere foreign. What happened to the founding principle of this country?
