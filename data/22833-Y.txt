As an international student major in Electrical and Computer Engineering, I strongly SUPPORT the proposal!

The very basic reason of my opinion is that the government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S..

As we can see in the US society today, international students are making huge contributions to our country. Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010, according to the Partnership For A New American Economy (http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf). 

Admitted, international students participation in the job market itself would increase competition in the short term. You may find it harder to get into Google or Facebook because there are more talented people in the pool. However, if we reject them simply because of this, we should not educate our children at all every college graduate enters the job market to increase competition. In the long term, competition increases efficiency, accelerates development and benefits us all. Do not let irrational fear of competition ruin our true interest.

To sum up, I strongly believe we should pass this proposal and pass more bills in the congress that could make it easier for the international students to stay.
