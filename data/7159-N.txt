As a natural born American citizen in the Computer Science profession, I am vehemently opposed to this proposal to increase opportunities for F-1 student visa holders.

Since 2000, U.S. companies have overwhelmed this country with an influx of foreign workers through legal abuse of the F-1, H-1B, and L-1 visa systems. These policies were originally intended to attract the "best and the brightest" workers to the U.S. and augment our native workforce. Instead, they are being legally abused to import vast quantities of average workers who become de-facto indentured servants while they await green card approval.

While the industry often claims that there is a shortage of STEM workers, it has been repeatedly documented that they are in fact looking for cheap workers* and intentionally avoid hiring qualified Americans. This cost savings is achieved by legally underpaying them and by hiring young, inexperienced people who displace older, more experienced workers. 

Our American STEM policy is deeply flawed as it encourages legal discrimination against American workers either through direct replacement or by hiring foreigners instead of Americans. Two companies involved in high profile tech worker replacement incidents in 2015 include Southern California Edison** and Disney***.

This policy will further erode the native American STEM workforce. In addition, it discourages our children from pursuing STEM careers as the career potential under such adverse conditions is highly unattractive. I strongly urge you to reject this proposal.
