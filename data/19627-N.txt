I oppose the DHS expansion of the OPT. I don't think it's prudent to allow foreign students to stay in the US and compete for jobs with US citizens since there seems to be a slight edge for the foreign student regarding employers not paying taxes and social security taxes on these employees. This is attractive to employers because they can pay less for that foreign employee. It is reprehensible that US employers are essentially traitors to the US citizen student. How much profit is enough?
