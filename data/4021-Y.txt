I think extending opt for international students is definitely a win-win solution. To the US, we get cheaper and better quality labor force, and it also will attract more students to come to study at America which will bring us a huge profit. To the international students, they get to gain the experience of working in US, so they might influence their friends come to US for college or bring their kids to the US as well. Talented people will be able to find job without worrying about the H1B working permit.
