I cannot believe the U.S. govt is missing a chance to collect taxes! the administration wants to give employers even more money by not paying medicare and social security taxes? I have voted Dem most of my life but this is really the last straw. I just cant take it any more. dont know who i will vote for but it wont be dem. someone should feel really ashamed for even thinking this is a good idea.
