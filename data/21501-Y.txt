I strongly support the new STEM OPT rule for the following reasons

Firstly, the OPT program will attracts more international students to come to study in the US, which will promote American economy significantly . From the open door data of the Institute of international education, in California, "International students and their families created or supported 340,000 jobs and contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy during the 2013-2014 academic year, according to NAFSAs latest economic analysis.". Also, this promotes relationship between the U.S. and other countries. 

Secondly, It helps the growth of the companies in many different ways. Most of the international students have accepted advanced education and a large number of them have Phd degrees. Companies can benefit a lot from hiring those talented employees. Also, it promotes the culture diversity of a company. 

Some people think that the OPT rule have negative impacts on hire opportunities to the native works. However, I do not agree with this opinion as the fact that there is always an IT tech people shortage in the U.S. especially in silicon valley. A lot of companies are in a hire surge. Also, from what I've seen from career fair and interviews, there are quite a few local companies that only hire native employees. 

In conclusion, OPT program is beneficial not only to the U.S. but also international students.
