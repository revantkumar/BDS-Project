There is no doubt that the United States needs 24 month's or more opt extension.
1: Try to look at how many international employees worked in Silicon Valley's high-tech company, how many CEO have international background. Why the United States has most great high-tech companies? Then you can see how much contribution international students made for this country. If the opt extension rule get canceled, a huge number of these intelligent people will be forced home, a lot of companies will lose a lot of or most of their employees, so company may even shut down, if a lot of company shut down, how many local American people will lose their job? How much tax IRS will lose? Actually that is not the worst things, if there are no opt extension rules, most engineering students will not come to study in the US any more, which means High-Tech companies will lose their employee resource in the future, try to think how terrible it is for the United States! The United Stares needs to look futher!
