Hello, I am a graduate student from China. I am studying biochemistry for a PhD. 

To be honest I would like to stay in US to work when I graduate. After all who would not? Therefore I SUPPORT the extension of OPT.

When we look at American history, we can easily see that a major reason US has been staying on the top is because she attracts all the talents all over the world. I wouldn't imagine if US will become a close-minded country, being afraid of talented people to come and stay. It would not be healthy for America, economically and mentally. Do you really want to kick out all the highly educated young people out of American border after you have spent so much money training them? Don't you want more LEGAL immigrants to be in America instead of ILLEGAL ones? The extension of OPT is not only giving us foreign student a chance to stay, but also giving America a chance to survive the coming international competition. How about all those PhDs coming to their home countries, with top notch American knowledge and starting to rival against their American peers Maybe it is for the best that keep them here, right?

Approve the OPT extension or reject? I think any sensible American would know what to choose.
