The so-called supporting data from your comment:

OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.

It is only from CIS blog and never approved by any government departments. Even though they declared that they got true data from DHS, before they publish the raw data, no one can believe that. Since this organization is always against anything new about the immigration, everyone should have the common sense to doubt whether they change any data or not, to fit their conclusion.

Even though, all the data are accurate, they totally ignore the truth that the international students also pay tax, living fee, tuition fee and etc, which is a great income for the US and a lot of citizens make money from leasing their house or apartments to oversea students. 

In a nutshell, I totally support the new rule and it will be beneficial to both US citizens and oversea students.
