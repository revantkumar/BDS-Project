OPT is a severe misuse of taxpayer dollars and a betrayal of the taxpayers and U.S. workers. U.S. workers on money is being used to deprive them of jobs they need to support themselves and their families. This hurts the U.S. economy. This program and this practice needs to stop immediately. It should never have been put in place. Perhaps we should hire foreign politicians to replace the ones currently in Congress, not all of them but the ones who support OPT.
