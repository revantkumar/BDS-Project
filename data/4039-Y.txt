Siyu Cong I am an Electrical Engineer working in San Diego. I totally support STEM OPT Extension. Engineers like me from foreign countries really appreciate the high tech environment here and we have made a lot of contributions to the technology industry using our hard work. But we really need longer time to work in America so that we can make more contributions. 

Usually an engineer needs one year to get proper training and afterwards, he or she can work independently and does a great work. But right now, since it is not guaranted to get H1B visa in one year and if there is no OPT extension, tons of engineers will leave America after their first year training. It is a huge loss to the companies hiring them who spend a lot of money, time and human resources to train those young engineers. It is also not fair for those engineers who spend a lot of time to get their education in America and hope to make contributions to the country.

So all in all, I think approving OPT Extension is a win-win to everyone.
