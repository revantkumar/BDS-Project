I support the improving and expanding of OPT STEM Program. International students undoubtedly add significant economic value to the US Economy. Apart from the large sums of tuition international students pay, they create jobs, develop new companies, contribute to innovative research. They pay taxes without every getting to benefit from the social security sustem, stay in the US legally and are some the of the smartest individuals in the world. Encouraging them to stay longer in the US will only help the US Economy grow.
Our neighbor, Canada, has long realized the value of International Students and continuously develops and implements policies in favor of encouraging more international students to study, work and immigrate to Canada. They currently allow international students to work up to 3 years in Canada after studies without any restrictions. This has not affected their unemployment rates and has only helped sustain the economy. 
On the other hand, UK has made it much harder for international students to work after graduating. This has led to significant loss in international student tuition revenue as students are discouraged from attending UK schools. However, its not like preventing international students has helped their economy. They suffer from low innovation, low growth and high rates of unemployment. 
US can learn from these countries. International students add so much value to the US Economy and hence, expanding the program makes complete sense!
