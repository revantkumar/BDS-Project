I strongly disagree with your opinion: both unfair comparison and disguised displacement.

First, international students invest a huge amount of time and money to get degrees in America. It contribute a large portion of institutional income and they pay tax, as Americans.

Second, companies, they don't hire students just for their lower wages, but for their excellence of helping the company grow and providing outstanding products and services. If the company stays competitive internationally, there won't be unemployment for US works. Adversely, it boosts US economy and creates more local job openings.

Last but not the least, strength of US in STEM is based on multi-culture. If you simply argue the unfairness for Americans because of your personal fear for competition, then the society won't grow. The development of US society is all about stepping forward with competition.
