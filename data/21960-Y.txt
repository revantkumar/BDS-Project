That anyone with a brain should prefer that we hire people outside of the United States in preference to our own American born citizens truly blows my mind. The parents of these college students invested a fortune for college tuitions hoping that their children would have a step up to a good life. not to mention giving back to the United States. They sacrificed plenty to afford to send them to college and many of our people are intelligent, honest, hard-working decent individuals who bring honor to our country. 
To prefer foreign students and give them all these benefits that are not accorded to our own people is WRONG! How in the world can this be allowed?
It is one way to destroy this once wonderful country. Could it be that that is the purpose?
I would like to see this practice completely overturned. I just don't understand preferring foreign help to our own citizens. Hopefully, someone will emerge who loves this country enough to start proceedings that will end this horrific situation!
