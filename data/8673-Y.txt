Zhuoming Li I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Knowledgable students can then make good contributions to the U.S. In the history, a great number of famous scientists, engineers and architects were once international students in the U.S, and have made left large contributions in the U.S during their stay after graduation.

2. The true cause of high demand for international students from companies is the high quality of international students. Companies who hire international students offer equal salaries to international students compared with natives. Some typical examples are Google, Facebook and Delta, etc.
