I strongly SUPPORT this proposal for these reasons:

1. I work in a Tech company and a lot of foreign employees or fresh gradates are as talented as American. They usually are the very top talents from India, China or other countries. If they go back to their countries and take what they learn in U.S back to those Chinese or Asian companies, those companies will be more competitive to U.S companies. In mobile phone industry, those Chinese companies like Huawei, ZTE or Xiaomi are already becoming threats to Apple or Moto in some European or Latin American market. If American companies are not doing well globally, it will definitely affect U.S economy.

2. Some American people think those foreign employees or students get the jobs that originally belongs to them. But I think the more foreign talents study and work in U.S, the more healthy competition it will create to inspire American people to study harder or work harder.
