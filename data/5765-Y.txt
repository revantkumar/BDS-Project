Carl Files This is why us people on social security are having a hard time affording the things we need. The government just keeps taking from us. We are not going to get a cost of living raise this year. All because GAS PRICES ARE DOWN. The price of food is still up. Thanks to Obamacare our insurance prices are too high. It is getting harder to afford our bills for our own homes and all we need to do to keep them. This is a very bad and STUPID idea. Thank you for thinking of us older people.
