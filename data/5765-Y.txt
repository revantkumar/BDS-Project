I really consider it is NECESSARY to expand the OPT for F-1 STEM International students, as it is the essential way for United States to attract elites from all around the world and continue leading the world.

If this country is effected by the ultraconservatives, who are just afraid of competing and elites and surmising it is the excellent International students fault that robbing their job opportunities, would be totally disappointing! Without flexible immigrant policy to attract excellent students taught and learned in USA, it would be hardly enough to enhance the high development of cutting-edge technology in this country. 

So, please, don't listen to the opponents who are trying to refuse those excellent and promising International students away from United States. Students need time, need opportunities to better develop their potential to serve this country.
