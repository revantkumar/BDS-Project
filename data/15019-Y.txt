US technology companies would shut down if proper OPT duration is not provided to international students, who spend a fortune to come here to study, gain knowledge and then contribute to the US economy by being one of the best brains. US has been a country of immigrants, and its the best brains of the world that come together here and make it the most powerful country in the world. If US becomes just another intolerant country like the Middle East, forget being on top of the world.

My point is, students who come here to study actually contribute more than what they take away, and extending the OPT helps both the students and the country. Its a win-win thing.
