In the next a couple of decades, the US work place will face shortage of highly skilled and highly educated workers, especially with baby boomers' are getting retired. We will need to try to keep those foreigner students primarily in Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics majors, who get their high education here in the States to remain in this country to be our new fresh blood, instead of letting them to receive the knowledge and training here but to develop another country somewhere else. 

A country's development and growth depend on highly educated and highly skilled work force other than refugees or un-documented immigrants with no skills and no knowledge. 

We should be more focused on trying to have better rules and to loosen our quota to keep those people who are highly educated and highly skilled and who are willing to work hard to make a life change in this country, other than opening our door easily to allow people who came to this country illegally with no skills and no knowledge and who want to stay and get supported by our government's welfare programs. We should and we need to have much more friendly laws for students with higher education and highly skilled workers than those for un-documented.
