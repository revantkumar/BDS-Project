I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. Competition is necessary for a field to development. I understand that local citizens want to have a stable working environment, but this will make them stop learning due to a less competitive environment; so that this trend brings a slow development for a field. Also, competition helps increase average skills for both local and international students.
