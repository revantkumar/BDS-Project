I believe this expanding is necessary for all of us. For students, it is an opportunity to express their ability to company. If we don't have this expanding, many excellent people will go back to their country. So we will lost lots of excellent workers and researchers. For company, it still need lots of students to go to work. It can promote the development of economic. Both sides need this opportunity. It is just give everyone the same chance. I think all the people who can work in USA is the top excellent person in all the countries.
