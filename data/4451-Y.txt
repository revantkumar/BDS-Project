I strongly AGREE this policy that STEM students have 12+24 months to working at here, and I will list some reasons to explain why I agree this policy.

1. America is an educational country and it absorbs amount of international students year by year, these students come from all over the world. All of these students get the most advanced knowledge at here and make contributions in many fields. I think the STEM students are highly needed, because USA is a developed country, lots of high-technology industry were produced at here such as GOOGLE, APPLE, and Microsoft. All these companies need lots of STEM students, so I think the 12+24 months can provide more chances for these talent students to get the H1B and contribute themselves to the technology. If the OPT extension is canceled, it will effect the technology in America very deeply!

2. Many international students apply schools at here because the America can provide the OPT extension, that is the most important difference than any other countries. If it was canceled, I think the income for education institution in USA will decreased a lot.......

3. I don`t think the OPT students effect the local people to find a job. I think for a company, the only hiring standard is a person`s ability, no matter what identify he is.
