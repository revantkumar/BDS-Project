Hong Yang I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

Students who have opportunity of studying at US are excellent talents and the development of technologies and the advancement of indutries need the most support from excellent employees. The extension will provide great resouces for a lot of big companies and startups. 

If the extension was stopped, there would be a large number of companies that could not keep normal pace of development, which would even result in a lot of companies facing the risk of being closed. It would further decrease the working opportunites of US to a great extent. Actually students who are pursuing programs at US help to create more working opportunities and provide great personnel to support the development of society.
