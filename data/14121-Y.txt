I strongly support the rule. Improving and expanding OPT would be a very helpful step in keeping those international students from U.S. institutions of higher education so that they could continue making contribution to this Country. It would be such a big loss for this country if these well-trained, higher-educated international students go back to their own countries with all the knowledge and skills learned here.
