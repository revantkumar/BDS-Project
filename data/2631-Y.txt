I strongly support the new OPT extension. I think as an international GIS student, when we decided where to purse the master or PHD degree oversea, the better training opportunity during school and after school is one of the most important factors. With the extension of OPT, it would attract more foreign STEM talent students to choose to study in US. As my own experience, if the OPT only lasts for 1 year, I may consider coming to Europe or Australia for my master study instead of US. Also if OPT extension is terminated by some reason, I think US high-tech companies, like Google and ESRI would encounter a huge disaster, since they are supported by so many STEM talents.
Another thing would be as a STEM student at Clark University, I noticed that some projects lasts for at least 2 years. If the OPT extension is terminated, some companies would not considered hiring international students, because the employee may lose their VISA before the project completion.
Since I was born in China, my family and friends are all back in China, I would eventually come back to China. But I think after 3 years working experience in US, I would be more competitive when I come back to China. 
Thus I think the new OPT rule would benefit not only students but also the US high-tech industry as well as the US education organizations.
