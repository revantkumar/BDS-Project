It's a reasonable and excellent decision. 
Many comments say that this bill will take away many native Americans' jobs. BUT
1) You can imagine how many Americans are truly willing to work in these fields? How many Americans are learning computer science or electrical engineering? Just A SMALL PERCENTAGE!!! The proportion is very low compared to other fields. So this bill will not affect most of the Americans. 
2) What's more, people working in Silicon Valley or engineering fields depend on their own talents. A better talent deserves taking a place in IT field and can create infinite value. They are creating wealth to U.S. economy, paying taxes according to law. They are rewarding the US society and can improve living standard of U.S. citizens as a whole. 
3) The job marketing is essentially not favorable to International students. Countless small companies only hire us citizens. Although some big companies are willing to hire foreigners, the number is still very small compared to those small companies. And it's not impossible for a competitive american not finding a job!
