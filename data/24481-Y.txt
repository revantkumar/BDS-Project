It is quite ridiculous for some negative comments saying that international students will harm the US citizens' employment.
Employers never employ students because they are international students!
Actually, it is a common sense that every employer wants to get the BEST students to meet their company's demand!
The BEST students can be US students as well as international students. The negative comments are assuming US students are inferior to international students which is absolutely TOTALLY WRONG!
