Zhuolin He I really hope that the new STEM rule will be approved. My reasoning is not just from personal experience, but also, in the consideration of what would this rule benefit United States in long run.

As a graduate biostatistics student, it's NOT at all easy to find a job in United States for a fresh graduated foreign student, I am confident about saying this because I've been through all these. If you go to a job fair held in university, some companies would tell you directly that they are not hiring F-1 students. Phone interviews for F-1 students most commonly begins with 'Do you need sponsorship to work in US?' for most companies are not willing to put in money and effort to help F-1 students to obtain H1B, and would rather hire somebody that are more stable and more easily blend in. In addition, as the H1B policy has becoming striker and striker over the years, most F-1 students are just working through the OPT period and leave US, so its not convincing to accuse that foreign students are stealing jobs from US citizens.

With this inevitable obstacle we are having finding a job in US, only the best of the best foreign students would be able to find a job, and the luckiest ones among them are able to stay in US. It's reasonable for those those good students to learn from the industry in US, and by learning, they are actually making money for US companies.

We all know that the most beneficial part for this rule approved is not F-1 students, for only those are able to find a job can actually using OPT, but the US companies would benefit a lot if this rule approved. For huge international company, they need more divers culture in the company so as to open the market across different countries and again, they are able to hold on to the best foreign students for a longer time period. At last, such rule will raise the image of United States, for foreign students will feel less unwelcome by the country than we already feeling.
