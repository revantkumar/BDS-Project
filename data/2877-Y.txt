I want to refute those arguments of anti immigration people:

1) Foreign students take away jobs:
Foreign students work very hard in IT industry to boost the economy of United States and bring prosperity in Silicon Valley
and Wall Street. To people who claim these have nothing to do with them, think about Ipad and Iphone and other Internet 
technologies(Ironically they probably use these technologies to express their opposition to foreign students!)

Foreign students also contribute a lot to US universities by paying tuition revenues which translate into scholarships
to US students. If OPT extension rule does not pass, the US education systme will be in total collapse.

2)Foreign students are cheap labor:
Talented foreign students earn very high salaries after they pass strict screening and earn the job by merit. There are indeed
many cases of abuse. We are in full support for very high and clear prevailing salaries as the provision in the new OPT rule.

3)If foreign students are talented, why they need training and the training creates tax loopholes for companies?

OPT is more than than training. It is an employment authorization in which students can apply what they have learned in school
to make contributions to US and earn salaries to pay back tuitition.
We also support closing tax loopholes as part of OPT program.

4)To those people who just shout based on negative emotions with inflammatoru rhetoric:
If they are really angry about not finding a job, why do not they spend some time studying and improving themselves?
If they really think US government should give them higher priority, do they actually contribute themselves to their country?
If American let insane nationalism, racism and xenophobia to define itself, American will never be the "shining city on the hill", or
the "world leader" or the "greatest country on earth" and will never have exceptionalism as many US politicians claim
