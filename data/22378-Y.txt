I definitely agree with the new rule OPT extension rule.

Firstly, as a Computer Science master from Asia, I think working in America is an excellent chance for me to enhance my background. This experience will help me to find a better job in Japan, China or Korea. These countries are so close to my hometown that I would like to work for long time in such places. What I need is just the employment record in America for some years. 

Secondly, the minority of US citizens just say How dare you expand Visas to foreigners when Americans cannot find jobs or Too many Americans are out of work and cannot find job. They never think of reasons of such situation. As we all know, its harder for an international student to find a job than US citizens in America society because many companies just want a mediocre US citizens but not an excellent foreigners. Those citizens who cannot find job just are because they are too lazy, too picky and too arrogant. Most international students are working in big companies with high salary and severe stress. They dont compete with most US citizens. US citizens just want to do light work, too. This is those international students who help US to keep its prosperity.
