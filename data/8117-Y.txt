Huan Zhang I strongly support the new OPT extension rule.

I am studying master of Actuarial Science at the University of Iowa. In our major, more than 90% international students don't have any financial support from the university. We pay tuition $27,890 per year which is 3 times more than in-state tuition. Let alone to say that almost all American graduate students have financial support and don't pay tuition. Tuition by international students contribute a significant amount of money to the university. 

I am from China. I am the only child of my family and Chinese economy is booming. Hence, I would return to China eventually. Before then, if I could have about 3 years work experience in US, I would be more competitive in Chinese job market. 

So, international students like me contribute a significant amount of money into US economy, i.e. tuition and living expenses. Without the OPT extension, a lot of students will not choose to pursue master degree in US considering the high expense.

Hope more people support this good rule.
