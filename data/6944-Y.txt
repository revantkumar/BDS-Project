I agree with the program. Many protesters point out that international students are competing for jobs with native Americans, which causes American people hard to find a job. It is just WRONG! Please stop the non-sense and open your eyes. If you can ever spend 2 minutes on Department of Labor's website and check the unemployment rate, you will see that Oct.2015 we reach the lowest unemployment rate - 5%, ever since the year of 2007, which was before financial crisis. Check out the link - http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000.
"It is getting harder and harder for American people to find jobs." Are you joking me?

Then, let's do a simple calculation here. 
http://www.census.gov/popclock/ shows that currently there are 322133700 people and thus unemployed people are 0.32 billion * 0.05 = 16.6 millions. OPT is used for international students who can work in the US legally after graduation, which means the students under OPT will mostly have entry-level positions in companies. Let's give a broad range - they are competing jobs with 20-30 year old native speakers which take 7% of the whole population, around 16.6 * 0.07 = 1.16 million. According to Census Bureau, in 2014, only 32% of Americans get a Bachelor's Degree. And let's say STEM majors only take 30% of them. Then 1.16 million * 0.32 * 0.3 = 111 thousand.

Please pay attention. 111 thousand people is less than 0.03% of the whole population. Pay attention! 0.03% Americans are in STEM majors and couldn't find an entry level job. From protesters' words, it sounds like OPT extension is the doom of America. You can pull out your calculator and tell they are absolutely lying.

But have you ever known the benefit of the OPT extension? 
1. No company would just want to hire an employee for one year. One year is even not enough to train him. Hiring a skillful employee will greatly benefit the company. International labors are not cheaper under OPT because companies have to pay for H1B application and a bunch of immigra
