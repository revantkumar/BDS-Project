I definitely give a support to STEM OPT extension.

Firstly, when they do professional training here using OPT, they also need to pay all taxes required, which is not correct in some comments. And it is just the opposite, they are making countributions to this country in various area.

Secondly, they can use what they learned in US to help developing countries. I am a student in agriculture major. My classmates from those developing countries are learning high techinologies to go back to help people who cannot get enough food in this world. As I am in a project to help African people which was initiated by US, I am thinking I am doing a meaningful and wonderful thing to help people only if I could have the opportunity to study in US, and training for real agricultural experience.

Thank you for all your considerations.

Sincerely,
Grace
