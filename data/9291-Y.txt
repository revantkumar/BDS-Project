I am totally against giving more training to foreign students. We should be setting up real training programs to American students to enable them to be trained in every field that will be useful in getting a good job with good wages. I know of any federal programs that at training Americans to get good jobs that pays a salary that will allow them to get what is needed in large numbers. What is offered now is for such a low number of people that in reality does not exist. I live near the Oak Ridge Nuclear Complex and the Oak Ridge National Labortory and they brag about training 10 or 12 people a year. Americans should come before any foreign student or non student.
