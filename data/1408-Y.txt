I Strongly support the opt extensionReasons are as follow

1, Most Ph.D. degree students are funded by U.S. government programs. We let them go to support other governments and countries to develop their techniques after we pay the tuition fees? 

2. If foreign students can find jobs in U.S. , that means they meet the requirement or have their advantage. No one will pay for useless persons. Why not let them stay?

3. The U.S. can stand on the top pf the world because of its inclusiveness, which is attractive to persons with ability. It is not wise to give it up.
