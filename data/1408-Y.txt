Jack Paul Great idea from DHS! Competition in the job market is the key that sustains US tech companies' competitive advantage in the world. If we don't keep these smart students in US, the foreign hi-tech companies like Samsung and Alibaba will become more and more powerful. Besides, a lot of foreign students take scholarship from our TAX. Why should we let them back to their country without any attributes to US?
