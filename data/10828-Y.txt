Students from different countries have, for decades taken benefits of the great universities in the United States, and have tried to apply the knowledge they have gained, in various fields. They have played a good part in the various technological innovations and discoveries over the past few decades and it is through the combined efforts of the American and the international students that have led to so many technological developments and advancements in various fields resulting into betterment and improving the quality of life of people in the United States and all around the world. It is therefore, in my humble opinion, logical to provide the international students the time they require with the OPT STEM extension, so that they can apply their knowledge and skills for more innovations and progress.
The STEM extensions should be reinstated so that all students have enough time to develop themselves and contribute to the technological progress of this nation.
