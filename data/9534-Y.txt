Marilyn Assenheim Gentlemen:

It has become an ever increasing belief that the government is forever trying to punish its own citizens. This proposal does nothing but add merit to that belief. 

I, and many like-minded citizens, do not understand just how stupid you think Americans are. If you believe that idiotic rules such as that proposed above are good for this country, you all deserve to go down with the ship you are very industriously ramming holes into. The rest of us, however, are not.

How is it possible that our own leadership wishes to offer incentives to prospespective employers to train and hire foreign nationals over a native citizenry? Almost 100 million people in this country are out of work. Yet we keep hearing that there is a 5.3 % unemployment rate. George Orwell could not have written more fantastic fiction. Sadly, however, this is not fiction. This is the reality that has been inflicted on our suffering nation. This goes beyond stupidity. This is twisted, deliberate intent. This is cruelty and savagery. And everyone is aware of it.

I cannot wait until the authors of such debauched agendas are drummed out of office. I can only hope that there is a nation left before that can occur.
