I feel it's a great opportunity for US to welcome young entrepreneurial energetic minds that is grassroots of the American culture and economy. US has an aging population invested in the domestic economy, which is retiring soon, and their interests are aligned with a growth in the American markets. I fully support making it seamless and easy for educated students from STEM to gain employment here in US.
