I strongly support the approval of extended OPT. It will benefit both American Universities and companies.

I am an engineer working in a start up company in California. I also have a lot of friends who are engineers from foreign countries working in America. So all the things I said below are based on my our real experience. It is nothing truth but only truth. Engineers need training before they can make real contributions. Without extended OPT, foreign engineers can only work for a year. Then the companies who hire them will waste their money and time to train those new engineers and then let them leave the country. Besides, foreign engineers have already made and will make big contributions to American economy development. They should have the right to stay here.

Many students come to study in America because only because they have a chance to work and stay in America afterwards. If there is no extended OPT, the chance to stay in America is very little, which will dramatically decreases the number of foreign students applying to American universities. It is bad for both the finance and academic of American universities.
