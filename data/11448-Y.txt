I, as an F-1 student, strongly support STEM extension policy. Getting a job depends on thew study field of a student. There are several areas, where it takes more than 12 months to get a job. This is not only true for an international student, but also for Americans. Moreover, many subjects does not have a good field in the native countries of that F-1 student, but only in US. Therefore, I am in full support in favor of OPT extension.
