Longhai Cui I strongly agree with the DHS new regulation to improve and expand the training opportunities for F-1 non-immigrant students with STEM Degrees.

Some people argue that the foreign student are coming to the United States and are taking away jobs from the Americans. But they are missing out some important facts. Science is the engine of prosperity. 50% percent of the Ph.D candidates are foreign born and this number is even higher in the high technology systems. These future scientists and engineers are actually making significant contribution to create the whole high-tech industries, which results in the continuous growth in the U.S. economy and more job opportunities for Americans. 

We need more scientists and engineers for the whole society improve and develop, not less of them. But there are not enough domestic graduate students, who can fill up the demanding need of the high technology industry. 1 year of training in the field is not sufficient for the foreign students to get experienced and give back to the industry, especially in the STEM areas, which need high intelligence and constant practice. Eliminating the STEM extension will definitely do non-negligible harm to the industries and collapse the economy, which as a final result, would cause more unemployment of the American people.
