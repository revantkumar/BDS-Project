A hero is a hero no matter where she or he is from. 
The benefits of the WHOLE COUNTRY should ALWAYS be placed over the complaints of a small group of people. 
If America still wants to stay strong and lead the whole world, she should ALWAYS keep hiring the TALENT everywhere in every industry. 
So regardless of the NATIONALITY, please give her or him a shot if she or he is the TALENT for the job. 
This is called FAIR and RATIONAL, as this is BENEFICIAL to the industries and thus the country. 

If, according to the feedback of the employers, the international students are indeed TALENTED, QUALIFIED and did CONTRIBUTE a lot to the industries, they should be given the shot as they deserve it and this country is fair. 
If so, I would even say that an extension of 24 months is far below enough to help the industry keep the TALENT and stay COMPETITIVE. 

Last but not least, there are too MANY factors attributing to the local unemployment. 
So it is NEVER convincible to attribute unemployment only to the small group of international students.
