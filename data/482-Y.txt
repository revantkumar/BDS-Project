We are against expanding and improving training opportunitites for F1 nonimmigrant students with STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for all Eligible students. We have read information that is factual stating that many american citizens with stem training and degrees are looking for work. We are also aware that the tech industry has lobbied and paid large amounts of money to the govt. to obtain more out of country workers while ignoring American citizens. Also we are aware that the Obama admin wants to go around the constitutional legislative process and ignore the congresses need to vote on any increase in bringing more workers to the US for low wages and putting American workers out of work.
