I strongly support the proposed extension of STEM OPT.

A lot of opposing people argue that international STEM students are taking away jobs from citizen STEM students. This is simply not true. I talked to a recruiter at Google not long ago and she said Google was always in need of more programmers but there are not enough qualified people to fill those positions. Rather than blaming non-citizen STEM students for taking away STEM job, Americans should blame their education system for not making American students competent or competitive enough to obtain those IT jobs.

What keeps American universities so popular for STEM students is the opportunity to train and work in the U.S for a longer period of time relative to non-STEM students. These students bring innovative and diverse ideas into the workplace and it is beneficial to American companies. If the STEM extension no longer exists, it is imaginable a lot of STEM talents will choose to go to other countries such as Britain and Australia which have more friendly work policies.
