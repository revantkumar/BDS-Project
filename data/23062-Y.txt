I support the improvement and expansion of STEM OPT.

Employees who are in STEM OPT extension have proven their value in their position and they have started their contribution to team as training period is completed. They are not longer new hires and company do expect their contribution during this period.

It would be great loss for most companies especially high tech companies if their employees have to leave because of visa issue. It is time consuming to get a best fit from the job market. 

In addition, I would suggest more regulation on technical consulting/ IT service firms. Contractor with lower wage is the main reason for most high tech company layoff.
