Bonnie Whitman I totally support the expansion of the OPT program.

If the US wants to improve its education level and attract more international students, it has to expand the training opportunities for F-1 students, especially those with STEM degrees and will make great distributions to certain crucial industries. Otherwise, attractions to international students will largely decreased compared to the UK and other countries. Besides, I don't think this will significantly squeeze out the US citizens from those industries So far, it is still very hard for international students to find a job even for students with STEM degrees. Most companies still consider US citizens for most of the time. Therefore, I strongly agree with the expansion of the OPT program.
