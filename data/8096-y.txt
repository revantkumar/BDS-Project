Mary MacDonald I'm sorry, but I am totally against this! No wonder we have so many college grads that can't find work and are forced to return to parents home.
They say they want STEM grads well, my son has a PHD in Mechanical Engineering and couldn't find a job in his field. What does THAT tell you?

I agree with Senator Grassley:
"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 yearsthe same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be validthere is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent."
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley
