I support this new OPT extension program for F1 non immigrant students. 

First of all, by providing longer time for F1 students to work in companies in America would enable them to gain sufficient working experiences also these experiences would enhance business tie with America when they go back to their home countries. 

We all aware that world is advanced due to the development of science and technology. Why people would think America as the most powerful country in the world? It is because America has the most number of High tech companies and these companies act as the pillars of American economy. When we talk about Facebook, Google, Apple or uber, we are fascinated by their imaginative but also functional products. The developments of these companies are supported by many F1 students after their graduation. By providing them longer time of OPT, they could serve the company well and hence the whole America economy. 

Also, we could not ignore that F1 students are the main group in working or even creating start-ups in America. During their OPT period, they may choose to join or create their own firms. That is the most straightforward ways to create job opportunities in American. 

Due to the above factors, I believe that, extending the OPT period for F1 students would be a win-win situation for both America and the students group.
