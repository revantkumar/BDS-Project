I strongly support the new 24-month rule. The success of U.S. in the past has shown the importance of contributions made by international students and immigrants. Those talented students trained in U.S. should have opportunities to make a pay back to U.S. society. Besides, the spirit of U.S. is the equal opportunity for everyone who has an American dream. The STEM OPT extension ensures this and it will help to attarct more and more talented international students to come to U.S., which will help to imporve the U.S. development in the end.
