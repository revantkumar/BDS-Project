There's great news if you're a recent college grad and you're looking for work. Washington has a program that provides a financial incentive for employers to hire you.

But only if you're a foreigner. U.S. citizens need not apply....

....Even though these are college graduates, DHS designates them as foreign students. Foreign students don't pay payroll taxes. And neither does the employer. The employer is exempt from paying the 6.2% Social Security and 1.45% Medicare taxes. That nearly 8 percent difference means an employer can save money by hiring a foreigner over an American.

This is NOT fair! This is not a level playing field! My kids are in college with unemployed friends who recently graduated. They also know many foriegn students which have ALL gotten jobs after graduation. This program is working well at getting employers to favor foreign students over American students!
