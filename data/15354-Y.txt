I work here in the U.S.A., PAY it's tax's, and support my fellow Americans. Employment is absolutely mandatory in order for everyone to move forward, because without a job people face too many challenges (such as homelessness). "We The People" do not need to compete with someone that can afford to work and not pay taxes, social security, or participate in the Affordable Care Act. Instead of improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 students I would like our elected representatives to expand training for Americans while providing them with educational loan/debt relief.
