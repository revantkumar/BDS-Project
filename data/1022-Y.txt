I am strongly in support of the STEM OPT extension.

Many other comments state that this extension will affect the employment of US citizens, because companies tend to hire cheap foreign labors. This is not true!

1. For any company, they are more focused on the capabilities of the job seekers, and more interested in how much benefits the job seeker can create for the company, not the paying taxes they can save.

2. The F-1 students are already at a disadvantage position when apply for jobs. The attached file is the snapshot of one random page from the program guide of the career day held in my school. In this year(2015), there were over 230 company attendees, but only 26 companies would accept workers with F-1 visa (or OPT). It is really hard for F-1 students to find a job in the U.S. since there are just a few available work positions. For many other work positions, F-1 students even do not have the chance to compete. By the way, our school is Colorado School of Mines, it's a typical STEM school.

3. For F-1 students, we really need the OPT extension so that we can at least get the chance to study through work. For many of us, we choose STEM so that we can get the knowledge to build a better world. However, what we learned in school are mostly just theories. We still need to learn how the theories are used in piratical. The best way to gain such kind of knowledge is working in companies. OPT extension can give us the ticket to start such learning journey.
