I viewed several comments that are objecting this extention. The main concern of them is that F-1 students might have the job oppotunities, which in their opinion, should be given to citizens of this country. But actually it's not true, they are working at those positions that cannot hire enough citizens. So it never comprosimes citizens' interest. So I strongly SUPPORT this regulation.

STEM students working in U.S. companies have proved their value for various industries in this country. If they are not allowed to keep making contribution here, they will have to leave. But please DON'T FORGET WHY America attracted so many people from the whole world. OPPORTUNITY, the origin of this country's prosperity.
