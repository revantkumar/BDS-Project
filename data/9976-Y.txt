I strongly support in extending OPT STEM extension to 24 months is a great step which will helps all the international students by giving time to explore technical aspects and obtain required skills with this extension.I believe that USA is a place to pursue masters degree and provide OPT which is to implement their theory course practically.This is a great advantage for students and companies in USA.It will be helpful in gaining more practical knowledge with this extension

It will great full and really looking forward for this rule to implement in action as soon as possible.
