I strongly support this proposal.

First of all, expanding training opportunities for nonimmigrant students is an action showing how open the United States is. The vast opportunities for everyone to accomplish their dreams have been rooted in this land. And this is why United States become today's United States.

Second, this proposal indeed help with the career of the nonimmigrant students, but it does not mean that it will hurt the interests of local people. Expanding OPT mainly help those students adjust to this society. It will not result in a significant decrease in the number of jobs available. Actually, if nonimmigrant students can have a longer time to match themselves to the most suitable jobs, they can make more contributions to the economy. The efficiency of the society as a whole will be greatly improved, too.

Finally, the fear for the competition is not the reason to block ourselves. If we want to improve the welfare for people here, the best way is certainly to create a larger pie by allowing competition, but not to keep the pie away from others. In economics, we all know that any action trying to protect a certain kind of people by running a risk of loss of competition is an action against the forward trend of the world.
