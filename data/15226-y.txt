Yi Li I support OPT extension, the biggest competent for US job market is the booming outsourcing industries. Most international students utilizing OPT are only temporary working in US and intend to go back to home countries after one or two years of experience. If OPT get cancelled, it will be even easier for outsourcing contractors to obtain visa and get hired. They provide a real threat to US job market since they have fix sets of skills targeting company needs, not paying equivalent taxes and thus ask for a very low salary. These people are also the ones seeking to stay in US permanently.
