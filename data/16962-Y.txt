Hello, 

Thanks for making the rule soon. I would like to say that "It's really really important for a student who did masters here in USA. Not every student comes here are financial good. We come here with dreams. Dreams of like in software and other respective fields. Already there is huge competition for H1-B visa with all other respective individuals including students.

When VISA's are issued for more than 100k each year, how you justify with 20k on OPT quota H1B visa. And I have serious issue we come here to do masters and then we try hard to get placed in companies. But its easy for the people who are coming from home countries directly with H1-B.

I feel students who did masters here with certain credit limit should be given higher priority than all others.

I feel 24 months OPT is good but its not worth. Either H1B quota for students (F-1 visa)should be raised else OPT session should be raised to 1year Opt+36 months (OPT-Extention) 4 Years in total.

And important note is no company is ready to take OPT students for jobs. Please do deal with this too.

Thanks.
