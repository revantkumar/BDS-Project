We do not do enough for our American born citizens attending school. Why would it be
right to give so much leeway to foeign born student want-to-bes in our precious USA.
Too much of this has already gone on in my life time. We send manufacturing job overseas so our American people are out of work. Now more is being done for the foreign students to study here and then work here. More jobs for our American born
younsters/experienced workers. We would not have as many immigrants in this country
had we allowed our own to work - for example, kids working in the strawberry fields
here in OR. One kid dieing in the frield and now all the kids are not allowed to
work those jobs. So we allow illegals to cross the border and take those jobs. Now
our government sats we gave to keep all these illegals. My children, all four, 
worked in the fields from the time they were 14 or younger. They wanted to do this.
This kepmt them busy and out of trouble. They bought their own cars from their savings, and put themselves through College. I am proud of my children and all those
other kids who did them same. Kids need to do worthwhile things, but legislation
prevents this. They would have no time to hang out 24/7 as they are mostly these
days. God Bless you all for doing the work you are doing. I pray every day for this
country to turn around and be truthful and fair to it's own.
