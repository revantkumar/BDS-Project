I strongly support the 24-month STEM OPT extension rule.
36-month OPT is necessary to train a well-qualified STEM worker and to benefit the US industry in return.
One year practical training is way too short for training a fresh college graduate to be a qualified engineer or scientist. Another 24 month extension is needed to provide a sufficient time window for STEM students to get after college education. The similar length of residency period is required for a medical school graduate to become a well-trained doctor. 
From the side of US industry, companies will not benefit from just spending one year to train the STEM graduates and send them back to their own countries. After training, the STEM graduates are expected to practice the skills they learn in the way of conducting projects. 24-month extension is an appropriate time window for STEM students gaining enough industry experience and produce corresponding profit for US companies.
