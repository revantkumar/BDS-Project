I strongly support this proposal. As someone who works with a lot internationals. I have to say, they are smart, extremely hardworking and do make a lot contributions to US. There is already enough limitations for international professionals to work and live in the states, it's not reasonable to add another one. I strong disagree that STEM students drag down the wage and lower the citizens' employee rate. If you are the manager, will you hire a high school, rude citizen rather than a well educated foreign student? We should keep those people who can make contribution to the society, not giving job to lazy citizens.
