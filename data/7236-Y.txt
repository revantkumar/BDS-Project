To begin with, I think the STEM extension can bring huge benefits to the technical companies in United States. Students who are eligible for STEM extension are all well educated university students and they have the professional knowledge which makes them competent in their work. Letting these students go back to their countries on the other hand is a waste of either the education resources or the companies' resource. Further more, I think having STEM extension is a catalyst that can attract more and more talented people to contribute to the humanity and technically prosperity of United States which will be a big plus for the whole society. As a result, I am in favor of the policy.
