I absolutely SUPPORT the proposal for the new 24 month-extension of STEM OPT. 

STEM fields are the boosting power of US economy, STEM OPT students who can get a job in US are recognized valuable to the US companies and thus to the US economy. Why should US let go such valuable human resources? An STEM OPT student received high-standard education in US colleges, they should work in US, contribute their skills and knowledge to US, instead of to other countries.
