Hengming Chen I am a graduate student with F-1 visa and as far as I am concerned, Colleges here helps me to learn technology and I can make my own contribution to the US using the knowledge that I learnt. I believe that millions of students like me are so important to help US to keep playing the leading role in the world! 
Second of all, competition does not exist and most of the jobs that fit for the F-1 students are those that not fit for the natives. Also, it is only a extension of OPT and many F-1 students will not apply for the extension of OPT since they decide to go back to their home country.
Canada, also as a country of immgration, has something for us to learn from. All Canada foreign students who graduate from college or university, will automatically have 3 years working permit. And I believe that is the way of Canada Government to keep improving STEM of Canada.
Thus, I hope we can have the extension and it is the mutual benefit. Thank you! God Bless America!
