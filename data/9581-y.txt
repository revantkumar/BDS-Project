Yuqi Wang I am strongly in support of the rule because of the following: 
1. From the very beginning, the USA is a country that is formed by immigrants. It is the social acceptability that made this country powerful and developed. If the states abandoned its acceptance of new immigrants, prosperity of the country would definitely slow down. 
2. In 21st century, core competence among the countries lies in talented people. OPT and extension enables high-talented STEM knowledgeable people to stay long in the states, which actually reinforce American's competence.
3. Considering the economy of the states, the GDP that is created by foreign labors, including people who work on their OPT and OPT extension, is never ignorable.
4. Currently, the funding in schools for research (especially PhD programs) is not enough. The enrollment of international student helps school to gain profit to support research. Without OPT or OPT extension, the motivation for international students to study overseas is reduced, which directly harms the research-ability.
