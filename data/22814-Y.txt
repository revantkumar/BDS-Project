The US began with the incoming of people from all over the world who devote all their hard work and talent to this free, no-bias land , and it is this never-stopped global mobility that allows a batch of talented STEM workers from outside of this nation to gather here and stoke the development of this super power.These STEM workers,including so many great minds like Einstein, come to US DO NOT intended to get from this nation BUT to give to. The US is a free land where they can freely relieve their passion for science and technology and most importantly it's a highly-advanced nation that values, needs and deserves their great achievement. I believe these STEM workers who have made a significant contribution to this nation he/she moved into just fulfill all the obligation of a citizen, even though they are not. So many non-immigrant STEM workers left for the US in early years and went back to their mother land at their 40s or older, just devoting the most vigorous and productive 10-20 years in their lives to this nation without asking for nothing from it. I fully support for the extension of OPT for potential non-immigrant STEM workers, which is inherit from the original open mind since the foundation of the US and will keep this nation benefited by this powerful global mobility of intelligence.
