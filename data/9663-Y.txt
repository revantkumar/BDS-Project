I strongly SUPPORT the opt-extension rule. Diversity is one of the most critical factors that make United States the most powerful in the world, and the extended opt can reinforce this diversity. Thousands of companies will benefit a lot from this new rule and so will the economy. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy. In summary, the opt extension rule is a very beneficial rule and it should be overwhelmingly supported!!
