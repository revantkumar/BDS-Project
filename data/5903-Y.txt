Steven Glass The H1B program has been expanded over the years from its original intent for the sole purpose of corporations being able to save money in the area of compensation and benefits. The only benefit to expanding this program is to the corporation's bottom line. The ill effects of expansion are to American workers that cannot find suitable work within their field of study, especially for those that are within the STEM definition. As a country, our first priority should be to the American workers that are here legally and not the bottom line of corporations. A better way to help corporations would be to lower the corporate tax rate significantly, so that these corporations will bring outsourced jobs back to this country and help the unemployed or underemployed American. In conclusion, I am opposed to any increase in the amount of time that foreign workers can stay to work jobs that are being taken away from Americans that are here legally.
