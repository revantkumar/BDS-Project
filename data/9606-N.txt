When reading this bill and accompanying analysis it appears that it is giving American jobs to foreigners and that more than 430,000 Americans have been denied jobs. Our fellow Countrymen and women should come first before people who are not American citizens. I also notice that the OPT program has stolen $4,000,000,000.00 from American's Social Security and Medicare trust funds. This is wrong! 
I also understand that the government is giving financial incentives to hire non-American workers.
This is wrong!

Please stop this program now!
