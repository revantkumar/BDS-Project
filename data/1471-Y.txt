I think this statement is very necessary. Today in America we have millions immigrations to do a lot of work for us Americans especially in IT and Engineering. I have to say, American don't like to do those work, if we lost them we can't find so many people to do the work. All the web service will be shut down and we will face a serious situation, we will not have the convenient life as we have today. 
I worked as IT trainer for about 10 years. I taught many American students, India students, Asian students. India students and Chinese students are smarter and they work harder than most of American students. So I believe that they are very important for America. IT has played a big role In today's economy environment, those foreigners make a lot of tax for us but get very low pay. So we definitely need them.
