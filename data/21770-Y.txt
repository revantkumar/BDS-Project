This new role is beneficial to the United State in many ways, I strongly approve of it.

1. This rule will help attract more foreign student to pursue their study here in the America. The tuition they pay and their living expense help contribute to the domestic economy.

2. Skilled and good student could participate in high-level research project, which will help boost our technology development and science advancement.

3. It encourages better communication between different countries and culture. Let them know about our values, and introduce good things to them

For those who is extremely worried about this rule deriving jobs opportunity from local American, this is not the case.
Companies hire the most suitable worker for themselves, if they can find a qualified local worker, they will do it because a local resident is less likely to move away from his/her role in the companies, while a foreign worker is at the risk of not getting work permission or planing to go home now and then. Any personnel change in a company is costly.
Further more, if company really failed to fill their jobs opening, they might seek talents in other countries, or moving to the other country entirely, which will be a very bad thing to the U.S economy.

Therefore, this rule is necessary for keeping the competence of our country.
Americans, don't be blinded, there're a lots of rivals out there trying to surpass us.
