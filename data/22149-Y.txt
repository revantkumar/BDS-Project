America is a country of immigrants. It should welcome foreign students! They spent thousands of dollars on their tuition and why are we so mean for not granting them OPT? Shouldn't they apply what they have learnt from school in the industry? Granting them 24 months of STEM OPT is not equal to granting them Green Card. Those are two different topics! 

Again, I strongly agree with OPT STEM extension!
