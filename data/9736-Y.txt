The 24 month extension policy will not only benefit the whole US economics but also give STEM student a great chance to gain experience in industry. There are hundreds of thousand international STEM students in US now, they work so hard in school to find a job after graduation. I am one of them. As a electrical engineering student, I work seven days a week without break, I try to do as much research as I can on campus. One main purpose of those hard working is that I want to have a good job after graduation. If OPT does not extend to 36 months, many employers will not hire us, in that case, how can we gain practical experience? I believe a main attractive advantage for foreigner student is they can have good practical experience in USA after graduation. The 36 months OPT will definitely attracts more student coming to USA for education, which will do much benefits to all Americans. I am very excited to see this OPT extension passing soon. Thank you all for your hardworking.
