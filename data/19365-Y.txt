The OPT extension policy states that "DHS continues to believe that practical training is frequently a key element of F-1 students' educational experience, and that STEM students in particular may benefit from an extended period of time in practical training." I highly agree with this statement. I have seen negative impact of this in our lab. 

In our lab, a post-doc left before completing her project as she has used up her OPT practical training time. Now, a PhD student is taking on her work. But sometimes, he is not sure about the conditions of the experiment that the post-doc carried out. So, he needs to send email to her to ask. This is very inefficient. It is uncertain how long it will take for post-doc to reply. This is just one thing that makes the project lag behind. Both professors and the PhD students are worried if this project is till worth pursuing.
