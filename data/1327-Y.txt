This 24-month extension is very reasonable. I really don't understand why some aggressive people treat international students as kind of robbers. No companies decide to hire an international student just because they are foreigners...The hiring decision is based on the candidates' abilities instead of their nationalities and the hiring process is fair and without any discrimination. All the development of STEM areas benefit from the strong and diverse human resource market. The companies will choose the one who can make good contributions to their firms and their cultures. 

The most common reason from the oppose comments is about the job opportunities for American citizens...This point is totally out of sense. So non-New Yorkers cannot stay in NY and get a job because they take too much opportunities away from New Yorkers? So women should just stay in home and take care of babies just because male will lose some working opportunities if competing with women?

This regulation is just ensuring the STEM areas will have more employee options, which of course is a good thing for those fields, and the US. It doesn't change the standards of hiring.
