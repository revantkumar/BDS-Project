I do support this extension.1.) This extended OPT STEM rule will benefit both F-1 students as well as most high technology companies, which contributed hugely to U.S economy and GDP. Those high tech companies spend big efforts and time training their high tech human capitals. If the OPT only can last one year, it means most if their training efforts will be lost and the human resource turnover could be really high.With this new rule, companies can hire an F-1 non-immigrant student for up to 3 years which definitely will benefit production and boom US economy much more. 2.)In additional, most of the F-1 non-immigrant students take the jobs related to high tech, physics and chemistry, which is the area that a few local students take. So F-1 non-immigrant students will not compete directly to local american job seeker. Their working area even does not have any overlapping. 3.) It s the American spirit to give everyone equal opportunity and talented students who come to US study deserve more time to contribute their talents not only to US economy but also to improve the technology and science improvement for the whole world and whole people who live on the earth.
