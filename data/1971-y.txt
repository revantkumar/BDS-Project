NISHANTH VOLAM I really support this new rulemaking because the amount of OPT period available to the F-1 students was crucial for me when I was deciding to pursue Masters in the US. I think adding an extension of 24 moths to the 12 months period of OPT provides an ample of time for the students to gain the practical knowledge, satisfying the actual purpose of OPT.

As this extension would be applicable to students with degrees in STEM (which have a large impact on the US economy) I feel it will be an advantage for students, employers and the US economy.
