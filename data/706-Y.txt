Hello,
I strongly support the further extension of 17 months OPT to 24 months. This will give a lot of relief to the international students in United States as they can gain the practical experience and also will not have to worry about the visa expiration before even applying for H1-B. I kindly request that if this rule is implemented, it will benefit both the students and the U.S. companies5t as well as economy.
