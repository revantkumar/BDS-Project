I think United States should be a country that welcomes everyone from all over the world. It should be a country of opportunity and hope. If you allow more International tech students to work in US, it's going to improve the welfare for the whole human race, because US has the most advanced technology, the best political system and most diversified culture. I believe the people working in this country have the ability to change impossible to possible. So please make the right decision.
