The STEM extension has been a blessing for many international students who have invested in and continue to invest in America to further their educational and professional needs. These individuals come to this country to take advantage of the best educational system in the world, and American businesses in turn benefit from a tremendous pool of highly skilled and educated workers who positively impact the economy. 

The OPT and the STEM OPT have been crucial pathways for these individuals to continue to remain in and contribute to the American economy. They face ever increasing competition from overseas businesses who take advantage of the H1 program and spam thousands of temporary workers into America who only mean to stay for a short amount of time (<5 years or the duration of their H1's). International students however, have already assimilated to the American way of life and overwhelmingly decide to stay in the country for a longer period of time. Many have gone on to get their permanent residency and citizenship. 

This STEM extension proposal is a good step by the DHS to attract and keep these highly skilled/ talented individuals over unassimilated/ unskilled temporary workers for overseas corporations who are a burden on this country over the long run.
