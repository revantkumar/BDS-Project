I feel that we should be giving our kids and older legal Americans those jobs. We need to make companies have to pay the going rate for wages, and quit allowing them to hire illegals who are willing to take less. Every time that this type of hiring is done, brings along other issues, such as too many aliens being allowed to live in one place all at once, they are taking so much from Medicaid and Food stamps, leaving legal Americans not being qualified for those services, but giving an abundance to illegal immigrants. This also leaves no job positions for we legal Americans whom need jobs, healthcare, and homes. My vote is NO!!!No should be everyone(s) VOTE
