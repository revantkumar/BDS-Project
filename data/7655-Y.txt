I support this rule strongly because of the following reasons:
1. This rule is beneficial to US economics because their family are going to US for travel and shopping when they come to visit.
2. US supported so many talented international students. This rule keep the talented students to work for US where they can make full use of their ability.
3. Longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in US. Thus will improve the development of academic and industry.
