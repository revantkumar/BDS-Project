I think this is not just benefiting the highly educated legal immigrants. As a matter of fact, it will benefit the US technology and economy more than those students. The government spent and will continue to spend tremendous amount tax money on advancing technology. A huge portion of those money is going to universities as research fund, and part of that is used to support foreign students. If the government doesn't help those highly educated students to stay after they graduate, then they have no choice but go back home and contribute to their home economy. So, you spend all these money and resources just to help train all these great engineers for someone else? 

Realistically speaking, how many American students are there in the graduate school for engineering and basic science nowadays? Don't forget what keeps this country so advanced and attractive to everyone in the world and what is the core competitive advantage of a country. Training all these students and sending them away, what is left for US? This is common sense to me.
