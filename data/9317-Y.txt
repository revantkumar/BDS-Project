I support Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students because of the following reasons:

1. Without OPT Expanding, tens of thousands of high tech talents will lose their legal status to work at USA and this will have a huge impact on many Industries especially high-tech industry. Many high-tech companies hire lots of international students who are playing very important and irreplaceable roles in these companies and contributing a lot to the high-tech development of USA. If OPT extension is not allowed, these companies will loose their talented employees right away.

2. Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students is a win-win situation for both the international students and USA as the students got the chance to gain industry experience after they graduate from school and USA gain a lot from the contribution these top talents make to its economy and technology development.

3. If we fail to improve and ExpandTraining Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees, USA will not be as attractive as before to the international students as a country to study aboard as they no longer got enough time/opportunities to gain enough industry experience after they finish their study in US. However, the industry experience is what most of the international care most about their studying aboard. Once USA loses its appeal among the international talents, there will be a big regression in USA's economy and technology development.
