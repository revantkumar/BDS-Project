For hundreds of years, the United States has benefited from these talented immigrants, who devoted their youth and talent for this great country's prosperity. Lots of the most shining names (like Albert Einstein) in American history actually belong to these immigrants. Without their contribution, the US is impossible to be the most powerful country like today. If the US wants to keep its status, please keep these high quality 'foreign' students. OPT extension gives these young students a chance to work for the US. 
It is not right to treat these students as people who take jobs from US citizens, because actually they also can help create more jobs for US citizens by promoting American economy growth. What's more, jobs available for F1 students are quite limited because US citizens are still the first choice for almost all the companies in the US. Cancelling OPT extension will not create more jobs for US citizens, but the dead economy and outflow of talent will definitely make more people lose their jobs.
