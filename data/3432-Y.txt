I strongly support this proposal. As we all know, STEM F-1 students have enhanced United States economy a lot. They bring their knowledge and skills to US, and use them to create value for this country. A lot of them start their own companies here, and create a lot of job opportunities. Some organization said that the opt extension of STEM F-1 students makes US citizens difficult to land a job. This is unfair. They deliberately ignored the value STEM F-1 students have created.

Thus, considering the great benefits of the opt extension, I am strongly in favor of this proposal.
