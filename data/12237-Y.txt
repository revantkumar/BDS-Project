I strongly SUPPORT this proposal because of a win-win strategy for both the United State and international students. 

Firstly, the international students make a huge contribution to US and instead of decreasing pay level, they greatly improve it. In other words, they start the companies where many job opportunities have been provided and then pay lots of taxes. 

What's more, there is no relation between international student and the lowest pay level and the international student should not be responsible for the stagnation of software and Internet industry. The real reason is the outsourced work and decreasing of industry development. The former is caused because the international students are not allowed to stay here and some companies try to hire low-cost foreign programmer without study abroad experience. The latter is led by the reduce of creativity, which is caused by these international students going back to their hometown. 

Finally, allowing international student to stay US is beneficial to the vital interests of American people. As you know, in most big companies in Silicon Valley, lots of productivity and creativity are created by these international stuff. If these international resources are affected and drove out of America, many industries will be subject to negative influences. For instance, in China, most creative leaders in IT field have the abroad experience and after they went back to China, they started their own companies and have been making great contributions to the countries such as Tecent, Baidu and Alibaba. If the United States can make these talented persons stay here, use their creativity and make contributions for America, US will be more and more powerful.
