This extension on OPT is really really necessary for students who want to seek employement opportunities here in the US. It gives them sufficient time to contribute to US's economy while growing personally and professionally using the knowledge that they have acquired by working very hard and spending a lot of money that they have saved in their home country over so many years. It is a win-win for both students and the US as more and more skilled workers means better output, means that the economy will improve substantially. The student on the other hand gets real knowledge from his/her course work and also has ample time to put it into practice.

I support this rule and it is very crucial that it gets passed really quickly so that the students do not lose out opportunities.
