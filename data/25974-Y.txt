This rule is beneficial to both US people and foreigners.

It's fair competition instead of 'stealing jobs from US people'. Just like free market can encourage creativity, an extended OPT can encourage more talented people to contribute to US technology and economy. 

Those Americans who are really smart and hardworking won't complain about this policy because they are confident that they can keep their jobs.
