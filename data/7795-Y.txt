David Hampton I think most of comments from our Americans are short-sightness! They are not in STEM field and think if foreigners expired, Americans will have work. That is really naive and their opinion prove we really need more educated people in our society to complement these short of intelligence. 

To be honest, we have seen some raising competitionist, like China and India, where most STEM student coming from. If we do not attract them to America and make their contribution, it did not only reduce our power, but also increase the power of our opponent. 

And now most US university are supported by the money from other country, in STEM field. They are not stupid, if they know they cannot even get an opportunity to work in U.S, why will they spend money to take a degree in U.S.. Without their money, most of university will go bankruptcy, and you know what, the stupid one who go against this extension, their children will not afford University!! Their children will lose jobs even more! And the high-tech company will break up as universities because they have no one applicable to work!!!
