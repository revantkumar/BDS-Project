How does this help the American People? The Immigration and Customs Enforcement Bureau (ICEB) Proposed Rule: Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students

Home Land Security -- what are you thinking? There are plenty of educated people in the United States that deserve to get those higher paying jobs and keep their standard of living. Since when is it more important to give our jobs to foreigners? It is sickening to hear you are not taking care of the home front. When businesses are making billions of dollars they can afford to pay higher cost to their technology department and train and hire American workers. When is enough ENOUGH? 
I have nothing against foreigners. But let's be realistic about this whole ruling. STOP IT. STOP IT. STOP IT.

When you bring in talent to bargain the jobs in the United States and an American goes unemployed who does that help? It is one more way the United States fails their own people. STOP IT! STOP IT! STOP IT. 
1.American IT Workers are displaced 
2.Social Security Fund is not being funded 
3.The Taxes are not being paid
4.The cost of living keeps going up in the United States 
5.The high paid jobs are going to Foreigners
6.Translates into United States losing their standard of living.
7.Companies are paying less and less 
8.Consumers are paying more
9.Stockholder get more and more 

I for one oppose this rule and the American People oppose. STOP IT!!!
This is nonsense to helping everyone but the American People who live here.
