I strongly support the proposal. As we all know, US put a lot of money into education every year, the main reason of providing updated technology and resources to all the students is to prepare this country to be more competitive in the global environment. It is definitely a wise idea to provide opportunity for international students to apply their knowledge to development of United Sates.
