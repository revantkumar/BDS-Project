I support this new rule, and I believe it will benefit both U.S. government, U.S. citizens and international students. The OPT extension and the Cap-Gap relief will not only help the international students to gain more applied experience and make more contribution to U.S., but also help alleviate the H-1B shortage which the employers are facing. 
After reading some of the comments, I found most people who opposed to this proposal usually took two false premises. 
First, it is not true that foreign students steal jobs from Americans. The most commonly used example was OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013. The second part of this sentence was 64,000 of which are in STEM fields. Some people said that it was evidential that foreign students stole Americans jobs. However, that is only part of the story. Notice that the numbers were cumulated from 2009 to 2013. In 2013 solely, there were 5.7 million openings in STEM fields, 4.4 million of which required at least a bachelors degree. At the same period of time (from 2012-2013 academic year), according to the National Center for Education Statistics, foreign students comprised 56.9% of all doctoral degrees in engineering; 52.5% of all doctoral degrees in computer and information sciences; 50% of all doctoral degrees in mathematics and statistics; and 40% of all doctoral degrees in physical sciences and science technologies. Similarly, half of all masters degrees in STEM field were comprised by foreign students. Proportionally, more than 2 million of jobs in STEM fields could be offered to foreign students in the year of 2013. But as a matter of fact, there were only 64,000 jobs were taken by foreign students in 4 years, which also means that the employers only selected the most talent foreign students in their fields. Furthermore, according to NAFSA, international students and their families created or supported 340,000 jobs during the 2013-2014 academic year (only one year). So it is
