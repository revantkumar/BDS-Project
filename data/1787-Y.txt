Mike Wang I truly believe that the OPT extension will do good for the US economy because it will allow many intelligent students with higher education in STEM to truly contribute their skills and make an impact on technology. On the other hand, we definitely do not have enough work force domestically to supply the rapidly increasing need for STEM graduates in various field. Being overprotective in this matter can drastically hurt US's ability to inonnvate and its leadership in technology in the world. Furthermore, it could pose US as a unfriendly country for students who are highly intellectual and well educated, and defer them from studying abroad in USA in the first place. Therefore, the OPT extension is imperative to US economy and its chance of attracting brilliant intellectuals in the future and we must pass this so that our children do not have to suffer from the mistakes we made.
