Hi,

I would say its better to approve green cards for the people who have done masters in U.S. As every student come here to study and improve their practical experience on their fields.where most of the jobs are belongs to green card and Citizen ship holders. it difficult to get the job here for the people who have done masters where they issue OPT Card. The OPT Card is least bothered by any company. If DHS wants to encourage foreign students in the name of talented international students . i would say approving green cards to the students is the best way to encourage any student in u.s.
