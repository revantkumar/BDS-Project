The Dep.of Homeland Security should do there homework about F-1 Visas. It should be up to the Congress to make changes in the law, not the Obama administration. What the business world wants is to long. and they should pay Social Security - Medicare taxes.When one considers all the student debt in the system, there should be away to hire some legal residents. Yet , its higer educations fault that possibly some foreign could be more qualified. Sincerely, Gary
