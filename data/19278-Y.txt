I agree to the OPT extension.

As a graduate student in the United States, pursuing a STEM degree, I found most of my classmates are international students. If you look around in a high-tech corporation, you can also easily realize that most of people with high level STEM degree such as M.S. Computer Science are international students.

After talking to my american friends, I was told that most american citizens prefer to study in Art/Medicine/Law..., except STEM majors to get a related job in those area after they graduated, such as being a lawyer. 

I believe their personal choices are a big reason of why most of people majored in Science/Technology/Engineer/Mathematics are international students.

As well known as that technology improvement is very crucial to a country's development, the United States needs people doing technical work like Analyst/Engineer/Accountant as well as Artist/Doctor/Lawyer. However, international students who are willing to learn Science/Technology/Engineer/Mathematics and work in those area to keep the United States developing in the future are limited authorized to work in the United States. Because the F1 visa, which is issued to international students don't permit them to work in the United States. Most international students need to apply for H1B visa to legally work in the United States after they got a job offer. Whereas the applications for H1B is harder and harder to be selected, most international students need longer time OPT to allow them working in the United States during their long time waiting for H1B visa. 

There can be chaos in the future as the H1B visa is hard to get and the OPT period is not long enough while the american corporations are desperate seeking candidates with a STEM degree.

All in all, in my opinion, the OPT extension is very necessary to permit those international students who have a STEM degree work in the United States and develop the United States with what they have learned from this country.
