OPT extension is ABSOLUTELY needed. The fact that H1B is going for a lottery for three consecutive years speaks for itself the dire need for this rule in the absence of parliament failing to pass an immigration law. 17 month extension rule was initially implemented as an emergency rule because of H1B lottery. And the situation has not changed. USCIS is still holding lottery to give work permits to even PHD degree holders.
Those who claim that STEM workers are stealing the jobs of American workers should wonder why there is no such rule for other non-STEM fields like Medicine, law practice etc. This speaks for itself that there is a huge shortage in US for STEM workers. Absence of such rule will only mean acute business loss for US.
