I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S..

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. A lot of people who are powerful and contributed a lot to the U.S. are international students. 

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. It is a general idea that natural selection does exist nowadays. International students are not paying low in order to steal the opportunities of Americans'. However, competition can help raise the standards of people, which means can help improve U.S. economics. 

Therefore, I strongly support the proposal.
