I strongly support 24 months extension for STEM OPT students because 

1 Protectionism doesn't help economy, it hurts the labor market and make the labor force less competitive against a increasingly integrated global economy.

2 Highly skilled labors are sought after in many different countries, we should try to keep them here and contribute to the US economy.

3 After these students develop applicable professional skills and go back to their home country, they serves as ambassors to bring in international trade and collaboration

4 A better economy means more jobs. it is not a zero-sum game where foreigners compete with American workers for limited jobs. Highly skilled foreign workers contribute by creating more jobs that is available for American workers. It is working together instead of working against each other.

5 Everyone is enjoying the fruits of technological development, such as iPhones, Google, Facebook, better cancer treatment options, greener energy.. Many of these cannot be realized without the contribution of professionally trained high skill STEM graduates from abroad. Imagine we may be sending the next Einstein back to his home country.
