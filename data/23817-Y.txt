I SUPPORT the OPT program because it help American people get more jobs as opposed to less jobs. The more excellent international students came to the USA for tech related job, the more advance technical products are created. Also there will be more invention. Such inventions will create new market that will bring much more jobs than before. So it is of American people's benefit to allow more good international student come and help them build a better market.
