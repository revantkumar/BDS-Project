I strongly oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training Program. This basically entices U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans by artificially expanding the pool of available workers which allows employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes. It is no secret that today our college graduates, along with many other Americans, are experiencing great difficulty in securing jobs. This is not the time to put forth an immigration policy that provides companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.
