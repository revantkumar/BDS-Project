Dear citizens; data, economics, and policy!

It seems that most of the comments on here are from aliens/foreigners/non-residents who would like to see the program kept and extended which is understandable.

On the other hand, the US lets in some ONE MILLION people every year on a permanent basis. The vast majority came in on some family-sponsorship which is a relatively straight forward procedure. My point is that t
