I am glad to see this rule gets so many comments. Many negative comments here are actually blaming unrelated issues. This is not about illegal immigration, this is not about low skilled workers competing for minimum salary jobs, and these students will be working to provide benefit for us, not consuming social welfare. 

No matter from a short term or long term perspective, we need this rule to be passed. In the short term, losing all OPT workers and prospective OPT workers will be unbearable to the tech industry; and in the long term we are in danger of back draining talents and losing our leadership position in science and technology. 

Some have argued it is unfair for US STEM students to compete with foreign students. The fact is there is a huge demand for high skilled workers, so qualified students will be hired. Also, the competition is indeed unfair, but strongly favors US citizens. The overhead cost and paperwork means no company will hire foreign workers unless they truly need to. It is also the right attitude to shut the door when there are some healthy competition. My daughter is a college student and her best friend is a foreign student. When you get to know them personally, they are no different from any one of us. Open the door, learn from each other, nobody gets hurt.
