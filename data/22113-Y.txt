I strongly support the proposal. 

First, many F1 students study in US with support from US colleges and universities. I think it's unfair to let them go back to serve their country after WE spent large amount of money training them.

Another consideration is for my uncle. He owned a small company mainly provide financial service to local residents. He need people managing the data base for him. It is a boring job and requires huge amount of knowledge of computer and math. Not many American people like and be able to do this job. Fortunately, he found some International students competent for this job. It is a convenience to him. His company is very small, so it is very difficult for him to support employee for H1B. STEM is a very good solution to him. He can use persons with STEM to work for him and make his company run well and serve our community.
