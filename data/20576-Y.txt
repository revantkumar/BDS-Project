I support the OPT extension because it allows the student to achieve an adequate level of training for their profession. Take a second to think about the positives; progressing the future of the nation and ultimately the world. Students who were motivated enough to leave their own country should be given the opportunity to contribute to the receiving country. This act would allow their goals to be achieved alongside those in the United States who have similar goals.
