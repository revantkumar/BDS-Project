I totally support this policy, not only because I am a F-1 student, but also it is about everyone should has the equal right to work in here.The more skillful guys get more opportunity, especially on IT field.
F-1 students get one year to work in America, but normally, a student needs several months to collect and improve their portfolio. Then get a job, work several months and prepare to leave. It even has no time to finish a completed project. 
Companies want to seize man with strong ability. More working time definitely can improve the society. It is not about local people or foreigner. It is all about personal ability.
