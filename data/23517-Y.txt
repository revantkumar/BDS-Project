OPT extension helps to keep those talented students educated and funded by U.S..

I am talking about those international Ph.D. students in STEM funded by the government and the universities. They are important talents that help to maintain the leading position of U.S. in engineering around the world. U.S. should spend every effort to keep these talents, especially we have already invested a large sum to educate them. OPT extension is helpful for them to explore more that can be offered in their field, so that they keep contributing to our society. They are talents being valued all around the world, and we should try to keep them with all effort.
