I strongly support the OPT extension. First of all, all the foreign students that are eligible being considered as future employees are very highly educated, intelligent and hardworking people. The open positions for them in most U.S company are high level researchers, IT experts,advanced engineers and scientists, we have to admit that those well-qualified people are very hard to find, some of them are best of the best in the field ,literally in the world. Thus they will provide invaluable resources to boost scientifical and technological power of the U.S. Also we can not ignore the economical influence that the foreign students have brought to the country. When considering them as competed with U.S citizens,we need to see that most of the jobs that they qualify are high-level technical jobs that not so many American people are actually interested in. Thus the extention program will not displace U.S workers. Actually recent reports have shown foreign emplyees have promoted significant job growths. Lastly, America is a country that always emphasize equality of people, forcing foreign students to pack their bags and leave is definitely not a way to justify this belief.
