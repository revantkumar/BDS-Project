OPT extension, WHY NOT? First of all, OPT is an very important element to attract international students, whom pay much tuition to support US colleges. Second, actually not enough native Americans would like or be able to work in STEM, especially IT field. However, those talented international students who are in OPT status could give a huge contribution to the US high-tech field, so why don't US government give them, also give yourself an opportunity to develop both your technology and economy? Also, the US is known and respected for your diversity and inclusiveness, because of these, more people come here to contribute them to the society, thus, the US can have today's international standing and prestige. All in all, I don't think OPT extention will hurt Americans benifits, nevertheless, it wil have lots of positive impacts to the country.
