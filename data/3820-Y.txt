Saldaa, the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, "U,S. employers will benefit from the increased ability to rely on the skills acquired by U.S. educated-STEM students, as well as their knowledge of markets in their home countries." Rejecting the talents can't help technology growth or keep creativity alive.
