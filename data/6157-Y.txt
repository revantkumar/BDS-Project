Carrie Elizabeth Gilson I strongly support the STEM OPT extension policy!

As a Director of Quantitative Analytics in a big national commercial bank, I really appreciate the help from many international student employees, who have majors in STEM field (e.g. Statistics, Computer Science). It's really regretful to lose many of them because of H1B lottery issue each year. STEM OPT extension is a very important policy to give more chances to these talents to continue their US career. It will post a huge and inestimable loss to our industries (not only Banks!) and economy if we lose them.

Therefore, I support the policy and hope you chould execute this policy as soon as possible.
