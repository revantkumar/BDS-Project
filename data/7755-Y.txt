The Honorable Jeh Johnson
Secretary of Homeland Security
Washington, D.C. 20528

Dear Mr. Johnson:

I write to you regarding the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. I am an international student at the Jackson State University(JSUMS). I and many of my colleagues will be strongly affected by the Proposed Rule.

I strongly SUPPORT Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I'm particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months.
I am planning to use OPT after graduation and
I am glad my international colleagues are able to gain practical training experience in the US because 
it gives us practical knowledge of the subjects which we learn at school. 
OPT and OPT extension is important to be because i would love to gain practical knowledge and apply my skills to make world a better place.

I am very concerned with the possibility that the ability of students to make use of the STEM OPT Extension might be disrupted by recent court actions, upcoming court actions, and delays in this rulemaking process. I commend DHS for working quickly to prepare this new Proposed Rule.

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule and thank you for all of your hard work in keeping America safe and providing educational and training opportunities to F-1 students and constantly evolving and working hard to make world a better place to live. GOD BLESS AMERICA.
