I highly support this proposal for the following reasons:

1. Giving the visa extension will allow our tech company have more free room to hire the real talented employees which will make these company grow fast.

2. The talented foreign employees could make more profit for the whole society than illegal immigrants and it means more tax and less spending on maintaining.

3. This visa could attract more foreign students to continue their study in US which will make profit to most of the cities.
