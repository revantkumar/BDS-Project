I am an aspiring student for earning my Master Degree and I support this rule as in void of this rule, I might have to alter my decision to pursue Master's from an US university. We aim to achieve quality education, which cannot be completed without proper training afterwards and circumstances share a significant amount of credit in that. Learning under pressure of leaving the country in one year is burdensome. I wish to see a final rule resulting in win-win situation for both the students and the country without hampering US economy.
