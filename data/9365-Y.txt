I strongly agree and support the new STEM extension rule. International students come to study and get some real world experience. US have always been supportive to international students with respect to learning and earning. This rule will not only help the students but also helps in increase in overall economy of the country. Talented students who earn their degree in USA should be given a chance to prove themselves and give back the country. I don't see any reason why and how this will impact the american workforce. In united states, people are not judged by their degree but on their talent, education and experience. Statistics will show the contribution of STEM students in improving the overall economy. According to NAFSA, in 2013-2014 academic year, international students contributed around $26.8 billion to united states and nearly an increase in 12% US economy. If STEM rule is rejected, there will be a major impact to students and corporate world which will directly impact the economy.
