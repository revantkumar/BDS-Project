Qin Zhong I definitely support this extension. This opportunity gives international students more time to have better experience in the most industrialized country.
This extended OPT STEM rule will benefit both the F1 students and the U.S. technology companies. Those companies usually spend few months to train new hires and if new hires leave the company only after one year, the company needs to look for replacement. With the new rule, companies can hire an F1 non-immigrant student for up to 3 years which will benefit production. 
With this rule, the colleges and universities in US will attract more international students and more intelligent students will come to US for better education and longer work experience. Its good for US economy to have talented people work in high technologies companies.
