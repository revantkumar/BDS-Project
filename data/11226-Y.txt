I strongly agree with the DHS new rule about the 24 opt STEM extension. Based on my work experience in the US. I believe that 12 months opt is too short for us to learn. Mostly, a project will not be finished in a year. For example, in my company, which is a electrical company, our group have to design for at least 2-3 years in order to bring a new project to the market. If my opt stops in 12 months, in one hand, I cannot go though the whole project and get a good learning, on the other hand it will delay our project. One of the most important reason that I came to the US for my graduate school is that I could get a good training after graduation. If the training is not useful and worth, more and more international students will think over it and may not choose US for their education. So that the US will loss not only the money but also talents to help the development. In the long term, this will effect the US's economy and future!
