I totally SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..

2. The students have paid a large amount of tuition fees for study, so they deserve to have the right to gain some work experience and apply what they have learned to practice.
