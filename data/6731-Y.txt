I strongly support this proposal.Over the years, foreign tech workers contributed huge growth to the USA economy. If USA lose this force, USA loses a large portion of growth that the foreign workers bring about. Without policies like OPT-extension, it would just be a matter of time before USA becomes another mundane country where miracles no longer happen. Without embracing foreign workers, I can for-see someday very soon when USA economy stagnates, people lose jobs, and social problems arises. DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN. APPROVE the OPT-extension.
