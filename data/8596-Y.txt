Xiaochen Bian I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. Most students who can come to the US and study are the best in their own countries. These students are very smart. So we really need these smart people in STEM fields.
2. International students always needs less salary and have more output in work.
3. We have to admit that competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. US citizens are not afraid of competition. And this kind of competition will make both international and native workers work harder.
So I strongly agree with this proposal.
