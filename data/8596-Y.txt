A few facts about me: As an immigrant and an OPT employee if this rule can't make it to 12 February, I will be out of status and need to leave the country and need to quit my highly paid job but still I would like to remind US government the followings:

- Most of STEM students take huge loans to get education here and on average we can assume that it would take 2-3 years for immigrants to pay for it. If there is no chance of paying back the loans, I would expect a significant fall in the number of such students, in the end these students are creating a huge market in the states, paying for school, eating, living, entertainment ...

- Most of the time it is claimed that we, immigrants, are the highly talented people but is it really the case? I can understand this for people who got accepted to PhD programs but for the rest, most of the time, it is just if you pay you get into the school. And since the extra money being paid by immigrants to these schools are significant sources of funding for universities, they tend to accept immigrants with ease. Except PhD graduates, these reasons would eliminate the claim that STEM candidate immigrants are highly talented people.

- The companies are paying less taxes for STEM employees which reduces the cost of hiring immigrants. For sure there are risks involved with hiring STEM people like them being out of status in the middle of an important project BUT how many of these people are working in this long term projects? Most of the time the high tech industry don't let STEM workers be involved in long term projects. If a chance for 36 months of granted OPT is given, the companies would just keep hiring immigrants and this would help them avoid paying much more money to more experienced fellows, most of the time American citizens because immigrants leave the country at some point. We all know that if person A and B are capable of doing the work, the one who costs less will be hired.

- The ethnic diversity of USA should be cons
