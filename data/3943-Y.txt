Alexandra Graham You must be aware about thousands of dollars international students pore in the US economy every year by paying huge international fees. This new rule will bring global perspectives into U.S. classrooms and research labs. There is no doubt that to advance our economy and our society we need to create the next great technology innovations, not just consume them. That's why there is such urgency for the U.S. to develop a stronger workforce of experts in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). According to the U.S. Department of Labor, only 5% of U.S. workers are employed in fields related to science and engineering, yet they are responsible for more than 50% of our sustained economic expansion. STEM-related disciplines are responsible for many of the societal innovations that make our world better.
