I strongly support expanding OPT for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees.

OPT provides a good opportunigy for international students to practice what they have learned during the graduate study. A longer OPT period will surely make the graduate programs more attractive for these students. A higher enrollment number of international students will not only greatly increase the income and improve the education quality of universities, but also brings more income to local community via rental apartments, resturants, etc.

Aside from these, international employees play a very important roles in a lot of US companies. A longer OPT period increases the opportunity to find a job for these students. Without the 24-month OPT extension, a lot of companies will lose a large number of core employees, such as Google and Facebook, which will bring a very hugh damage to US economy.
