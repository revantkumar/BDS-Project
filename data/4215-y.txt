Rajeev Reddy Gade I strongly support to make opt extension rule to foreign students. I am here to say about 2 things.
Even the U.S citizens have a lot of oppurtunities to do their higher studies, but total number of students who completing their under graduation is very less, and when comes to masters very few students completing their graduation. Where foreign students spends thousands of dollars as their education fees to complete their higher education over here. When MNC's need of higher educated students, how they can hire U.S citizens who are unable to complete their higher education, this makes them to recruite foreign students. This opt extension helps these foreign students to clear their education loans n make financialy good when they return back to their home country and they pay high amount of taxes to US government.
Secondly, no foreign student is illegal over here, they go through a long process in their home countries to get their F-1 visas at US Embassy.They are not an illegal immigrants.
Thanks to every one who are supporting for OPT extensions.
