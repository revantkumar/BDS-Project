I strongly support this extension.

The United States of America is founded by the people from all over the world. Several hundreds year ago, people from all other countries came to this land to seek their dreams. At that time, they didn't need to worried about whether they had the authority to work here, how happy they are!

Why things change so tremendously? Why people hold the same dreams become more and more difficult to stay here? Why can't we have more time to realize our dream here?

There is no wiser proposal like this one. Don't be hesitated, approve it!
