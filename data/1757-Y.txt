I strongly support to improve and expand Training Opportunities for F1 students with STEM degrees (or even with non-STEM degrees). 

A lot of concerns from the negative comments are that the F1 students may take away the jobs that should be given to the US STEM workers and American students. However, the DHS has already proposed to modify the terms and conditions for employer participation in the STEM OPT extension to protect U.S. workers from possible employer abuses of these programs. As stated in the terms, the employer will not terminate, lay off, or furlough a US worker as a result of providing the STEM OPT to the student. Thus, those concerns from the negative comments are really unnecessary. By recruiting both hard-working and intelligent American and International students, the company will continue to expand its business and may even be easier to expand its business to the world, because the international students will bring new perspectives to the field. Not only will this creating more jobs domestic, but also will help to create more jobs worldwide. 

In conclusion, I strongly support this proposed rule to improve and expand OPT for F1 students as those concerns from negative comments are really not an issue.
