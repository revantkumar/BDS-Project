I strongly support this Rule.
With a Master Degree in Public Health, and an emphasis in Industrial Hygiene, three year work experience is the minimum requirement before I can be certified as a Certified Industrial Hygienist. The proposed OPT extension would make it possible.
What is an Industrail Hygienist? I use my expertise to help promote works' health & safety as well as the company's wellness program. Therefore, this Rule will not only benefit me (and other F-1 students with similar backgrounds), but also benefit the company and our workers.
