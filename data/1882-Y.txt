I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:
1 America has a good reputation for high quality educations and more talented students come means more contributions to the america economic.
2 Its not a conflict between the STEM OPT and american worker opportunities. With the contributions of the talented people, companies will grow faster and improve which will bring in more opportunities for american workers.
3 Companies in USA have equal quality principles and the foreign students should have the same opportunities to practice their skills after graduation.
