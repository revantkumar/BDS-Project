OPT will help today's America becomes a better America.

I know America as one of the best countries in history for several reasons:

America is open-minded, that's where the creativity and innovation comes. People here are always free to think, free to talk, free to implement great ideas in their mind. Most of the international students are top talents in their own country. They bring new thoughts and share these with Americans. America is benefiting from these young talents. The extension of OPT will give these young people more chances to provide their best knowlegde to help America. 

America has great law system and most of people here obey these rules. The outstanding law system is the cornerstone of the greatness of America. People who were complaining about OPT is mainly complaining about those informal companies which doesn't obey the rules. If we have a clearer and tighter supervising system for OPT policy, I believe there will be only little objections left. 

America does the real business, people here focus on values and contributions you make. Nobody is intentionally here to take the job opportunity away from locals. Actually it is harder for international students to survive on this land. We play fair games here. If the international talents are blocked from America by cancelling OPT policy today, they will still shine on other parts of the world. It would be a big loss for America. It just doesn't make sense that America provide good educational resources to international students and let them go with the skills.
