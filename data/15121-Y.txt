Alex Li STEM related industries are currently significant and most thriving part of U.S. economy and will continue to be the driving force in the future. There is no doubt a country will do its best to put fuel into this engine, attracting the brightest workers in the world to its side [1]. However, the supply of qualified workers for these industries is not enough. In 2013, there are 1.37 million entry-level STEM jobs opening for STEM bachelors degree or higher, while only 0.55 million STEM bachelor degrees were conferred, leaving 2.5 jobs each for STEM bachelor graduate [2]. International students with STEM degree make up a significant share in STEM workforce market since they obtain 56.9% of doctoral degree and 43% of master degree in engineering (similar percentage for other three STEM fields) conferred by U.S. colleges and universities [3]. There is no doubt that all domestic and foreign students in STEM field are in demand. 

The next question is that how long should a U.S. STEM company hires foreign STEM students. Since the OPT serve the purpose of benefiting two sides, the student and the company. As for a student to get training in the field and to be able to do some entry-level tasks in a company, one year of OPT might be just enough since the time spent on looking for a job and obtaining EAD card can take up to several months. Of course, a longer OPT period allows the student to find a job that fits even better his or her field of study, skills and interest. The student can get more training into a higher level of position in the company. As for the company, it certainly wants its employees to perform more advanced tasks and get involved into more projects. A one year in and out employee stream will be detrimental to interest of a STEM company. An extension can temporally solve this problem, allowing the company to turn its new hires into its assets.

Therefore, the OPT extension should be longer. Any policy that force international talents to leave the nation due to OPT extension limitation will jeopardize U.S. position as the global hub of innovation.
