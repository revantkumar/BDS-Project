I personally strongly agree with this amendment for OPT extension. This benefits not only for STEM students who can stay in the US longer to work and make contributions for their employers but also for those tech companies who need fresh eyes to develop and drive innovation and business growth for their companies.This is an absolutely win-win situation for STEM students and American economic development.
