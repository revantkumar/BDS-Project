Yuwei Yang I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the this reason:

USA could give student the OPT for practical training, that is why I chose to pursue my master degree in USA instead of other countries.

When I was an undergraduate student in China, I chose to study in UK at very first. But then my friend told me that USA provides international students with OPT, and it has the extension which means international students can get practical training for more than one year. Compared with UK, UK does not provide international students with this policy. So I changed my mind and wanted to study in USA.

HOWEVER, if OPT cannot be extended, that means I only can get training for one year here, which means I cannot get well trained here. I paid amount of tuition fee in USA, and want to be more professional in my area. But 12 months practical training is too short to get the experience in my area. When I go back to my country, I am not so competitive. If it is, why I choose to study in USA? I can totally choose any other countries to finish my master degree. 

Countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia are actively instituting new strategies to attract international students. Why USA cannot do it like this?

I hope that OPT can be extended so I can be well trained here, so in the future I can be more competitive to find a job in my country.

I SUPPORT this proposal!!!
