I strongly support the new regulation - Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students.

Firstly, the students who major in STEM in US have great potential to make contributions to the technology development for the US. If they cannot be provided with enough time and more opportunities to work for US, definitely it will lead to an unpredictable loss for this country.

Secondly, US is well-known for its open attitude towards the people from all over the world. However, it is hard to imagine that the students who major in STEM cannot get enough time to work for US after they graduate, since this definitely violates the spirit of US. What's more, some further bad consequences could happen -- there will be less students who want to pursue STEM majors in US, then the high-tech companies cannot hire competitive enough employees...finally it will hurt the economy of US.

All in all, based on the history, I firmly believe that those STEM students would make contributions not only to the technology development of US, but also will improve the economy of US and the social welfare of US citizens.
