Dear Chief Westerlund:

I would like to submit the following comments for the USICE Proposed Rule, Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students.

I support the new regulation for the following reasons.

Firstly, the job market is not a zero-sum game. The STEM students help to create more jobs for the local market. As a STEM student working for a local tech company in California, I have been working closely with other STEM students and local people to create values for our local economics. Our new project, which led by me, rocks the market in its field which creates new revenue to our company. We are planning to hire 3 more people locally to help to grow our new business. Im proud of my contribution to create more jobs here. 

Secondly, all my American friends at the college in my major(Electrical and Computer Engineering) got their jobs. In the field of computer science and electrical engineering which is hot at this moment, students who worked hard and did good preparation finally got a job. It doesnt matter he/she is a local American or an international student. People are judged by their competence. And the new rule has clearly stated that hiring an OPT student should not at the expense of sacrificing a position for American, which means Americans jobs are actually protected by the new regulation. 

Therefore, this regulation is beneficial to both the international students and the local Americans. 

Sincerely,

-Jaroslav
