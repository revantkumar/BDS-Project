Hongen Xie I support the extension of OPT. As an international student, I would like to have a chance to practice what I have learnt in school. At the same time, international students can contribute to the work force of American companies. 

I think American companies still prefer to employ Americans so that they can save a lot of troubles such as documents, possible communication problems,etc. The reason why they recruit international student is that they cannot find sufficient number of American students who have the desired skills.So I do not think that the extension of OPT will reduce the chance for an American student to find a job. And I have not heard any of my American classmates complaining about failing to find a job.
