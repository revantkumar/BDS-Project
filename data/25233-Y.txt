I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

First of all, as a potential student who wanna go to the America to study next year, extension of OPT is a key factor in my consideration. If the environment of job market is not positive in the America, I'd rather stay in our country instead of studying in the America. And I believe that I am not the single person who hold this opinion. Thus, extending OPT will encourage more students to study in the America which will bring more money to the universities and largely promote the development of the universities.

In addition, there is no reason to expel the talents who have been cultivated by universities. There are many people with great talent are forced to go back their own countries and made a great contribution to their own countries. If they can stay in the America, there is no doubt that they can not only make a significant contribution to America but also create more work opportunity to native America instead of taking their jobs away.
