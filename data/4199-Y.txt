I support this further extension of STEM.

Nowadays, the income of education system from international students has been increasing and becoming a big part for US federal income. The extension of STEM will certainly attract more students coming to US for good education since to pursuing good career is the main purpose of going the school.

In addition, attracting more students will also increase the income of local universities, colleges and institutions. Thus could improve the education condition of local students as well.
