I strongly support this OPT extension policy for STEM student.

First, two year practical training time is more reasonable for a STEM student compared to other majors. As a student in Electrical Engineering, I can say we usually need more than two years to complete a well-finished project, since the whole procedure, which includes bringing up ideas, doing research finding solutions, prototype design and fabrication, testing, etc, really requires a long period of time. It's really meaningless and waste of time and resource to change working people during the mid-term of the project, no matter for the student or the company or the school.

Second, as a foreign student came to study here, one of the biggest perks that attracts me here is the operational practical training it offers. I was also considering German where tuition fee is free, or Japan where working-study environment is more friendly for foreign students at that time. I finally chose to come here because of the diversity, open culture and the practical training offered here. And every time somebody asked me my opinion about study abroad, I strongly encourage them consider coming study here because of this. But if the OPT for STEM expansion or the whole OPT is cancelled, it will greatly decrease the worthiness of study in the U.S., and next time being asked suggestion again, I might ask them to think about it more carefully.
