I am writing to express my strong support of the proposal - expanding the OPT for F1 students with STEM degrees and Cap-gap relief for all eligible F1 students, for the following reasons:

1. The U.S. might be the last and only place these young people should go to, when they have a passionate dream about life and career, about innovation and entrepreneurship. We all feel want to do something, at a platform that provides the equity and freedom that allow us to dig out our fullest potential. For those who migrate far across the ocean, the choice was not easy - it's a bold mind that keeps us chasing for the dream. Human society needs such innovation and rely on the brilliant minds for advancement, and there is no reason that certain mechanism should turn this down. This is the spirit of not only the USA, but also the essence of us human civilizations' progression and flourishing.

2. U.S. provides the best environment for STEM subject technicians, researchers and students to delve into the field of their interests, whether in academia, or in private sector (which emphasizes more on transforming the patents and knowledges created in lab and research papers into something useful for daily life or society as a whole). These are ultimately beneficial for the America as a whole and such indirect benefit largely outweighs any potential downside of keeping the STEM students and scholars in the country.
