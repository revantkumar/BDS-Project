My wife graduated from a top US university with PhD in Bio-statistics early this year. She got multiple job offers and chose to join a bio-tech company in St. Louis working on bioinformatics targeting at developing personalized medicine. Unfortunately, She had no luck with the H1B lottery during April, mainly due to fierce competition from ridiculous amount of applicants hired by so-called ICC. If my wife can't extend her OPT early 2016, we will need to go back to our home country or she will end up being a housewife. Remember, she was granted a full scholarship at around $45,000 per year by a US university during her six year training in the PhD program. If she can't work and contribute to the US, what has been invested on her, around $250,000, will be totally wasted. 

I truly don't know why people who get educated in the US, have been valued in the US job market, and perform well in the STEM fields can't be granted the right to work.They are also pushed to join a unfair battle for the H1B visa with thousands of thousands people living in other countries, especially India, who fraud during the H1B application process with the help from ICC. 

In all, the twenty-four months OPT extension is a must. Beyond that, current H1B selection process also needs to be assessed and improved to filtering out those are truly unqualified.
