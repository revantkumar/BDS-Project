Zach Kaiser I totally support the proposed rule. Here is my comment on this issue based on my own experience.

I received my Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from a Top 10 U.S. university. During my 5 years at graduate school, I received full scholarship (tuition waiver + monthly salary) which is about $400k in total and is funded completely by U.S. taxpayers (my university is a public university, and my research project was funded by U.S. Army). 

If there is no OPT STEM extension available for me, under the current regulation, I have only 12 months of OPT. This is enough for doing the H1B lottery once, which has a ~50% chance of being approved. If I am not lucky enough to get the H1B work visa, I need to leave U.S. immediately after my 12-month OPT.

This means U.S. taxpayers spent $400k on training me and have a ~50% chance of losing me to a foreign country in 12 months. This means my employer, a top high-tech U.S. company has ~50% chance of losing a good employee after 12 months. I think this is a bad deal for U.S.

And I am by no means competing with U.S. citizens for job opportunity. In my industry, there is a significant shortage of advanced degree workers. And there are simply not enough students majoring in this area (let alone enough U.S. citizens).

In the proposed rule, this won't be an issue since an F1 student with advanced degree in STEM will have at least 3 tries for H1B lottery. At ~50% approval rate, 3-4 tries result in only ~10% chance of not getting a H1B visa. This is much better than the current rule.

I sincerely hope this proposed rule can be approved to help boost the U.S. economy. In case you need further information from me, I can be reached via email. Thanks!
