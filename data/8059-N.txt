I am an American STEM graduate; I have a PhD degree in the Life Sciences. I am working in a STEM position at very low wages because I love the work; however, many of my STEM graduate colleagues have given up looking for work in STEM fields because of much increased competition and corresponding wage depression from employers hiring cheap foreign labor. The OPT program was meant to give foreign students the tools to help their own countries when they returned, but it has become a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor at the expense of American STEM workers. This program should not be expanded; abuse and fraud should be eliminated in this program. All immigration-related programs should ALWAYS put Americans workers before foreign workers.
