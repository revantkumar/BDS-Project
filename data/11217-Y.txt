I fully support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. US has a huge number of students working in Science and Technology field and it will greatly help them to have the extended period to develop their skills and help the the tech force in this country. It would be disastrous if this program is removed as a lot of highly qualified workers will be forced to leave the country.
