yun xia I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal my reasons are as follows
1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S..

2. Diversity is veryimportant for the U.S.you cannot deny the contribution that international students had made for this country.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing.It helps U.S. to select the most excellent talentsno matter local people or foreigners. International students are better than some local students they are more delegent and capable. That's why those who actually have no strength feel threatened would disapprove the issue.
