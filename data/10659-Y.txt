But why are you saying "non-citizens ARE TREATED BETTER" ? In fact, there are lots of job opportunities open just to citizens and none open just to non-citizens. Also, citizens would have higher chance to get jobs open to all the people since you don't need to apply for h1b, which would cost companies extra money and energy. 

So, just improve yourself, and do as good as students from STEM project and you would beat them since you are the citizens.
