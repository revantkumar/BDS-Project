As an employee in IT industry, I have seen many foreign colleagues with F-1 VISA. This 24-month OPT propose provide a chance for capable foreign students to work in technology-leading company in US, which in return benefits the technology industry in US. Employee hired through fair procedure should not be support by the proposed rule, otherwise it would be a loss for the employee, the company and the country.
