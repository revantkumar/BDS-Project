I think this proposa is necessary and I strongly SUPPORT the proposal, following are the reasons:

Firstly, international students learn many important and useful knowledge from American university, we can use these knowledge to make a contribution to America;

Secondly, the competition is not exist, the position international students applied always is the position not suitable for local people;

Finally, diversity is a culture of America, it's a necessary factor to America, and just because of it America can develop so fast.
