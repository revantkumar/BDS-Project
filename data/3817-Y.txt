Anonymous I strongly support OPT STEM extension. We strongly believe that the OPT STEM extension opportunity will create more job opportunities for our local people. Many of the international students are seeking for scientists and engineering positions, and they need the opportunity to gain working experience in the US. But mostly they are not going to always stay in these companies. They want to start their own business in the US, and hire local people. No one doubts that the United States is the best place to start your business, and now is the best time, than ever.
