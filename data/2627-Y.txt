I totally agree with the extension. I think it's beneficial to not only international students, but also the United States. The most attractive and competitive sector of US economy is high-tech industry. Companies such as Google, Apple distinguish US from other countries. Actually, international students play important roles in these companies and contribute a lot to the products we are proud of. In addition, what make our country prosperous is the inclusive spirit and open mind. We owned the top universities in the world, which also means the top students in the world. They are the future of US. We should make every efforts to keep these talents in our country.
