Ling Xu I fully agree with this new rule to extend the OPT duration. As we all now it benefits a lot to US, although many US citizen will think this will affect them to find a good job in the market, I don't think so. Imagine those US companies, most are IT companies, if they have enough employees, it will also help companies in other fields and the local cities which those companies are at. If this rule is canceled, US colleges and universities will lose a lot of foreign students, all the services, renting, stores purchases will be affected. As we all know that US has a very good education qualities, the optional training is also important to students where they can apply what they learnt before. US needs foreign students, because only good students are qualified to enter US educational system. Thanks!
