I STRONGLY SUPPORT the OPT extension regulation.

First of all, the regulation gives US more working opportunity. If more highly educated international student will have opportunity to practice what they learn from school in the US, then they need to study in the US, which will increase the US consumption. They need to buy food, go to restaurant, rent apartment, buy car, purchase gasoline, and shopping, which is very good for US economy. Besides, they pay taxes when doing everything, which will also increase the government income. So the OPT extension is good for US labor and economy.

Secondly, the regulation will help highly educated students from all around the world to work for US company longer. Their intelligence is a treasure for the US company, which will help the company be more productive and creative, as a result to be the leader in the world, which will increase US economy and hire more US citizens to work. Besides, if OPT extension helps STEM students practice in US for a little longer and help US company grow, the government will have more tax income.

Thirdly, the OPT extension regulation is good to US education system. It will attract more smart students study in the US for college or higher education since the OPT extension regulation gives them the opportunity to practice what they learn in school after graduation. If more international students study in the US, colleges will have more income since they usually charge international students more. Besides, it will also increase US economy since more people stay in the US and make more consumption.

Overall, the OPT extension is a very good regulation for USA. So I HIGHLY SUPPORT it! Please make the great regulation happen!
