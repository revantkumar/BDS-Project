Sirs:

Giving STEM foreign student workers advantages over American Students in hiring in American Companies is wrong. If two people are equally qualified for a job, one is an American student and one is a foreign student, the foreign student will be given the job because the American Company will not have to pay certain types of taxes (FICA and Medicare taxes) on the employee. The rule is discriminating against American Workers and will harm Social Security in the loss of the estimated $1 billion dollars a year. Social Security is already hurting and is expected to be insolvent within 8 years. The rule is bad for America. The message this Regulation is sending is simply this: Only foreign students are helped by this government and American Students are again harmed by this government.
