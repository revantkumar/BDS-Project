I'm a TA in university of Missouri. From my view, i strongly support the STEM extension. 

1. people should be equal, when one have ability, one should have his own chance for contributing the whole world.
2. People should not judged by his race, color, state. When he has the ability to contribute America and even the world, why do we need to impede them?
3. STEM students cost too much money for gaining knowledge in America and they've already had the knowledge. We need this knowledge to empower our country.

They are not just foreigners, they are fighters! we need to stand with them and fight for their rights!
