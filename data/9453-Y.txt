U.S has the most powerful and competitive free market economy in the world because it gives everyone the same chance to fight for his/her dreams, because it allows the firms and entrepreneurs to choose those who most suitable for their jobs. This is the spirit of U.S, and this is what make the country powerful. I must support the expansion because it encourage competition and make the country better!
