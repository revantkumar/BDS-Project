I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international data science student. 

1. My friends majoring in computer science and I are going to start our new business in LA after we graduate from university. Our project is to build a "smart" website to help foreign people to travel in US. After we put the website online successfully, there will be more people come here to have a trip. At that time, restaurant owners, waiter/waitress, house owners, hotels, theme parks, uber drivers, public transportation system and many other people will gain more money.

2. One year definitely not enough for us to improve our business. Two years or more would be better. After our business being stronger, we will hire more people in US.

3. I'm not going to stay here forever. I love my home country. I just want to help more people in my country to see this world. 

STEM students bring more to US than they take. Please do not cancel the OPT extension.
