Chetan Mehta I fully support this regulation.

As the rules regulatory analysis states, the F-1 OPT students account for only 0.19% of US workforce, which does not directly impact the opportunities for American workforce in any way. The workers on F-1 STEM felids are temporary workers and therefore they leave US within few years after contributing to US economy without taking any benefits of long term US employments.

In addition to help grow technology sector economy, the american universities earn a great deal from international students and an solid temporary work program attracts these international students. No or a short OPT program will make it harder for universities to attract the same volume of international students and hence will impact the education sector economy. The money which these universities earn from international students helps build a good foundation and infrastructure for future generations, both american and international.

In conclusion, this regulation is absolutely required to maintain the world leader status of US in technology and education sectors.
