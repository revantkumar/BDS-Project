I strongly agree OPT extension. 
As we all know one of the main reason that international students are attracted to studying in U.S. is the government provide 12 months OPT after graduating. At the same time, the tuition fee of international students is much higher than American local students. If OPT can be extended, then it will be more attractive to international students to come aboard to study. That means more money will come to US as tuition fee. Those tuition fee is really important for colleges also for the development of US. For example, they can spend more money on scientific research; they can give more local students studying in school as scholarships. In this case, since science is the leading strength of development of US, more international students tuition fee will help the development of this country. In another word, OPT extension will help the scientific development of US also it will help more poor local students to have a chance studying in college with scholarships which will change their whole life!
