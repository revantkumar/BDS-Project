Yong Li As an international student in the USA, having some job experience is very important for us before coming back to our homeland, also my major is organic chemistry which requires many hand work to synthesize lots of small molecules to do some bio-assay and select some potential drug-like molecules to do further studies, so doing this kind of thing, we can accelerate our steps to find effective drugs to tackle very important diseases, such as diabetes, HIV and cancer, etc. in the US. so I hope I can use my skills and knowledge to do some things for the overall health of USA. based on this , I wish u can Improve and Expand Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students.
