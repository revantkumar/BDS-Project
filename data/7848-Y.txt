As a current F-1 Nonimmigrant student, I'm stongly supporting this proposal, which do goods to both the American society and the international students. 

First of all, as the constitution claims, United States shall be pround about its diversity which no other countries can compete with. All men are created equal. Why F-1 noimmigrant students don't have the equal chance to work for American companies. 

I shall also mention the big contribution international students and scholars have made to the current American society. Remember, excellent engineers, statisticians, and scientists from foreign countries have been achieving enourmous accomplishments which support the fast-growing local economy. If OPT extension has been cancalled, then imagine how many talented people would leave the country. It would be a disaster for American society if it happens.

What's more, OPT extension serves as a good motivation for those who haven't planned to study and further work in the states. Attracting more and more excellent students to contribute to the American society is one of the most important reasons why U.S. stands as the top 1 country in the whole world.

All in all, OPT extension would bring out great benefits to both the United States and those excellent international students who are great treasury to this country.
