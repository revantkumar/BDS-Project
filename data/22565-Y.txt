As an international student, who is pursing a Ph.D. in EE, I feel a long-term OPT is necessary for my job seeking. As people knows, when people start their first jobs, they are usually lacking of working experience, with time moving on, their working skills will build up as well. A long-term OPT will ensure first-time job seekers feel confident when they switching jobs. Also it will be a potential benefit for companies, they would feel more secure when they make decisions to hire a fresh job-seekers. Sponsoring H1B costs a lot, hiring people who use OPT will lower their costs significantly. Thus providing a long-term OPT will be a double win for both employees and employers.
