Peter Ginger Improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant students with STEM degree is not only good for nonimmigrant students but also good for American's society.

One important thing that I would like to mention is that the nonimmigrant students will not make the American people loose their jobs. All the companies, which hiring people will focus on the candidates' performance and background rather than their unrelated nationality. Because it's obvious better employees means more benefits. In this case, no mater you are American people or international people, if you did a good job in your area, you can get the opportunities. On the other hand, the market for the STEM degrees related jobs is big. And there are a lot of companies in the US only hire American citizenship. That means most of the time, nonimmigrant students will not compete with American students.

Another very important thing is that thousands of international students come to the US to study. It's easy to think how much money they bring to our country. I think expanding the training opportunities will be more attractive for the students who are thinking which country to study. If American policy is not friendly and attractive, why don't they go to Europe to study with lower price and the same education quality. 

If the OPT is canceled, thousands of people will go back to your country, which means there will be thousands of positions empty. It's impossible for all those companies to find a lot of people to continue their unfinished work in a short time. That will be a big problem. Can you imagine what will happen in the silicon valley? It's terrible.

So I think improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 students is a reasonable and good policy.
