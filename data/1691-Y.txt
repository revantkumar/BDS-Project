I believe that expanding the opt length is benificial for both the economics of the United States and the student. 
1. International labors are cheaper than native workers. They usually work harder and have very good work ethic. It is extremely helpful for the growing of small businesses, which usually have problem affording expensive employee. As an opt student I am working for a small local company and I believe I created value while am paid at a lower rate. 
2. Opt students can help the companies expand their business worldwide and let them know more about foreign countries where they originally come from. For example, a lot of Asian area high excetive officers of hugh global companies started as opt students. The United States is the strongest country in the world because it absorbs all the best people in the world and it is open to the world.
3. Opt students will not have impact on native job markets. Most of the opt students eventually go back to their native country. All they want is working experience in the US. As a opt student, all of my American classmates found decent jobs right after graduation. They don't feel that as an international student, I am competing for opportunies against them.
All in all, I believe that the opt period should be expanded for the reasons stated above.
Thank you.
