Losing the OPT extension will lose a large number of the labor and talent in a lot of organizations. A lot of technology related jobs are dependent on these workers. Millions profit are created by these people in United States. 
While OPT is not one of the immigrant visas released to the international students but a stay pass for them to create values in US. The majors in STEM are supported more by the international students than native American. There is no evidence that support the jobs lost by native are due to the international students. The prohibition is biased based on feelings but not evidence. After all, there is more immigrant from other places that government has to pay, OPT extension is not immigrant guaranteed in any circumstances.
I totally support this rule to create more values for US.
