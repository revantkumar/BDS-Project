I wholeheartedly support the proposal to extend the OPT period from 17 months to 24 months for STEM students. STEM students are shown statistically to be very likely and capable to start companies and create jobs for others. As a Harvard PhD student affiliated with a MIT group, I know that 1 out of 5 MIT engineering students found companies and create employment opportunities for others, and 1 out 4 MIT INTERNATIONAL students found companies and create employment opportunities for others. (Yes international students (at least at MIT) are more likely than domestic students to found companies!) A longer OPT period would help international students stay in the U.S and contribute their crucial knowledge to the society. Making them go away benefits their home countries as you ARE LIKELY driving away the future version of Microsoft and Apple to other countries. U.S is stronger when many talented people from diverse background stay here and foster a liberal democratic society. I can see that the U.S's economy is grow faster than any countries in the world as the talents from other countries all flow to the U.S. Let smart people stay here. Let innovation stay. Create the environment so that they feel the society is welcoming and let them have more freedom and incentives to stay here.
