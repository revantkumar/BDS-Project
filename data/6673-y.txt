Siqi Nie I strongly support proposal. 

As we know, the development of technology makes the US what it is today. Technology companies rely on such students to revive. Letting such students go will definitely be a tremendous for the US government, economy and society. 

It is the advanced system, tolerance of society that attract students from all over the world to US. So why do we give them up so easily? This is a win-win proposal that I see no reason for it to be declined.
