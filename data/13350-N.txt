Current government programs in this area, were originally intended to help business with nominal 'talent shortages'. In practice, it is being used to fire U.S. knowledge workers en-mass and replace them with people who work for third-world wages, driving down U.S. wages and making it necessary for Americans to seek jobs for which they are over-qualified. 

This is government at its worst; exchanging campaign contributions to harm U.S. Citizens and benefit foreign and multinational corporations. Democrats and Republicans have foisted this evil on the American public and political system.

Enough. People are angry enough to storm Washington. Fix this now!
