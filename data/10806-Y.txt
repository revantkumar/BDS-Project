I strongly support the OPT extension ruling. 
I am a new American citizen and also a student studying social science in a public university. The tuition from the international STEM students contribute a lot to the low cost of my university for the instate students like me. Cutting the length of OPT would greatly bring down the number of international students thus hinder keeping the tuition low. Please extend it to attract more international student!
