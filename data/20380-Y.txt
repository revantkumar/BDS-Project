I fully support the new change of increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months instead of 17 months. I believe this increased duration will help students utilize the education they received in the states after spending fortunes on student loans. Students come here by putting their parents' lifetime savings at stake to pave a way for their career and OPT restrictions crush their dreams. They already leave their fate to a computer algorithm in the form of H1B lottery. F1 students have a great potential in adding value to this country's economic growth and making US a world leader in all industries.
