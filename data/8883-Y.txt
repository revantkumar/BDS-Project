I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. International students who are educated in U.S should pay back to American society with those knowledges in ways of working in U.S, paying taxes and help increase economies.

2. People who are excellent deserve to have a position in high-tech industry, only like this will make technology developed. You can see that many CEOs in Silicon Valley are not American citizens.

3. In fact, it is not easy for international students to find job in U.S: a large number of small companies will only consider American citizens, and although some big companies will consider international students, the number of these positions is far less than the number of positions from small companies that can provide to American citizens. So it's impossible that American citizen who has ability cannot find a job.

4. Actually it's not international students grab the job opportunities from American citizens, it's there are few Americans would like to work in those areas, and you can see there are few Americans study CS, EE, etc. Is there any one prevent Americans from studying in these area? 

5. American Sprit is to encourage people who are hard-working and excellent to get opportunities, and those people who are against this new rule obeyed the American Sprit
