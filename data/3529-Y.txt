I don't know what are those disagree people thinking! But as we all in America now, as a land of freedom, which means we are also free to compete fairly disregard of where do we comes from! That's the spirit of this country! Why we can't have an opportunity to work in the US?!
Hope every foreigner can stand up and defend our own rights!
