I strongly support this proposal. It makes no sense for the US university to educate these students and let them go to serve other countries. The US citizens who lost their jobs are not because of the foreign students in STEM field. In fact, the intelligent foreign students are here working hard in the US companies to make more job opportunities which will benefit everyone in this country. Job opportunities are created instead of consumed by these smart foreign students!
