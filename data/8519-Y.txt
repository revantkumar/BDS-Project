In my opinion, the new stem opt extension would greatly benefit the economy of United States as well as the students who have received education in United States. The new 24 months would greatly help STEM students to practice their skills learned from universities. The new policy would also help lots of US tech companies to improve their performance and creativity, which would further create new job opportunities in the United States. 
All in all, I think the new policy would greatly enhance the further process of the US society, provide larger opportunity and promise a good future in the long term.
