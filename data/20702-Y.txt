The beauty of diversity is you get all the different expertise and experience which is otherwise unattainable with purely American citizens and permanent residents.By giving international STEM students a significant extension, US industries will have a chance to pick from a bigger pool of talents. There is no such thing as one nationality being more superior than another. International students should be given close to equal chance ( they will still struggle more than permanent residents as many companies choose not to sponsor ) to work in the US. This is beneficial to both ways. STEM international students can gain hands-on experience in already developed US industries which they can use to improve their country's standards when they go back while the US industries benefit from the expertise international students bring in. I definitely second this rule of expanding opportunities for STEM international students.
