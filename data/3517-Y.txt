Junhee Park It is good to expand OPT period because of two reasons. 
First of all, students with OPT can raise US economics. Students with OPT usually work with high salaries. Since they need many goods including houses and cars, they spend a large amount of money. This makes us markets active and money flow will be faster.
Secondly, this law will make more foreign students come to the U.S. If foreign students think there are limited chances to improve their career in the U.S, they might not want to come to the U.S. This makes the U.S lose potential in all industry, because the genius guys would go to the another country to build better careers. By this, the U.S lose people who would spend a lot of money for studying and settling down in this country. 
Because of two reasons, I think this bill should be passed.
