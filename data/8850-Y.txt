Doris Mabry Do not extend the proposed rule for a longer time period. I think the rule should be reconsidered and perhaps eliminated. Our colleges have huge numbers of foreign students now, eliminating spaces for our own students. And our own students cannot get jobs when they graduate because they are being filled with foreign students. Our own populations are being left unemployed. This is not a good situation!

Sincerely,

Doris Mabry
