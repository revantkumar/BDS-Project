Based on my own experience, OPT policy benefits U.S. cooperation, especially these high tech company. As you know, the core competition in high tech area is competition between talented people. U.S. needs to attract the talents from all over the world to maintain her leading position. The most efferent way to keep these highly educated people from foreign countries is to extend OPT to 24 months.
