The U.S is an immigrant country. I just can't understand why such people emphasis on thier citizen identifies over and over again. Many years ago, thier ancestor accross the ocean to arrive at north america continent and settled down in the U.S. For what? Cause they thought that american are open and inclusive and they can make thier american dream come ture in the U.S. But nowadays, you, born in the U.S, reject this beneficial proposal so that you can compete for more STEM jobs. It's abhorrent and rediculous to restrict their competition rivals to make their own profit that could ruin the country's creativity and vitality. 
Consequently, I hold a firm belief that with a 24 month extension on the OPT , the skilled F-1 STEM eligible nonimmigrant students could have enough motivation to creat thier carrer in the U.S . And this proposal also benifits American citizens, because F-1 students have more time to apply for a higher paied jobs, thus they won't accept low wages easily. At the same time, the employers could not pay American STEM workers less money by hiring non citizens. YOU, OBJECTORS think this proposal harm your profit, on the contrary, it indirectly do you a huge favor.
