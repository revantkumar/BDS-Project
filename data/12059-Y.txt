As a US citizen, I do believe there should be common ground as US should retain talented foreign students while preventing abuse.Therefore I suggest the new OPT rule should be improved by these steps:
1) very clear and high enough prevailing wage requirement for employers to recruit students on OPT
2) set up a black list of companies that abuse OPT and H1b, those in black list will be forever barred from using OPT or H1b program.
