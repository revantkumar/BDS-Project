shuai zhang I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1.A huge amount of international students make contributions to the U.S in the past, now, and I believe in the future.
2.The extension will not do harm the citizen of U.S, for many position are required only citizen, when the citizen worker are not enough to fit the positions, there are opportunities for the OPT students.
3.Receive the talent people from all over the world is the key for America to stand on the top of the world.
