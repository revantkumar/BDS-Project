Hi this is Dheeraj



I would like to submit the following comments in response to the USICE Proposed Rule, Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students, published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2015.

As an international student in the United States, I pursued a STEM degree and graduated in 2014 with a masters degree . The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension.

I strongly feel that The OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained. Here are some reasons to support my comment.
The proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in their educational field. 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience.expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies.

The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities. I appreciate the efforts of DHS to try and extend the STEM OPT.

I urge you to implement this new proposed rule for 24 months OPT STEM extension.

Thank you,
Dheeraj.
