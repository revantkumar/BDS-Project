If you are talking about burden of training and mentoring, just take a look at how much most of the companies charge their clients for each employee on that clients' project. Sometimes it's as large as 66%. Also, the US economy is on an upswing right now. So, I don't think training and development would be a burden-anyways the training most of them provide is 'On The Job'. Hence, the trade off is very much better. I don't understand why people make assumptions without knowing facts and figures. Most of the comments that I see are based on non-factual assumptions and personal fears. I hope people take sufficient facts into consideration before commenting about such a sensitive rule affecting a vast majority of aspirants. I think the current rule proposed by DHS makes complete sense and I wholeheartedly support the suggestions.
