Lucas Lee I strongly support this policy with the following reasons. 
The curriculum and syllabus of the various Universities are fast changing to changing technologies in STEM
The employers will be getting the top notch brains and new energy filled students who can bring benefit to the company by the new developments science and technology and IT ( Ex: BIG DATA in IT, Social Networking, Mobile technology) otherwise relying on obsolete technologies
The new rule proposed will help that it will not affect any US based existing employees as they are covered under the provisions of new rule protects their interests
The Industry and College co-ordination will get improved by the OPT program
STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.
Without practical training the education for 17 months will not prove to be beneficial to the students
Students will leave US, in the middle of their practical training with half-baked experience, if the OPT stem is not for a minimum of 3 years
