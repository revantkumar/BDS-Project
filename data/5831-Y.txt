I strongly support the proposed rule for the following reasons:
Firstly, F1 students are a group of people with intelligence due to their high education level. They can contribute to the companies that they work at so to the economy of the U.S. 
Secondly, Most F1 student are around the ages between 20 to 35 years old. This is the peorid that a person has the most energy and is the most creative. Keeping these students will greatly help improve the creativity of the industrial world.
Thirdly, every body should have equal opportunity to work
Forth, United States is a country made of people from every corner of the world. It is great because the country welcome all brave and smart people from all over the world.
