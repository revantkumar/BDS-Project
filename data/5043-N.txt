This is ridiculous. With millions of Americans unemployed and our college graduates graduating thousands and thousands of dollars in debt you are now proposing to expand the work related visa program. I am just an ordinary citizen working 7 days a week trying to support my family. I am NOT a member of a militia or any fringe group. But the time is come when ordinary citizens have to stand up and take back our country, whether that be by voting out the current group of Congress people and impeaching the president or overthrowing this government. But the silent majority will remain silent no more. I ask that you do the right thing and start representing the American people, not corporations, special Interest groups, and your self. Lest you forget, you were elected by the people, for the people, to represent the people in the greatest country ever founded by men so much wiser than you it is now an embarrassment.
