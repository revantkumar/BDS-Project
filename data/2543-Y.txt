OPT extension is a great idea. United States is the one who is benefited the most from the extension of OPT in STEM areas. 
The fields of STEM are in great need of more external work force because employers simply cannot find enough qualified workers. Technology companies, research institutes, universities, colleges are struggling to hire qualified workers. The current F1 STEM graduates with 29-month OPT moderately alleviate the shortage of workers. Without an OPT extension, we will surely see impaired operation, or even closure in many companies and research institutes due to unable to maintain qualified workforce.
The OPT extension in the STEM area does not diminish the employment opportunities of U.S. citizens. Most U.S. citizens who are intelligent enough dont enter STEM fields, rather they study in medical school, economics and politics so that they can get well-paid jobs in the future. The jobs in the STEM fields are underpaid and require many years of hard work to secure long-term jobs. This is why most graduate schools in STEM offer financial supports to students, because its hard to recruit enough students. Consequently, international workers in STEM are the major workforces in these areas.
Other U.S. citizens get an ordinary education, like high school diploma and associate degree, to get a salary just enough for their living. International students fill the gaps in the STEM fields and contribute to the related industries and research institutes greatly. Their contribution to the US far outweighs the very minor job competition with a few US citizens in these fields.
