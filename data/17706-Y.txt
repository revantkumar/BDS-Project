It is not a long-term strategy to cancel the OPT extension, and of course would hurt the interests of United States. From my perspective, a proper set-up should be as follows:

1) very clear and high enough prevailing wage requirement for employers to recruit students on OPT
2) set up a black list of companies that abuse OPT and H1b, those in black list will be forever barred from using OPT or H1b program.
