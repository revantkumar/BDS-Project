I am against this because OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. It is also mind bogglingly subject to fraud. The 9-11 terrorists got in via this sort of nonsense. I am adamantly against OPT!
