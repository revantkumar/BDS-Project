I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. As it was proposed that there is mentoring and training plan, employers are required to implement formal mentoring and training programs to augment students' academic learning through practical experience and comprehensive understanding of the industry. Our international student can learn a lot from practicing in the real industry. In addition, many projects last more than 2 years. If there is no OPT extension for international students, it would be very hard for them to complete the whole project. I think many employers won't willing to hire any employee that can't stay in US until the project to be completed. Otherwise, they will have to cost much money to hire other people, it's a waste.

2. STEM OPT extension will attract many excellent students to study in US from all over the world.

The competition between US students and those outstanding international students will let all of them keep learning practicing. Thus they would be more competitive than others. On the other hand, US can also benefit from this program. Our international students can contribute our skills to the hi-tech industry after we graduate. This is win-win.

3. Many people who reject this proposal stated that employers would prefer to hire F-1 students on STEM OPT extensions because these students would work for lower wages. If it is a full-time position, the wage is not low but high. The salary of international students is the same with that of US citizens. International students wouldn't like to do that job if the salary is lower than others. Since international students can intern during OPT period, I admitted that the wage of internship is lower than that of a full-time position. But it's an internship. It's reasonable that intern is paid less than full-time. US citizens can also looking for an internship with the sa
