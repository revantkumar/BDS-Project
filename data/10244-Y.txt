I fully support the new rule for the following reasons:

1. The US job market needs STEM professionals, and rule will benefit US allowing those qualified professionals to serve US-based companies, especially in the field of IT, big data, etc.

2. The rule offers more incentives for international students to come and study in the US, knowing that they will gain experience beyond advanced education

3. Without the rule, thousands of workers might be forced to leave US, causing significant loss to the companies which might affect US economy
