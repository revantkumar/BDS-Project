Dear Mr. Johnson:

I write to you regarding the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. I am an international student, Completed my masters in computer science at sacred heart university, connecticut, where 30% of graduate students are international students and a vast majority of those are in the United States on F-1 visas. currently, I am on my 12 month opt and undergoing practical training, so far the learning experience is wonderful, I learned top notch management as well as technical skills in my area of course work. But right now my future is at stake, I planned of putting a start up company in IT sector, here iin USA, after knowing enough ,how stuff works in an IT company during my practical training tenure. There are plenty of international students like me, who are talented, hardworking and passionate, whose life is going to effect if opt extentional rule is not implemented.

So, its a humble request and I strongly strongly strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. Im particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months.

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule and thank you for all of your hard work in keeping America safe and providing educational and training opportunities to F-1 students. 

Best regards,
