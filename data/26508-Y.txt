I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS OPT STEM EXTENSION!

After reviewing some negative comments, I noticed that there is a common misunderstanding held by opponents on why OPT stem extension exists. OPT extension extends the working authorization for workers in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math. These are the fields that US really demands talents while US citizens cannot fill this talents gap. Thanks to the effort of those international workers and students in these fields, US built its leading role in science globally in the past 100 years. So any views on rejecting the OPT stem extension are short-sighted from the perspective of the national benefit.

Let's take a look at our neighborhood Canada. They started to offer a three-year post graduate work permit for all the international students five years ago. If OPT extension doesn't pass, it would harm the attraction of US universities to international students.
