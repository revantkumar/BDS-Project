Of course I strongly support this policy. Please look at the statistics of the percentage of those brilliant engineers in all of those big firms, apple, google, facebook, amazon etc. How much is it??? If US government won't allow the stem extension, do you know how severe effects it will bring??? More than tens thousands of employees have to leave, especially those young talents. If you want to go back to the economic crisis period, you can object this. But I would say, no one wants that, right? US is a country built based immigrants, and the fundamental factors for its success is absorbing more and more talents. Hire the talents not only from US, but from all over the world.
