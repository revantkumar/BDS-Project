Xinyu Yuan I believe this rule have more pros than cons, which make it a reasonable rule to be carried out.
Basically, the major cons native people concern about is that they may lost their jobs. But actually there are only limit position available for international employees, mostly in STEM area. And the reason for this is because these area need international employee, since the U.S. can not afford such a lot Hi Tech companions just by themselves. Every law comes because of needs, that's why only STEM need extension but other major don't. So international employees works not only for their own needs, but also to fulfill America's needs.
Compare to the little cons, OPT extension bring more advantage to the U.S.. The U.S. benefit a lot from foreigners for decades, since the New England era, and continue benefiting from them. There are international scholars working in research center to help inventing the most advanced theory, there are international employees working in silicon valley to develop the most attractive software. Those people make contribution not only to the U.S, but also to the world. I see no reason to refuse people to continue devote their life into STEM areas to benefit others. 
As a conclusion, although some international students come to seek jobs, they are act just as other Americas, they work, they contribute, and they chase their dreams. And those international students offset the insufficient the U.S have in STEM area, make U.S even better.
