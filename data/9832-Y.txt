YES! I DO SUPPORT the opt-extension.
First, international students with stem degrees contributed tremendously to American Society Development. Without their efforts, America will no longer be the country with most advanced technology in a very short time.
Second, these students are well-talented and are extremely needed by American government. Even though USA owns a lot of stem students, their biggest demand is stem talented, most of them are international students. 
In the end, I think expelling international students will only let USA government gain temporarily relief. If these talented people all come back to their own regions, they will bring the most advanced technique back to their country and the creativity of USA will be dried up soon. What's more, if there is no opt-extension, fewer foreign talented people will choose to come to America because they know American people don't like them. NO ONE will go to a place where citizens there hate them. If by that time. some other county, for example, China choose to provide better platform for these talented people, then everyone will know what will happen next!
