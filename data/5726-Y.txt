I fully support the new increased F1 OPT STEM extension of 24 months instead of current 17 months. I truly believe the increase in duration of practical training is essential to students to utilize the education they received in USA. This is also lends to further increase USA's economic, scientific and technological prowess. Loosing highly graduated individuals would be a loss to the nation.
