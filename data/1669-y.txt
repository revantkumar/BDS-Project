Wayne Loui I strongly support the newly proposed OPT extension rule. International students bring more diversity to the culture and the country. Some of the elite students make a great contribution to the development of the science in this country. With this new rule, more and more international students will be attracted to this country to study which will have a good impact on the economy.
