Richard Li Strongly SUPPORT the extension.

1. The number of immigrants will not increase because the number of H1B is limited.
2. STEM students can improve America's economy, let alone these international students' tuition fee.
3. Without extension, America will lose attraction to the whole world. Many talents are willing to go to other countries where they can work for a while and go back to their own country.

Best,
Richard
