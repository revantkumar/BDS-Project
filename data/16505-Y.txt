This is a great idea, allowing the smartest people of the world to work in America will just make it better. 
New ideas, new businesses, more connectivity with the rest of the world, all these factors will be translated at later point in 
more jobs. 
America has been for centuries the land where the dreams become into reality, where you just need motivation and hard work to draw smiles in your kids.
Don't behave like undeveloped countries where corruption, cronyism and other vicious leave the bright people out of the scene.
Allow the best people (doesn't matter the origin and race) to release the best of their talent, and this country will continue as it is. The best country of the world
