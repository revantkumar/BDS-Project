I strongly support the new STEM OPT extension regulation. The rule has a significant impact to the US economy. The STEM graduates would not take the jobs from US citizen, and they are not cheap labors. The employers would not replace the US worker. These points are explained clearly in the new regulation. Let's give an example: one of the founders of a billion dollar company in India was a STEM graduate from USA. There are more examples. The foreign students learn the latest technology from the top rank universities, and apply the skills to the US companies. They do contribute to the innovation that has a huge impact to the US economy. Most of them are coming here to get either a masters or PhD degree. They learn the cutting edge technologies by doing extensive research. Think about the students who are coming with a full scholarship to the top rank universities such as UC Berkley, Stanford, and so on. STEM is not only a degree, it is a thinking process. You need to learn up-to-date technology to compete.
