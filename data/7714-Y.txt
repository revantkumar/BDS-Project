Eddie Wang Becasuse technology in US is the most advanced in the world, so international students like us come to US for further study. Optional Pratical Trainting is a big part of our study, and we make contribution directly to the development of technology of US company while we work here during OPT. If you US limits our OPT time, more students will be forced to leave US without making any contribution for the technological advance here. Then maybe there will be less and less international students willing to take the chance to come to US for further study.
US advocates fairness and justice, and internationl students have to work extra hard to get the same opportunity and consideration as the local students. I don't think forcing us to leave US will do any good for anyone.
