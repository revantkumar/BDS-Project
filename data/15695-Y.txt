Hi United States Government,

I take a great honour and respect state that i am working hard for the country that believes in growth, uplift with equality and humanity. I have appericate for making a rule I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. Im particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months.

Thank You,
