Sam Dowd You must be aware about thousands of dollars international students pore in the US economy every year by paying huge international fees. International students contributed almost US$27 billion to the US economy in 2014, which corresponds to a 12% increase versus 2013 when the total was US$24 billion. These benefits will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally. The additional OPT time will provide STEM graduates with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. If intelligent International students with STEM degrees are allow ed to work more, they would definitely contribute greatly more to the American economics as well as the technology development.
