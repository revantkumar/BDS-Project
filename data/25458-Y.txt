I strongly support this extension for three reasons. First, America has the most open and diverse culture in the world which let it become the strongest global power especially in terms of economy and technology. In order to stay on this position, the most important factor is keeping diversity and keeping on attracting great international graduates. As I know, many excellent graduates have made great contributions on their fields in U.S. Secondly, from company's side, they always want the right people who is in top level no matter he or she is Chinese, Korean or Indian, not a American who is in middle level. Finally, from student's side, due to the long training opportunity, I chose to study abroad in U.S two years ago. If don't have OPT extension in the future, I think more and more students will decide to study in Europe due to the cheaper expense.
