Based on my observations, heres what I consider the new OPT policy is NECESSARY for your country!
First of all, foreign students have been making huge contribution to the USA economy. It is unreasonable to connect the augment of foreign students with the decline of wage level which is caused by the global financial crisis. And after the 2008 GFC many countries are in the great recession except for America, because America is a comprehensive society which allow more foreign students to establish a business so that not only there is more job opportunities provided but also increasing the government tax income.
Further, foreign students basically has nothing to do with the minimum wage and they should not be responsible for the stagnation of software and the Internet industry wage growth. The real reasons are the outsourcing and industry progress to slow down. The cause of the former is that we refuse to retain foreign students and companies tend to find cheaper foreign programmers who has little experience in the USA. The latter is on the account for the decrease of innovation, which is actually the result of foreign students going back home because we have chased away the elites we fostered by ourselves!
Driving away foreign students may bring brief relief, but it will go against the America's long-term strategic interests, especially the common people's vital interests. With the loss of elites in foreign students, jobs will drift to cheaper areas abroad so that the American innovation will dry up. When we look back the development in Internet of China in two years, we could find that almost all the entrepreneurs have experience to study abroad. This shows that the United States is driven out their own innovators and job creators.
