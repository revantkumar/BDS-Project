I strongly SUPPORT this proposal as it can definitely BENEFIT the United States. If the proposal is not to be put in practice, it would cause a huge LOSS for both the U.S. job market and its economy. Since the major reason for most international students to choose to pursue degrees in U.S colleges or universities over other countries such as UK, Australia is that it is a country that embrace diversities and that is generous to provide chances and environment for non-immigrant students to get enough training and working experience. If the major reason disappears, the U.S. will become less competitive to attract international students, which means the following two arguments will NOT hold any more: 

1. International students is not making the U.S. job market worse but instead the catalyst for creating more jobs in different industries. The number of international students coming to the U.S. to study has been increasing crazily over recent years. They are making significant contributions to various businesses such as restaurants, supermarkets, cars, insurance. Once the business is expanding, it will result in more and more job opportunities being created.

2. International students in STEM fields is a huge drive for the U.S economy growth. They pay expensive tuition fees to stimulate advancement of U.S. higher education systems and academic researches. More importantly, international students have to overcome all different difficulties not only limited to mastering technologies, but also languages, cultures. So only a small number of talented international students can survive in competing with American citizens for a position. U.S. economy growth needs these talents to make the country more competitive since science and technology are primary productive forces for a country.
