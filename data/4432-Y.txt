Neeraj Gupta Like Ruchi, I also came to the US as a student and understand the importance of OPT program and how crucial it is to fresh graduates.
I am in full support of such programs and appeal to the US government to keep working for their betterment so that talented graduates like Ruchi and many others could benefit from it.
