I support this decision. Because in today's America, most students with STEM degrees are not domestic students. The majority of them is F-1 students, which is a strong force in America's technology industry. It will both provide high-end labor forces for the U.S. and give the students an opportunity to have work experience in the most famous companies in the world. It's a win-win.
