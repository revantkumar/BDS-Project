As a career coach I work with many American workers who are challenged in finding employment within the technical fields. They are highly qualified for the positions they seek. Encouraging workers from outside the US to compete for these positions only serves to undermine our American workforce. I would open the doors to foreign workers ONLY after we have depleted our domestic technical talent in this area. I understand that the salaries earned by foreign workers is much better than they would receive in their homelands which encourages them to accept lower paying salaries that undercut what American workers should be paid. Please consider this when passing legislation that only hurts and discourages the American workforce.
