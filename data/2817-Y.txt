I STRONGLY SUPPORT the new regulation proposed by DHS which improves the expands the training opportunities for F1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees and cap-gap relief for all eligible F1 students. This is very important for the students themselves but also for the development of united states.

1.Improvement and expansion for the training for F1 students is a good opportunity for international students to get practical training in the field of theirs after their academic training in the united states. Knowledge is not only passed in schools but also in the job market. New grads are a big part for the US job market. Growing companies and economics need these kinds of new blood to bring energy to the development of the country

2.Nowadays, were living in a global environment. Success should rely on multiple sources and labor supplies. United States is famous for its generosity and its multi-cultural environment. Expanding the training opportunities for F1 students will provide United States with a more competitive position in the global environment.

3.United States is a country who respects the human rights for every single human being. If rejecting to expand the training opportunities, that will violate the standing point of united states. 

Thus, I highly support the new regulation for expanding the training opportunities for F1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees and cap-gap relief for all eligible F1 students.
