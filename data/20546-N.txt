Dear Regulations.gov

As an American citizen and taxpayer I wish to strongly protest and ask you to retract the expansion of your irresponsible OPT program!
A Freedom of Information Act request has already revealed that this irresponsible program has already cost American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.
OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.
Companies don't want to hire Americans and they abuse {H-1B} and OPT to hire cheap labor instead of hiring anyone over the age of 35, especially in software or tech areas.
I ask you to respond to my comment and think again about your irresponsible actions in expanding this program.
America is not the private buffet of foreign nationals and global corporations!

thank you
