I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international Biology student from China and was an researcher at Ohio state university. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my degree in US, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and British. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the most advanced industry training during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their science field and I may choose to study in other countries with lower tuition and better policy to foreign STEM students. BTW, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because most of the employees in these company are foreign STEM elites.
