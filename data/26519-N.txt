The Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries.

This proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation.

It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix. Several large American companies such as Microsoft and Disney have replaced American workers with foreign workers at much lower wages. in violation of regulations. This rule would encourage further job loss for American workers and decrease wages.

Additionally many of theF-1 studants would not pay payroll taxes further depleting SSS & medicad funds.

This F-1 program needs to be cancelled completely.
