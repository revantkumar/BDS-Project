I wish to voice my support to this program. 

According to Chinese Department of Education, 75% Chinese student studied in the US graduating in 2014 returned to China after getting the degree. This data in a way shows that foreign students are not staying in the US. One of the reasons for this phenomenon is the immigration limitation. To work in the United States long term a F-1 student had to obtain a H1-B visa, which is under strict annual quota (65,000) and subjects to lottery. With longer OPT period, foreign students will be given more chance to obtain a H1-B visa, thus staying in the US.

Some said that foreign students would take away jobs from Americans. That's not really a case, even if without the proposed no-termination-of-US-workers-for-OPT-students rule. In 2011, there were about 26M STEM jobs in the US (http://www.governing.com/gov-data/stem-jobs-employment-map.html); in 2013, there were about 0.34M foreign student pursuing a STEM degree in the US (https://www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/pdf/by-the-numbers1.pdf). That could roughly translates into less than 0.1M foreign student getting a STEM degree in the US per year. 26M v. 0.1M. This is a 260:1 ratio (should be higher considering that job market was expanding). The influx of foreign student has a impact on job market that is less than 0.5%, which is minimal.

One also need to look at the competition created by foreign students that go back home. They had access to top tier American technologies, resources and connections. And then they go back home, start companies or serve government agancies or enter R&D field, all competing with US interests. If we could help them stay, they can serve our interest rather than competing with.
