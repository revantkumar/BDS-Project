Henry Yang I think OPT extension is a good way to attract more visitors to the USA.

First, it is a big difference if an international choose to study in the US rather than any other country. Because USA is willing to give them a chance to find hands-on working experience. Therefore, increasing number of international students will come to the US. They don't not just come to student, they will go travelling as well. Some of them may go back in summer and winter vacation, others will stay to explore this country. They will book hotel room, air flights, buy destiny land tickets and other entertainments. It is beneficial to USA tourism.

Secondly, parents of international students will come to visit as well. Some may even come twice or more times per year. When they come, the whole familiar will go travelling in this country as well. Now we have more than 50,000 OPT extension students. If their parents come and they will go travelling for a week. The expense will at least be: 100*7*2(two hotel room) +70*7(car rent) +80*7*3(food and drink for three person) +500(tickets) =1400+490+1680+500=4070 for each family.
Therefore, total tourism income should be 4070*50000=203,500,000. I think this amount is important.
