I strongly SUPPORT the proposal of expanding training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students for the following two reasons:
1. It will encourage more international students to apply for the university in USA. University can choose best candidate from all over the word and increase the diversity.
2. For the students who has graduated, they have find the job and during OPT period. Every year H1B only have certain probability to be got, if they can not get H1B they are facing to leave US soon. Companies has spend a lot money on recruitment, and loosing so many qualified employee in short time will be a huge loss for them.
