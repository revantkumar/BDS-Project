I believe the extension of OPT period is a win-win proposal. For the U.S, the mother land of American dream, is revitalizing its manufacturing industry, which means the huge lack of labor is needed just around the corner, the chance may never comes back again, the extension of the OPT period for the foreign students just feed the lack, and they even make it better than we expected while most of them are selected from their own country. For the students from all around the world, they can have better understanding of American dream, even achieve their own American dream. The spirit of the American dream should never been forget and neglected!
