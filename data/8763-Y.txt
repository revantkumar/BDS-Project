I strongly support the new rule of giving 24 months of OPT extension to STEM students. First of all, practical training is very important for students in STEM majors. They can get helpful working experience, which they are not able to acquire from taking classes in school. Secondly, many STEM graduate students received scholarships or assistantships from school, companies, or government. They contributed their talents as a student and accumulated research experience as well. It is very beneficial to the US if they can keep working for US companies, schools or research institutes. While the current H1B lottery policy made it difficult for those students to get a visa, it is very important to give a longer period of OPT time for STEM students. Thus, I would strongly recommend to extend their total OPT time to 36 months or even longer. 
Sincerely,
Jack
