I think extending the OPT for STEM major will greatly benefit the country in science. Students also have a chance to apply the thing they learned into practice before coming back to the home country. US government will benefit in several ways:
1. Create a short term work force for science related job.
2. OPT students will have to contribute tax, which will greatly benefit the country.
3. Attract more students to come to study in US since working after graduate is number one concern for students. This will improve the budget of several schools in the public system.
