I strongly support the proposal. The main three reasons are as follows:

1. The international student learn their knowledge from U.S. universities. It is their time to contribute to U.S.

2. There are many potential high-level talented international students who may make great achievements in the further if they had longer time to stay in U.S.

3. Competition is not a bad thing but a promotion to some extent, as high-level people from both local people and international students can be selected, which in turn improves U.S.'s competitiveness in the world.
