I saw a lot of people were against the rule because they were worried about the F1 students taking way their jobs. I don't think this is the case because STEM degrees are in the fields related to science, technology, engineering, and math. And the truth is that there are more demand of skilled people in this field than the supply. So F1 students will not "steal" jobs from Americans, on the contrary they will help provide services and contribute to the progress of US society.
