I am a international student who works diligently at school. I got generally 3.6 GPA in Computer Engineering in University of Kentucky. I am looking forward to get OPT in US. As a biggest and strongest country in the world, I beleive America has a open mind to all the idea around the world. Many American's ancesters came here within 100 years. It was those first generation of immigrants who built sublime American Dreams in this country. I want to get chance to work here, because this country is a realm of freedom. My major, computer engineering, is an area where creativity is based on the freedom without any political obstacle. Apple, Google and Yahoo are the benefit of the freedom of this country. I believe OPT not only gives a chance to international students to work in US but also provide a easy way for Americans to communicate with the ideas around the world.
