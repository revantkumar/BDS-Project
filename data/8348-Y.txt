I strongly agree with the new rule for OPT extension. There is no doubt that the academic sector is the biggest beneficiary from the OPT. The reason why U.S. can attract more great international student than U.K. is we do have the OPT but they don't. A lot of countries do have similar policy to attract more international student if U.S. doesn't make its speed up, our education may not be as attractive as before any more.
