This is incredibly nonsense. Why is the Government past & present hiding these facts from the people of this country. Our Government is controlled by big businesses. The want to control of our lives. This immigration policy is out of control and should be stopped. I know so many college graduates without jobs or jobs that are paying less than nothing. Our politicians have lost our trust. Sorry to say, I love this country, she has so much potential and it is sad to see what is happening to her.
