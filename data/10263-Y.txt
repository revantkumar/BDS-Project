I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..

2. Diversity is veryi mportant for the US, since many famous people are international students like Zhenning Yang.
3. Competition doesexist, but is not a bad thing. In face, international students help American companies to hire the best employees in the world.
