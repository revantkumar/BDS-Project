JIan Wang I strongly support this rule!

1. In STEM related majors, the proportion of the number of the international students is large. In some majors, most of students are international students, such as computer science, electric engineering, statistics, and so on. The companies and firms have to recruit international students from those majors. For those majors, many companies provided U.S. citizen or permanent residents only jobs for american citizens.

2. In additions, international students have equal opportunity employment. So if an employer hire an international student instead of an american student, that means the employer think that the international student will provide more benefits to the company and vice versa. Many american people think that it is the international students that steal their jobs. But the competition always exists and you need to make your effort to win the competition and get the jobs no matter you are american or international.

3. OPT working students will pay working taxes, social security tax so that boom the local economy. International students can will pay tuition fees to make the Universities better and american students can pay less.

4. STEM major international students are very useful to the companies and american economy. The employers hire those students in order to make the companies better so that the companies can provide more job opportunities for both american students and international students.
