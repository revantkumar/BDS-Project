I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:
1. The reason why America is the most powerful mainly because the most talented people in the world come to US to work and work magic, so it's good for US economy to have talented foreign people work in IT field;
2 American culture value equality so much , if America don't give chance to foreign students to work here, then America is not as equal as expected.
3 This rule will attract more talented students to study here, it's good for US education and economy .
4 Hard-working Americans won't lose their jobs because foreigners work here,because gold will glitter forever, and Americans are not enough to make America a better country, they have to work together with foreigners.
