The comment by Gail Corondoni is invalid.
First, he said that American citizens should be given priority over foreign workers. Actually, American companies WOULD BETTER OFFER JOBS FOR AMERICANS RATHER THAN FOREIGNERS if they are equally competent for the job. It is obvious since people love to have contact with compatriots. So the reason why several individuals are out of work is NOT the competition from foreigners(foreigners are at the inferior position in the job hunting process, with respect to language, culture or habits etc), but other reasons. 

So, the work problem has NOTHING to do with the OPT policy, and it is not proper to blame this proposal.

One more thing, even if the foreigners are more competent than several Americans and thus get jobs, is it proper to evict foreigners ? No, it is the competitive environment that push forward the whole society. And the government should better adopt other policies to improve the working problem rather than destroy the beneficial society circle.
