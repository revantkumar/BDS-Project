I fully support the new policy of increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. The US companies have more opportunities to hire excellent graduate students from different countries and cultures, and the students can use their knowledge learned from universities in US and make significant contributions. This will definitely improve the economy of US also.
