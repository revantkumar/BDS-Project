First of all, I don't see from which regulation or aspect the conclusion was draw that foreign persons are placed OVER US citizens in the job market competition. Hiring of Aliens will only happen when "their actions will not negatively affect the job opportunities, wages or working conditions of workers already residing here by demonstrating there are not enough such workers available and that the proposed wages and working conditions meet regional standards", and for the whole time when an alien is employed, "the employer must also actively attempt to recruit workers already residing in the US to fill the position, including newspaper and radio advertising". Clearly, US citizens are absolutely placed over foreign persons and it is the whole point of foreign labor, fitting into niches that lacking locale talents.

Secondly, I don't see how this is going to put foreign persons over US citizens in the education competition. International students pays way more tuition than US citizens which help locale students getting financial aids (http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/05/education/international-students-pay-top-dollar-at-us-colleges.html?_r=0).

It is true that there are a lot of out of work US Citizens AND Veterans right now, but I don't think F1 students who stayed for practice training are the ones to blame. Again, they are hired only when they employers are not able to find US citizens that fit the position. Foreign students are not in direct competition with out of work US citizens or veterans. Everybody has their own battle to fight in life everyday, but think twice before you blame on someone else.

I would like to hear more about how you had to change your employment focus due to F1 students' after program practice.
