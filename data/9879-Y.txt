Zhiyuan Chen Dear Sir or Madam,

I am a graduate international student studying at University of Nebraska at Omaha. The extension of OPT is really important for us who own an American dream. With the extension, we may have three chances to access to H1B Visa which legalizes us to stay and work here, helping a lot for us to achieve our dreams.

Sincerely,

Zhiyuan Chen
