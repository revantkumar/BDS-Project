Charan Satish I support the proposal rule of extending STEM OPT Extension to 24 months instead of 17 months and the mentioned mentoring and training plan.

This would help USA retain skilled people who receive training in the USA but are forced to leave because of Employment VISA issues. These PhD & Masters students are highly qualified and fill in the quota of skilled positions available in corporations and industries which are otherwise outsourced to other countries because of lack of skilled work force in the USA. This would help the corporations keep jobs here which in turn is good for the economy and creation of employment. The more the companies grow the more employment is created and children are motivated to attain skills through quality education which again helps USA.
