The Department of Homeland Security has overstepped it's boundaries by meddling in the Economic structure of this country.
Congress has been designated the maker of laws, and a department created to respond to paranoia should have no say in the
matters rightfully belonging to the Legislative Branch of Government. Access to 100,000,000 rounds of ammunition a year
doesn't make the Department of Homeland Security a de-facto branch of our government.
