The United States of America is well known for its diversified culture, innovation and elites. It is believed that STEM foreigners contributed significantly to this country on the three aspects I have mentioned. It is ridiculous to say that they steal American citizen's jobs while that they created more opportunities to this country. Encourage your kids to pursue STEM rather than complaining here. Ask your ancestor where they came from and how much they contributed to this country. This is how this country grows till today.
