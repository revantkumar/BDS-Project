OPT and OPT extension provide the chance and time for people from all over the world to create innovations which would only benefit the United State of America. Many breakthrough technologies need time to go through many rounds of improvements to become something truly beneficial to the society. 

OPT and OPT extension don't mean taking jobs away from US citizens. Many citizens who has a degree in STEM category get very good job right after school. But there is a great demand of well trained and talented people in industry and academic; therefore the proposed OPT would provide the opportunity to the talented people.

I truly believe that OPT and OPT extension would bring great benefits to the United State of America and make US an even stronger country in the world.
