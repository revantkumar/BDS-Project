It seems to me that hard working ,proud to be American citizens are coming up last on the totem pole these days. My younger son who worked very hard to obtain an associate degree in computer technology in 2009 has been struggling to become self supportive ever since. He has to deal with ADHD on a daily basis. He would love to finish college but cannot afford to since obtaining even part-time work is so difficult for a citizen in this country. He is told that he is over qualified when he seeks work in retail, restaurant or landscaping type jobs--under qualified if he seeks work in his field of study. So much for being "a privileged white male" in America! He is not alone. Many young men in America who were born here, raised by tax-paying parents , are in the same boat And it's sinking for them! something must be done!!!"An angry Mom!"
