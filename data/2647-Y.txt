Great rule! This rule will ensure that our tech companies are able to fend off the invasion of foreign companies! I don't understand why some people think this will harm American STEM students. Have you ever been to any job fairs in any university? Only a few companies accept foreigners. There are tons of positions waiting American STEM students! But why some companies still need foreigners? Because they can't find enough citizens! If you've been to those job fairs, you'll see almost nobody is gathering around those citizen-only companies. Now you want to kick those foreigners out? This will surely kill the STEM industry in this whole country!
