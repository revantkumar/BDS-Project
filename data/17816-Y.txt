It is a wise decision to make a new rule before the court's deadline. But i am afraid whether in the new rule any provision is made for keeping the legal status and work authorization in the United States automatically extended up to 120 days or until the applicant receives a decision from USCIS , if the USCIS has received the application prior to the current EAD card end date.This provision will benefit lot of international students even though they get their STEM I 20 delayed and any error inI 20 or USCIS needs further information and asks for request for evidence. Extending the period from 17 months to 24 months is also a wise decision .
