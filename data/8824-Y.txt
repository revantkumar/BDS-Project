Improving and expanding OPT for F-1 nonimmigrant students is really good for the future development of the United States. 

First, international students have special views and opinions of globalization. Their special experience of studying abroad gives them the best opportunity to improve the cooperation and relationship among countries. They are excellent people and will bring huge fortune to United States. 

Second, it is known to us all that the United States is a multicultural country. Stopping the expanding of OPT shows the bias to international students. This is bad for the reputation of the United States.

Third, people don't want to improve OPT because they are afraid of losing their jobs. However, if there are not outstanding people compete with them, they will become lazy and inefficiency. OPT just gives enterprises opportunities to choose diligent international students. Lazy workers should change themselves rather than complain about the postponement of OPT.

In conclusion, US government should improve and expand OPT for F-1 nonimmigrant students
