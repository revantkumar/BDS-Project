Anonymous (A.R.) I am opposed to the regulation proposed by Pres. Obama, which will give foreign tech students/workers into the USA for more than job training. We have our own residents who need the jobs. Stop beating up our citizens and make it difficult to gain employment and provide for themselves and their families.

All plans must put our citizens FIRST!!!
