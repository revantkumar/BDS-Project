As a foreign graduated student in STEM, I support new OPT extension rule. Before I came to US, I watched several public speakings of Ms Obama, she described Present Obama this way :' He wants everyone in this country to have that same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we're from, or what we look like, or who we love. And he believes that when you've worked hard, and done well, and walked through that doorway of opportunity, you do not slam it shut behind you. No, you reach back, and you give other folks the same chances that helped you succeed.' I can still remembered how people got excited, stood up and kept applauded. I believed there are still people think the same way, I thank you for your support.

One year ago, one popular movie based on one true story - Unbroken was released. I bought the book and enjoyed reading it. When Louie's brother asked the principal if he could live with allowing Louie to fail, and proposed him to allow Louie to join a sport. I was shocked, he was only 16 but so persuasive. I imagined myself as an US citizen, and be asked a similar question, can I live a life with slamming the doorway of opportunity to other folks, who have worked hard, done well and so eagerly looking for a chance to continue working here. Those folks studied hard and got advanced degree, they will not compete with ordinary workers, and left more ordinary people in this country unemployed. They will use their talent and make contribution to high-tech companies, they will make this countries' work more compatible, thus create more job opportunities. I could not say yes.
