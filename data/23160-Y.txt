I strongly support this regulation. Based on my own experience, I am looking for a job recent months. So I contacted a lot of HRs. Some of the HR mentioned to me that they are looking for someone urgently to fill the position, but few US citizens applied. The whole process of that position from interview to offer takes only less that 2 weeks, but still few US citizens respond. However, she told me that hundreds of international student applied for that job, but the company doesn't give sponsor for visa, so they are not considered. Even the stem is there, international students are much hard to find a job than US citizens, how come the international students have bad influence for US citizens. If there isn't a STEM extention, thousdands more students who have found the job will go back to their country. Is the enough US citizens fill that position, based on the HR's consideration about the recent job market, the answer is no.
