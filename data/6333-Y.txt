I strongly support the expansion of Training Opportunities for F-1 Students.

If we look back to the history of America, one of the major reasons making her the most powerful country is her extraordinary hospitality and continuous attraction to the most talented and hardworking people all over the world. Foreign workers, students and scholars come to the country, study here, make contributions here and finally become part of this great country. There is absolutely no reason to close the door and keep the talented out, even in such a more and more connected world. But stopping the expansion program would greatly reduce the opportunity of foreign students working here and making long-term contributions. Therefore, PLEASE MAKE THE PROGRAM HAPPEN!
