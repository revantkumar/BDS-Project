I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. 
I am firmly convinced that allowing international students to prosper in the U.S. would bring in far more jobs than the number saved by driving them out. Admitted, international students participation in the job market itself would increase competition in the short term. You may find it harder to get into Google or Facebook because there are more talented people in the pool. However, if we reject them simply because of this, we should not educate our children at all every college graduate enters the job market to increase competition. In the long term, competition increases efficiency, accelerates development and benefits us all. Do not let irrational fear of competition ruin our true interest.
