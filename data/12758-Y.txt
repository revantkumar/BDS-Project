I will support this rule, as it really benefits both sides. I receive the higher education here in the US, and i know my home country. Combining both can provide great opportunity for the place i will work for and help them extend business abroad. Also, more diversity and technological improvements will be achieved by the companies, institutions and etc.here in U.S., improving their global competibility. Please pass this rule.
