Yes, I support the new proposal. STEM students that received higher education in the US should reimburse US society. And they have studied in majors that most Americans have no will to learn, which will perfectly fill the vacancy of some technology positions. Also, International students are NOT as described as "cheap labor" or "using US funds". This is the STEM field we're talking about and as long as they're employed the SALARY is ABOVE average salary level in the US.
Stop the discrimination and prejudice, and keep the talented in US.
