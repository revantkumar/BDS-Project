I'm 100% agree with the improving and expanding policy. I have lots of friends who benefit from F1 Stem, which let them work in the company for longer time without being forced to leave the country. Their employer also benefit from this because training a new employee could be expensive and time consuming. On the other hand, expanding stem can greatly relieve the pressure of H1B cap since a lot of people may just want to work for 2 or 3 years or so. With the expended F1 OPT, they prefer not to get involved with H1B lottery.
