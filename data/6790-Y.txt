I strongly support this rule because of following reasons:

1. Equal and Freedom represent the American spirit. Everyone can have a equal chance. And talented students who come to US to study deserves more time to practice their skills after graduation.

2. It's also good for US development in STEM fields. As we can see from the past, many foreign students have made big contribution to US economy and development.
