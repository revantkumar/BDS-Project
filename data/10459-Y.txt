Da Meng I strongly support the Optional Practical Training rule proposal by the Dept of Homeland Security. There will be a incredible huge loss in U.S development if the rule fails. Thousand of foreign workers who contribute a ton to the technology industrial which changes our lives will lose their job, therefore, the entire development of the U.S will definitely slow down for several year and it is hard to be recovered.
