Chloe Metcalfe International Stem students are the cream of the candidates standing in that long queue for legal immigration. Check the history of United States and the contribution of international technical students. International students are also helping to fill skills shortages at a time when the US share of the world's science and engineering graduates is declining. These benefits will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally. If this rule is not passed, foreign STEM grads will take their skills and education to their home countries, costing America the opportunity for job-creating innovation. This new rule will help international STEM graduates to stay in the country for longer time and grow in the technical field and ultimately it will contribute towards the growth of U.S.A.
