As an international student, I believe the extension of OPT will not only benefit the international STEM student, but also the education system of United States. Take my department as an example, the most important funding source is the non-resident tuition from the international students. The non-resident tuition is usually as twice much as those of US resident and they would transform into the scholarship/fellowship exclusively for US resident. Therefore, if the OPT extension is revoked, the number of STEM student will greatly decrease and the income from the non-resident tuition will be badly affected. Then this will inevitably lead to the increase of tuition for U.S students.
