I totally agree on improving and expanding Training opportunities for F-1 students with STEM degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for all eligible F-1 students. Many high-tech companies need hire foreigners to make profits for them and as a result will improve the economy of US. If you do some research on the proportion of foreign students in STEM degrees programs(especially in Master and PhD degrees), you can see that the demand for those companies are far more than the amount of domestic students. Foreign students spend their careers in US and as a result make a big contribution to all US people. I think it's very necessary to expand the time they can work in US so as to bring more benefits to those companies whose business rely a lot on those foreign students.
