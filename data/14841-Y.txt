I am happy and agree with the new rule proposal and would encourage DHS to extend it to 36 months if possible to improve and expand Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and eligible F-1 Students. U.S.A is widely recognized as one of the most ethnically diverse country in the world, I myself am on a OPT right now and I believe every OPT student works hard in every industry & sector and contributes to USA in their own way. They generate USA, and USA also generates them. This is why USA can continue attracting a lot of students from world and remains strong. Unfortunately, there are still a lot of international graduate student who cannot get H1B visa on their first attempt because of the limit number of H1B visa. These people have been trained at at top universities and have at least one year of experience in companies but they will have to go back to their homeland which could have very sparse opportunities and try using what they learned in USA which is really an enormous loss for the individual and USA. If USA can give these people OPT extension, they will have more chances to stay and contribute to the development of USA. So, improving and expanding OPT will lead to a win-win situation. It has everything to gain and nothing to lose for USA.
