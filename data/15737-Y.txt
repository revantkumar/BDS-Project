I highly support this new policy and really hope this could be APPROVED!!!! 

I'm a homeowner in Florida and almost all of my tenants are international students or international graduates at a nearby university as most of the domestic students there live at home and commute. 

Not just me--the community as a whole has benefited from the large population of international students. Actually in some kind we live on those international students since most local students would choose to live in campus or at home here. We welcome them to our homes, our restaurants, and our churches, and I always enjoy talking to this diverse and talented group of young people who, like most of us, believe in this great country and its education.

I'll be glad to see them stay here longer, gain more valuable industrial experience, and make greater contributions to our economy and society. And it definitely would be a big loss for us if the new rule cannot be approved.

I on behalf of my community give my strongest support for the OPT extension!
