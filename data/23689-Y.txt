I have to say it is a good policy, which I strongly agree with it. U.S. is the biggest country that live on the based of advanced technique, and it has already become an important part in American life. Every people has to enjoy, has to live, has to make their lives with technique. The Iphone, the Facebook, the new generation of laptop, my favorite tv series--the game of throne. all need new and advance techs and engineers. I have to say, a large portion of them are foreign engineer. It is their hard work that support the USA as the only one most powerful country on the earth. I see lots of comments that stat foreign works take many jobs from US citizens, and is unfair to the local people. It is completely wrong!. US has 200 years history and thousands of people who come from overseas to this land and contribute their energy to it. 200 years before, it is foreign and immigration bring new things and contribute to this land. 200 years later, there are still foreign engineers who come to this free land to seek their dreams and contributes to this country. Noting is different!They all want to make this land more powerful and stronger. They all want to change the world better! Another thing is that, the one who give the statements that foreign engineers occupy their jobs must be the person who completely have no ability to finish the technique work. Or they will do themselves rather than just complain at home. These foreign engineers has paid the highest tax to the government. These many have been used on education and medical service to help the US people. It is their wisdom and hard work that make this Country run in the right track. Without this, the whole society will be pretty bad.
