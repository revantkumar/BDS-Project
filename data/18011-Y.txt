I fully support this OPT new rule. Let me summarize these negative comments here. Most of them are talking about US citizen unemployment, US citizen priority again and again using the same data with different statement and similar funny stories about how somebody lose his job. They are assuming that all the OPT students are low price labor and unqualified employee. They are putting the anger to outsourcing companies to innocent OPT students. Are themselves qualified to work? Do they really know their own country? Do they really love their own country? If yes, why not believe their government and those high-tech companies that bring their life so many benefits. Why all the things in their mind is endless complain. Today they complain about the foreign students, tomorrow they'll complain about their own citizen.
Everyone is equal and unique. Everyone has the right to comment. Those nonsense negative comments are blindly follow some anti-immigration trend. They are not objective at all. They are using the excuse of American citizens' rights to go against American spirit. 
Thanks DHS for all the things they do to both International students and high-tech companies. Please continue to make a clear distinction between right and wrong.
