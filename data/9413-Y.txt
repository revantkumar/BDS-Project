George Dooley This idea of Obama makes no sense we need American born workers working American jobs that pay into our tax system and support this country. Allowing the passage of an increase of foreign workers to do American jobs is insane. Eliminating foreign workers for a few years makes the most sense. Congress show Americans you have good sense and compassion for this country.
