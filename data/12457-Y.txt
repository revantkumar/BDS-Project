I strongly support this proposed rule because every one is born equally and every one should have the equal opportunities to apply their talents and skills in the actual work.So Foreign students with F-1 visa should have the extended time to find a job in the US after graduation to contribute their knowledge and skills to the industry and the American society.The US will become a stronger and better country if more and more talented foreign students are absorbed to the labor force because the smart mind,sincere and responsible attitude,hard working spirit and perseverant efforts can bring more values to the American society.
