I strongly agree with this issue because of the following reasons: 1. Most high tech industries such as IT companies in USA are filled with foreigners or international students. Extend their OPT can really help Americans' GDP and development because future is the Internet and high tech age. 2. It's good for US education since longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in US.
