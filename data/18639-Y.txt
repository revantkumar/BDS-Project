I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international computer science master student of University of Texas at Dallas from China. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my master degree in US, Canada, Hong Kong and British. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. Besides that, the STEM extension is a great support for those who need time to find their feet on industry and learning some really stuff.So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. BTW, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. Without the foreign STEM talents, it's a huge hurt for the diversity and creativity of those company.
Besides that, For some negative comments about the STEM extension, I really do not think the OPT students will influence US citizens' apply of job,since there are lots of job only open for US citizen.
