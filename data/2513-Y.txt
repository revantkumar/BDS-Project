karthikeyan Alladurgam I strongly support the new opt rule as this is the primarily enhancing the future of united states with loads of talented students to show their unique extravagant skills which are acquired from worlds best universities. 
International students who are pursuing their higher education will be a backbone for economy on the land of opportunities.The new rule will surely open windows for students across the globe to see their dream come true and in return they are investing their amazing skill set to make the country proud in the respective fields.
As we all know united states set a benchmark for all the countries especially in the STEM fields,the new rule will give some extra space to students to expose their lavish skills and set unreachable benchmarks to the entire world.
Its the time to sent a strong message to the globe that land of opportunities will always encourage new talent. 

GOD BLESS AMERICA
