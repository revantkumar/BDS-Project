Meredith Meyer I totally support this OPT extension, my colleague is a fresh STEM Ph.D. graduate and he has been so much help to our company, we're doing a lot of business with the Asian American community and some Chinese companies as well, we really need someone who can understand Asian culture and have strong educational background in the US. This program will great help US companies to grow business here and recruit more people from both US citizens and international students. I strongly believe it's a win-win situation from US industries and potential international talents who want to make big contributions to the US economy.
