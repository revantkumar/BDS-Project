I strongly support the "The Immigration and Customs Enforcement Bureau (ICEB) Proposed Rule: Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students", as it will help the International Students to provide enough time period to gain the Practical training on their relevant field of study from the U.S employer and it will help to improve the U.S economy.

The International Students are coming to USA to pursue higher studies in the prestigious USA universities, as USA provides the platform with state of the art studies and research opportunities for the students to enrich their skills. The proposed rule will definitely help the students to gain and practice in their field of studies and help to come with innovative ideas and quality products.

The knowledge gained from USA universities will help the students to deploy their skills in the US employer's project and make USA's knowledge / skill force to stand superior in the global knowledge / skill force.

Thank you for consideration and time to make this rule to help International Student, US Employer and US economy.

Also, it will be greatly helpful, if the International Students can apply for Immigrant VISA (Permanent Resident) while they are in OPT or OPT Extension.
