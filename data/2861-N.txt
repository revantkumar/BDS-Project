I OPPOSE the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program for F-1 VISA holders. 

As an unemployed STEM graduate and a former STEM employee manager I know of many US citizen STEM graduates who excellent employees but who are now unemployed or forced to work outside of STEM positions. Foreign nationals have taken their jobs. 

Foreign students pledged when they received their F-1 visa to leave the US after completing their degree. They must honor this pledge and obey the law. Allowing ANY F- 1 student to work in the US without first applying for and receiving a proper work VISA is criminal. The Federal Administration needs to promote US citizen employment over foreign national workers.
