Dear who may concern,

I major in Civil Engineering. As we all know, OPT is very important period for many majors like civil engineering. Because Civil Engineering is not only about academic work, actually you will learn only the basics at schools even during Ph. D studies as I did. At schools, we only focus on element-level of structural analysis most of the time. However, the buildings, bridges and other structures are not only elements, such as beams, columns or slabs, but complex combinations of these elements. After school and in the real engineering work, we begin to see the structure as a whole picture and learn to design it from elements, joints to the final stage step by step safely and economically. This is not a short term. Many states only allow civil engineer with four+ years experience to take the PE exam. It means 4 years are a fair amount of time for a graduate engineer move up to a qualified professional engineer.

Some other majors such as computer science on STEM is mainly due to their popularity (the high skilled worker demanding). What they do at school is basically the same as what they do in the industries, especially at master and Ph. D level. As to civil engineering, it is a different situation. It is not only about skilled engineer in-demand. As I said, civil engineering students do need the practical training, because that is a part of the complete study process.

I didn't upload any file as a proof. Please talk to any civil engineering student at school.
