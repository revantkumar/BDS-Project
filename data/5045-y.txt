Alejandra Ayotitla I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM to 24 months because it is important that we allow those students who have demonstrated strong skills and abilities to ha ve an opportunity to grow academically, professionally, and personally. Having bright and talented students is a benefit for all of us.
