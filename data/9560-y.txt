Siyu Wang I truly believe that the proposed rule will be beneficial not only to foreign students but also to U.S citizens. Foreign students are able to develop advanced technology that could be applied in our everyday life. If this rule is approved, it will definitely attract more students to the U.S which boosts the U.S economy by creating more job openings in education field. I do not see any harm it will do to U.S citizens in any form.
