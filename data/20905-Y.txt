This is a great idea to extend the OPT for STEM students in the U.S. It will help a lot for the whole economy, especially the engineering firms. I work for an engineering company, it is a big lack of engineers to help with all the projects. There is not a enough amount of US citizen engineering students to fill all the engineering work. Meanwhile, there are a lot great international engineering students who can work very well. I would strongly agree to keep them working on the engineering jobs instead of lose them just because they do not have enough time for applying their working visa. Again, I strongly believe that it is a great idea to extend the STEM students' OPT time period.
