In every family and nation it is correct to take care first of the children and then if there are any scraps those can be given to the outsiders.The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers. 
According to the founding fathers of this nation your job is to enforce the laws that congress makes so in the most respectful way I know how I would like to ask you to enforce the existing immigration laws. Not enforcing the existing laws of this nation is a crime in the estimation of any honest God fearing Citizen, besides that you are being paid do the president's job that means you are my employee therefore get your act together and do your job and let the other employees do their Jobs.
Respectfully Larry M. Case
