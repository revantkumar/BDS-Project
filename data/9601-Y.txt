As one of the F-1 students, I highly support for improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 students. We choose to come to study in United States because we believe US is a place for equality and fairness,a place where we may obtain high quality education and learn how to apply our knowledge. We deserve a fair chance to gain some in-depth working experiences in our related field.
