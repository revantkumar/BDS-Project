To begin with, I am all for this new rule.

First, the US needs more highly-educated people in the field of math, science and engineering. I don't think it is wise for the US to train all those international Master/PhD students in math, science and engineering and end up losing them to other countries. Currently, tech companies already have a lot of employees which are immigrants or non-immigrants on visas, and a majority of them can only get H1B and stay is because of OPT and OPT extension. Without this extension, it is very difficult to win the H1B lottery, which will discourage a lot of skillful people to come and serve the US.

Second, and this is related to the last bit of the previous point, is that when international students feel it is impossible to get H1B, a portion of them will be discouraged to come and study in the US at all. The US is not only looking at losing skillful people to Europe, Canada, China or wherever, the US is also looking at a decrease in the number of international students in schools. Considering how much economic value each international student brings to the US, I don't think it is wise to lose them.

Having a 24-month extension will essentially give each qualifying graduates 3 chances of participating in the lottery. (And I said qualifying because if they can get job offers from tech companies, I guess it's fair to say that they are skillful people that the US wants to keep.) This longer extension will only attract more highly-educated people.
