I have 3 sons and a daughter. All have graduated or will soon graduate. One is a teacher, one is working and attending night classes, another is in DC working while looking for the very American job you are proposing to give to a non American. I am sure if anyone working in congress, or any other government department was asked to give their chance up for their position to allow an immigrant to have their job this would no longer be an issue. I am a tax paying American citizen and do not, under any condition want to have this proposal put into action and create difficulties for my own American children to reach their goals..
