I worked in tech industry where I'm surrounded with smart software engineers from both states and all other countries. Most of my colleagues from other countries have completed their undergraduate or graduate studies here and used OPT to start their work. Some of them are real genius in this field and contribute invaluable impact to our product. Honestly speaking, our team and company cannot afford losing them just because they cannot get the working visa. As a employee who worked in one of the big tech companies in this country, I believe this extension thing is the right act to enforce and it will be a disaster that losing these talents.
