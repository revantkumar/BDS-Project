I strongly support the decision of expanding the OPT extension to 24 months for STEM students. In the past a few decades, international STEM students, who bring solid technical skills and diversity to the States, have been making great contributions to America economics growth in the field of science and engineering. You can see many international faces working hard , sparking creative ideas and shipping elegant products in many universities, research institute and IT companies. The expansion of the OPT extension period would be a great support to these students. Therefore, I sincerely hope this decision can be approved.
