Warren Feng I strongly support this rule. On one hand, two hundred years ago, America was built by diligent and smart immigrants. Everyone on this land should have same opportunities to realize their American dreams whether or not they are American citizens. Most of F-1 students are excellent students from all around the world, they get away from their families to pursue better lives with very hard work. They have great potential to bring huge benefit for America. On the other hand, if more good policy are made for F-1 students, I think through their talent and diligence, there is great chance that more job opportunities will be created for American instead of taking their job opportunities away. Thus, a virtuous cycle will be created.
