I strongly support the OPT extension proposal for STEM students. Based on our hiring experiences, most(above 90%) of the high qualified candidates are international students. They demonstrated great technical skills (programming, math, etc.) and fantastic creativity. As a small business manager, I cannot emphasis too much on how important these talented young people are to my company. I believe other tech companies share similar experiences. We prefer to hire more US citizens. But look at how many American students enrolled into those STEM programs, less than 10%! If those smart international students cannot work any more, we are left of no choice!

On the other hand, the current H1B program is already a big pain for us. We have lost very good employees because they did not win the lottery! Isn't that crazy? The 2-year program will definitely provide us more assurance to keep the talents, which is crucial to our business. If we don't have the STEM program any more, how can we ever hire a junior employee and train him to do the job? Because mostly likely we will loss him anyway after one year.
