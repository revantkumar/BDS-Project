Foreign students in the STEM fields have made significant contributions to the continuous strong growth of U.S. economy and will still be a major thrust in this regard in the future. This proposal definitely relieves many STEM students who wish to make contributions with their expertise with less worries about their soon-to-be-expired legal presence in the U.S. STEM students are generally with high degrees, representing a high level of well educated people. Their legal presence definitely can make the country better. If this proposal is finally turned down, it will be a loss for the people in this country and also a huge loss for the country we love.
