Han Zhang As far as I know, America should be a place where dreams can come true if you work hard. In the history, American was built by people from all over the world, which made it the most prosperous country. The key factor is that it gathered the talent from people from all over the world together which made it the unique country in the world that benefited from diversity. 

However, we can take a look at what the situation is right now. If we don't have the STEM opt extension, and improve the H1B situation, American will lose the talent source from foreign student, and from all over the world, which stands as a foundation of American prosperity. What I suggested is below:

1. Please stop the racist H1b and H4 contracting companies
like Infosys, Tata CS, Cognizant from overtaking over American
STEM, especially the sensitive IT industry. 

2. Fix the H1b and L1 program that are all but monopolized
by Infosys, TCS, Cognizant and HCL, Deloitte and Accenture.
Foreign students pay premium dollars to get an American education,
and deserve a little payoff, a little American dream. The American public
will also benefit from the best and brightest international talents.

Without Opt, and with H1b being unavailable to American educated 
international students,
American education industry will risk a death spiral because foreign
students and parents will wake up to the scam. 

3. Our town is an university town. Without the foreign students,
we will lose jobs and lose a big part of our local economy.
