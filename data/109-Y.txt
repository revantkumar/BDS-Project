Why so many people oppose this rule? Don't you think it's a good opportunity to let you be in touch with potential world-class experts who are right now students with STEM degrees? I enjoy working with my foreign mates in a team in my company. They are quite smart and hard-working which is quite important for a start-up like us. Without them, we cannot make so fast progress. 
STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS RULE!
