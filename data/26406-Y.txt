The STEM extension is absolutely necessary! I know so many great people with F1 and OPT bit had to quit job simply because they did not get through the lottery. To the US comapny, it's also a big loss because the company has put efforts time and money to train the STEM graduates and expect return in future. So STEM extension is beneficial for both sides.
