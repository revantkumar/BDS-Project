As an international student, I strongly SUPPORT the new rule. I was working in an IT company in the US after I graduated using my OPT. I had to leave the company because I didn't get H1-B visa from the lottery two years in a row and my OPT expired. I had to wrap up my work in the company and my company had to lose a hard working Engineer. I have friends who had the same issue as me. 

I don't think I was using opportunities which should be given to Americans, because all my American classmates could find jobs which were even better than mine since they don't need to worry about sponsorships and work visas. 

In STEM areas, companies need a lot of college new hires every year. There are still a lot of opening position out there from these companies. I'm sure they would prefer hiring Americans if there are such candidates. 

I always think the USA encourage people who have higher degree and more knowledge to work for her and live in this beautiful country. This is how the American dream should be. And I believe this is the reason why US universities and the US are attractive to all the international students.

International students came from thousands miles away, spent their time and money to get their degrees. Now they are working for the USA in different areas to help develop the country more beautiful. There is no reason to kick them back home after they graduate. They deserve more time to practice their skills after graduation.
