I believe the OPT stem extenstion would benefit the people of United states more than harm their interests. Because of the hi-tech industry, American people get to enjoy the latest technical inventions more quickly and at a cheaper price from other countries. However, those companies are now fast growing and cannot get enough people to work there. They need technology workers to do the tedious and difficult technical jobs such as programming which American people do not really enjoy. Those kind of work happens to take years of training and an advanced degree. 

So let's welcome the OPT STEM extension which would enable the United States to continue to enjoy the success of the advanced techniques and on in that way, American people could continue to benefit from hi-tech medical and electronic industries more than people from any other country.
