I strongly support the opt extension.

I am a potential Chinese student who are applying for American graduate universities.I have a dream of becoming a scientist. America has indeed offered a good environment for research and study.In addition, the diversity in America has attracted me for a long term. Therefore, I gave up the good chances in my homeland and begin to apply for American universities this year. And I know many excellent Chinese student who are older than me contribute to the America's technology and science. America Spirit encourage people who are hard-working and excellent to get their own opportunities.That's the American dream.That's what we are fighting for.

China used to be a much more powerful country in Tang Dynasty when it was open and welcome foreigners from all over the world. And in Qing Dynasty we closed the door and lost the chance to keep pace with the trend in the world. We Chinese have learned from history to embrace the competition from outside. Competition will not make you weaker, but it will make you stronger. International students with a job in America are usually excellent students.They do not occupy most common jobs but high-tech jobs.American people should improve themselves from the competition rather than go against the opt extension.
