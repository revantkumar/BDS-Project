Competition doesexit, but it is not a bad thing. In fact, international students who knows about the market of both US and the country where they originally from very well. Thus can help their employers explore international market and get international projects, which can benefit all people in the company and other companies in the same field as well. The company I'm working for just got a $3,000,000+ project from Chineses investors, one of the reason that we can stand out from other competitors is that I help solve communication problems caused by different language and know both Chinese and US ways of doing business. I believe there are thousands of international students like me, who have brought significant benefit to their company, other colleges and even the US market as well.
