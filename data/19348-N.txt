Please do not increase the amount of foreign workers with STEM degrees, even if they are college graduates in the United States. There are millions of out of work American citizens who are tech workers who are not able to find decent paying jobs, it is shameful to admit more foreign students and foreign workers to displace them further. Please encourage companies in the U.S. to hire Americans. The Recession actually felt like the Great Depression to millions of families... just yesterday there was an article on the high rate of suicides over the Recession, and it still continues to this day. Unemployment is one of the highest factors.

Please encourage companies to hire American citizens.

Thank you
