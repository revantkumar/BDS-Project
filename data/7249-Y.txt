I actively support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international graduate student from China and I believe OPT extension is a win-win policy. 

OPT and the extension period was one of the major reasons when I decided to go to U.S. to attend graduate school. I could apply what I have learnt in the school right after graduation and gain enough practical experience in the industry during this period. This will help me prepare a better career. And I believe, this is also the reason that thousands of international students leave their own home, going aboard to seek for higher degree. One year experience is not convincing enough for students whod like to show their achievements here to employees in their homeland, and this will deduce the attraction of U.S. academical industry.

I have been working as a Software Engineer for two years. Based on my experience, 12-months seems not enough for a new graduate to learn and acquire skills and experience. In the company I worked, a new graduate need to spend a few months learning required working knowledge and a few months to get familiar with the project architecture before he could actually begin contribute to the company. And usually a new project may last for more than one year before releasing to public. If the student could only work for 12 month, then it is less worthwhile for the company. Without the extension period, the company would lose a talent and well trained employee.
