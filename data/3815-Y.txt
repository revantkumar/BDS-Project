Thomas Shen I strongly SUPPORT the proposal because I think it will also benifit the US citizens. Because science and engineer are important parts of the society. If students can get the opt extension they can make more comtribution to the society and economic thus generating more potential working oppotunities for the citizens. So I think it is a win-win policy.
