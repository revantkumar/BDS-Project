This should not be allowed to take place as it will endanger the progress of our students lives. Our children also need the opportunity to do well in the tech industry. More programs should be made available for our students to become familiar with and do well in the tech industry. All Americans should be able to progress in any area we feel we might want to work. The tech industry is now that area and we need that opportunity too.
