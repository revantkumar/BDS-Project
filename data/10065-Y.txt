The OPT extension is definitely beneficial to both Americans and F1 students. The foreign students have spent years studying the advanced knowledge in States. They have very practical and depth knowledge and skillset to contribute to the entire American society, especially in science, math and technology. The current foreign workers have shown strong evidence that they can create products and services to contribute the U.S. Therefore, I totally agree the OPT extension
