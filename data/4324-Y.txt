I strongly agree that the proposed improvement and extension of training opportunities for F-1 non-immigrant students with STEM degrees should be approved. The reasons are as following:

First, international students are nowadays the major part of students in most STEM programs. Working in the corresponding areas, either in academia or industry, requires huge amount of time for study and research. Therefore, disapproving the proposed extension may results in a lack of qualified employees in both industry and academia. 

Second, approving the proposed extension will draw more talented international students (who are interested in STEM majors) to U.S. This would be an important factor in maintaining U.S's leadership in science and technology, which is historically caused by the its favorable environment to international talents.

Last but no least, the proposed extension will not take job opportunities away from U.S citizens. Instead, it may create more. A boost in one industry may lead to the development of another. The competition should not be defined exclusively within one single area.
