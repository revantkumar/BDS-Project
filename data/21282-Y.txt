I agree with this bill.I assume that there is no worry about the position of other students who are not the students in STEM subjects.Because the OPT visa can allow the students in STEM subjects working on only some programs about STEM subjects.For example,I am a student in Computer Science,so I must hunting jobs about computer science,no matter how long my OPT visa is.In my opinion,the jobs or programs are almost two years,which means it is necessary to let the bill which wants the time of OPT extends to two years come true.If we have only one year,sometimes we can not finish our program,which is upset for our intention to study at universities in the U.S.
