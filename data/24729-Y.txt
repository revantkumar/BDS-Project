One of the most important reasons leading to US being the most powerful country is diversity. F-1 nonimmigrant students play a critical role in this diversity. Most of the F-1 students (specially with advanced degrees) have solid technology background and are very hard-working. Based on the experience of last few decades, F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM major indeed did a great contribution to America economics growth specially in technology and engineering fields. They brought creative ideas, developed fancy softwares which are popular in the whole world and inspired US companies about how to do business across the entire world. A great example should be the new Google's CEO Sundar Pichai who leaded the team to develop Google Chrome which not only helped Google earns huge amount of profit but also drove a tremendous increase in US tech industry. As we all know, Sundar was one of the F-1 nonimmigrant students about twenty years ago. The F-1 nonimmigrant students cases also applied to Satya Nadella who is the current CEO of microsoft. 

Also, improving and expanding the training opportunities won't cut the jobs availabilities of US citizens significantly but this will stimulate American to improve themselves to become more competitive and increase the profits of companies to open more available positions.

In conclusion, this suggestion will not only give the F-1 students more time to win the H1B lottery but also will increase the revenue of US companies specially in tech and engineering fields significantly. This is essentially great help to US economics growth.
