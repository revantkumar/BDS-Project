I SUPPORT this proposal.

The first reason is that those students develop their ability here in America and we should give them a chance to use their knowledge to contribute to America. Otherwise, American universities are actually developing elites for other countries.

Secondly, those students who get master or phd degree will benefits the country a lot if they work here. And OPT is one of the reasons why they choose to take their graduate education here in America.

Thirdly, even though it may bring competition but it is always competition that brings a society creativity and prosperity. Moreover, the job that STEM students take are often the positions native Americans would not like to take. 

Above all, I strongly SUPPORT the proposal!
