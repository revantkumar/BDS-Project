Ricahrd Cui I support the proposed rule. 
1. It helps the technology and scientific research firms to recruit best talented people into their company. And thus help the u.s. economy. 

2. It helps to attract more and more talented international students to come to the U.S. The proposed rule shows that U.S. is friendly to international students and embraces diversity. If international students see that U.S. welcomes and treat international students well by providing not only educational but also practical training opportunities, they will choose to study in the U.S. over other countries. This helps to attract the best talents in the world to come to the United States. 

3. If the rule was not passed, it can be a disaster for many companies especially technology firms. Many firms hired international students in opt status. Some companies even have 10%, 20% of their total employment from international students. If the rule does not pass, all the company have to fire all these international students and they will not have adequate time to find well qualified candidates to fill these positions. 

Based on the above reasons, I think the rule should definitely be passed.
