I support this proposal strongly. America is a furnace country. If just focus on protecting the some not such competitive workers and do not give chance to the high-educated student, it is a backward step for U.S.! 

After learning in the U.S. we want to contribute to this country. Some research need more than several years and more and more high-tech companies need these students's knowledge and technology to develop. 

Protect local workers by not allowing others more competitive workers to survive is such stupid and short-sighted, it is not America. We need open-minded and develop ourselves with these students ! That is the long term wise sustainable developing method for America !
