I support this proposal.

I enjoy working with brilliant people no matter whether they are citizens or international students. As a citizen, I do hope the unemployment rate could be reduced. However, those citizens who failed in job hunting always blame the international talents or government. They even do not think about their own shortage. If someone has a good GPA and good personality, I don't think he cannot find a job. In contrast, I believe it is more difficult for international students to find a job here because their restricted Visa status.

I have some very good Chinese and Indian friends. They are smart and very hard working. I have to say many Americans are lazy and arrogant. We have to improve ourselves to solve the unemployment problem rather than drive them out. Diversity brings competitions and opportunities. Keep talented people here. Don't let those smart guys go back to their country. Otherwise it will be more dangerous for our country.
