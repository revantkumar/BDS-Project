I think the STEM OPT extension is extremely important for both, the F-1 students with degrees in STEM, as well as their employers. The F-1 student visa and its complementary programs of OPT and CPT have helped make United States the leading nation in higher education and research in STEM fields in the world. This exceptional program is helped garner the brightest minds from across the globe and have put them to use for the wider benefit of the people, employers and the country in general. There is, therefore, a strong reason that this program should continue. The OPT STEM extension is very vital to the success of this program.
