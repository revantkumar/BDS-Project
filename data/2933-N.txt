WHAT ABOUT AMERICANS ?? H1-Bs hurt me .. they hurt my ability to charge my clients what I should .. 
I was able to bill my clients $ 150 an hour 20 years ago, today I'm barely able to get half of that due to foreign labor 
both here on visas and in their own countries .. AMERICANS FIRST .... END the H1-B program, it is not needed 
We have the technical talent right here ...
