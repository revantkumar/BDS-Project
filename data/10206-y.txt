Sam Zhao I strongly agree with this proposal. As an international IT student, I noticed that the following fact: 
1. For international students, they need the working environment of US. Thus they can take what they have learnt into practice and improve themselves.
2. For United States, the country needs more brilliant engineers to qualify itself leading the whole world. Take a look at Silicon Valley, it is those ICs(Indian and Chinese) who have been achieving the most tough tasks.
