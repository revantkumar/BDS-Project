I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reason:

- The competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Most international students are working on the fields which they are good at, and which the american may not would like to do. Thus, those fields cannot hire right employees with no international students. I think one of the core concept of American dreams is to let everybody to do the right thing. For me as an example, I got a strong mathematic and computer science background. I can do a contribution in IT field by working as a software developer. And the fact is the need of employees like me is millions and billions, and obviously you cannot find enough right americans do fill those jobs.
