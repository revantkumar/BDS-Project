I think the new proposal of OPT extension is very necessary and beneficial. As someone who has a financial background, I know there is an increasing trend of hiring international employees for quantitative roles in the financial industry. The proportion of international employees in each firm is becoming bigger and bigger. Those employees who graduated from accredited universities with excellent quantitative background leverage their skills and create enormous amount of value for the firms and the society every year. However, the limited number of H-1B visa forces many of them to leave the U.S. and causes big loss for many firms. The extension of OPT would be very necessary in preventing the cost and giving those employees more opportunities to work legally in the United States. It is really a pity that thousands of trained employees have to leave every year because of the H-1B cap. The new proposal for OPT would efficiently help the firms that require quantitative talents as well as international employees themselves and eventually benefits the economy of the United States.
