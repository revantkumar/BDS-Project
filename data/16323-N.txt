Unfortunately our government is putting every other class of citizen ahead of our own citizens. Our children and grandchildren are graduating from college ( paying out of state tuition in many cases) and struggling to find employment. American workers are training foreign workers with visas to take their places. Enough is enough. When will we put our own citizens first?
