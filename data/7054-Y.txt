"DHS anticipates that the 24-month extension would significantly enhance the academic benefit of a STEM student's OPT experience..."

I strongly agree that the academic benefit of a STEM student's OPT experience will be greatly enhanced with the 24-month extension. Being a STEM student myself, I am currently working as a financial risk analyst at a bank with my OPT. I was hired in February this year. It took around three months for me to get full access to the company's system and get a basic understanding of the workflow in my team. My manager assigned me some simple work after the first three months, and I have been handling those work for around four months. Now, after 9 months working in this industry, I am able to complete many projects with high quality. I am also assigned more challenging work and will often come up with new ideas to add value to my work. However, I realize that there are still so many things that I need to learn.

What I am trying to say here is that, from my observation, the jobs at the banking industry and other industries that have complicated structure and require extensive scientific analysis really require a long learning period. For the first several months, I think most new hires cannot add much value to the company and they are actually paid to learn. Not after a few months or even one year are they fully capable to handle more important work and valuable to the company. From this point of view, I think the extension will be beneficial both to the students and to the companies in the US, because in the second 12 months period, the students are more likely to make greater contributions to the company and add value to their work. On the other hand, if the extension is too short, students tend to leave their work before acquiring full knowledge to it and adding true value to it, and the companies tend to train the new employees for nothing.
