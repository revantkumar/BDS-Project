As a proud citizen of the United States of America, I feel that non-immigrant student with STEM degrees SHOULD have the opportunity to stay in the US. There are about 120 thousand international students who come to the United States every year to study and build value to their education. For that value, they pay tremendous amounts of money into the US economy yearly. If the students do not have assurance that they will have enough time to find a job and become permanent residents to this great country, then they will find another school in another country that will provide them the same resources. The negative result of that on US is less amount of money flowing into the US economy. 

The main reason international students come to US is because of the incredible resources (i.e. research, technology, great education) the universities can provide to the students. However, we have to realize that a lot of the resources exist because of the previously known non-immigrant STEM students, who become faculty and professors in the same university and build value to the same program and pass on their knowledge. Without the best and the brightest people from around the world, US would not be where it is today. 

If the non-immigrant students are allowed to stay in the United States by following a legal process and protocol, they will only build up the nation by adding value to our industries, healthcare teams, schools and universities, and economy. We do not need to be threatened by one another. Instead we need to work together, challenge each other, and prove that we will bring the best efforts to our jobs for the betterment of the country.
