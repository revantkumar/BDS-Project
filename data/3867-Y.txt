Bonita Horger This is like a SPIT IN THE FACE to all tax paying American citizens. Congress stole all the funds in Social Security to put the money into the gen. fund, people now receiving Social Security are getting on 40% of the amount they should have gotten. Social Security has gone without raises many years (congress never fails to vote themselves a raise) now congress has awarded illegals access to SS funds. Congress want to move illegals to the front of the class, leaving LEGALS to pay student loans with job left over from ILLEGALS. Do you wonder why Americans want to vote for a President who has no affliations with current congress members? Do not allow the pres. or congress to play favorites to illegals. Enforce the Constitution! Seal the borders, remember 911!
