I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. As an international Ph.d student in Applied mathematics and statistics, I have been trained for five years in this field and I would like to apply my knowledge and skills to the tech-companies or research institutes in United States after my graduation. 

The 12+24 months OPT enables me to join larger and more complicated projects since these projects usually requires more than one year participation to have a better understanding and deeper thinking. With this extension, we will be more confident and have better chance to fully utilize what we learned in US to contribute, both in academic fields and industry. If this rule is terminated by some reasons, we will be very rush in our research projects and it will definitely set a limitation of our contribution.
