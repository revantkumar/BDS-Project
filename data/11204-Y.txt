I am in favor of Improving and expanding Training opportunities for F1 non immigrant students. I believe people coming from different countries contribute towards US's successful economy. F1 students are really working very hard to get what they deserve. Therefore they too should get a equal opportunity to build up their career at the same time they are also contributing towards US's economy.
