The US is an immigration country by nature. Everyone is an immigrant or a descendant of a former immigrant, except the native Americans. The difference is just that some immigrated earlier and some immigrated later. It makes no sense to oppose a regulation that benefits future immigrants, especially in the fear of new immigrants are against the interests of former immigrants.

It is this immigration nature that helps to build a great multi-cultural country and diversified society. There does not exist even a single place on this planet which is as diversified as the US. Many of the top talents in the US that have made great contributions to the US or to the entire humanity are immigrants.

Speaking of the new STEM regulation, this will definitely help to grow this diversification, and attract future talents to the US.

This regulation is also aligned with the interest of US companies who hire STEM students -- they need more qualified labor, which is not available in the US and STEM students come to help filling this gap. Also, the competition introduced by STEM students will help the entire quality of labor to grow. What's more, this competition does not appear in every industry -- most industries consider American worker first; and even more industries only consider American workers. Only a limited number of companies consider STEM students.

Focusing on the long run, the big picture, this regulation benefits the US society as a whole.
