The proposed rule regarding STEM of OPT extension for 24 months will undoubtedly help the USA economics.
As a F1 STEM graduate who contribute their knowledge and passion for helping the USA to grow and develop SHOULD have an equal opportunity to get employment to exploit our talents, as mentioned in the majority of USA companies career openings (no discrimination for nationality, race, gender, etc.)

I can the most highly support this policy to pass.
