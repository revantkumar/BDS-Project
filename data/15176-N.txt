I read this "With companies like Disney, Qualcomm, Microsoft, and others laying off thousands of highly skilled American workers, there certainly is no need to increase the number of either temporary (H-1B) or permanent (employment-based) foreign workers in STEM fields. At the other end of the economy, only 43 percent of Americans without a high school diploma were actually employed as of the second quarter of 2015. Increasing the number of low-skilled H-2B workers will only put more of those Americans out of work and undercut the meager pay they take home." and I just cannot believe that our government would ACTIVELY work to increase foreign workers at the expense of AMERICANS!!!

SAVE A DOLLAR FOR MAJOR CORPORATIONS AND DESTROY OUR COUNTRY?????
