It's ridiculous to stop hiring F-1 students. I'm a hiring manager in a Texas, my company grows fast and I am always worrying about where to find enough qualified candidates. I have to say, there are not enough US citizens to meet our requirement, if government stop the OPT then high tech companies will soon be affected, which might even make US lose the leading role in high tech.
