Millions of international students graduate from American colleges each year. Many of them who are in the field of STEM share the "American Dream", hoping they could make a living out here for various reasons. Some of them may have been fascinated by American culture since a very young age; some want to work with the most brilliant minds and most advanced technology. The extension of OPT will help them accomplish their dreams, or protect their dreams at the very least. I've seen so many of my friends devastated for not finding a job as the deadline of OPT approaches. If OPT gets extended, all of those international students in STEM field would have a better chance of getting jobs here. 
The companies would be benefited as well. As the need for people in STEM increases rapidly, the campanies would be more likely to recruit the employees they need with the extension of OPT because the newly graduated internationals can stay longer to find companies they want to work for.
