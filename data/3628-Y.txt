tina liu I strongly agree.

1.Foreign students can improve the domestic consumption. They will usually go to travel, shopping,which will cause a lot payment to US.

2.It is benefit to the development of high technology. Actually there are a lot of big company founders who were an OPT student before.They have make a lot contribution to US and the high tech development. They also bring a lot job to US.

3. If OPT can not be extended, I think there will be fewer STEM student to apply US university. This will bring a big problem to universities in US. The tuition of these international students bring them huge amount of income.
