Stem Extension is very Crucial for all international Students. Extending to 36 months will be better than 24 months.The ratio of getting work visa in 2015 is 1:3 for fiscal year 2016 and i am expecting this ratio will shoot up in next year too. Under these circumstances Stem Extension will be an alternative way to international students to stay in America, if they didn't picked in H1B quota . Also they will get extra chance to apply for work visa in the next fiscal year.We came to USA to gain some knowledge.We got Some from Masters degrees but that is just a theoretical knowledge.The actual knowledge what we will gain is through work/internships.So Extending Stem extension will help us in gaining knowledge, improving the chances of getting work visa (under present lottery system for work visas) and also help in boosting the economy of USA by paying the taxes.

The training and mentoring program is not a good idea in my thought. The additional documentation for stem students will become a reason to think for managers before hiring a Stem graduate.

.I hope this rule will be passed since the advantages overweight than the disadvantages.
