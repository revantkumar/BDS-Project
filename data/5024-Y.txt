Akash Reddy Nagavelli Venkat I Strongly support the proposed rule for expanding training opportunities for F-1 students. A student who is coming here to study in good universities should also be given enough time to work here to improve his skills and have a clear idea of work environment.

So please consider the request to expand the training period.
