I really vote for it. This is a great policy to encourage the smartest people in the world to work and stay in the U.S. Though some Americans may complain, most people in the U.S. were immigrants before and many of them came to the U.S. because of the greater opportunities. This openness makes the U.S. this prosper today. We shouldn't lose the best people from other countries simply because of the rigid visa issue.
