The new 24 months rule is a very good proposal because i feel it will give International students more time and more chances to grab the H1B visa. Also its very good for USA as it will ensure more students come to the country to pursue their studies and get atleast 3 years of work experience which will be very good on their resume as USA experience is highly preferred worldwide.
