I support OPT extension because I support legal immigration. Many of these immigrants came here to get a better life. You also have to think about it because America was basically founded by immigrants. So, America are more open to immigrants than anything. We are also have FREEDOM of speech and rights. People come here because they might not have the laws or rules that we have today. The immigrants also known as People wants to come here to be in a safer environment and so they would not be so controlled by anyone. Plus, if they are skilled and can do benefits to our economy, we should welcome them.
