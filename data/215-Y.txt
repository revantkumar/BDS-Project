Sarah Wolfe Please expand and improve training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees and CapGap Relief for ALL eligible F-1 students. Foreign students have often paid an enormous price both financially and emotionally in making an investment into their educations and leaving their homelands. When these students are forced to return home many are re-entering or entering an unstable and even dangerous situation. Many of these students have invested greatly in our American society and culture and have the possibility of finding jobs here where employers benefit from the talents of these highly intelligent and motivated employees. Isn't it time to review the benefit of allowing these now well educated students to become a benefit to our society?
