I strongly support OPT extension rule for the following reasons: firstly, I believe giving everyone same chance is the heart of American spirit. It is inclusiveness and multi-culture that contribute a lot to helping U.S become the most powerful country in the world. OPT extension is definitely a good match with freedom and equality in American spirit. Secondly, foreign workers wont take opportunities from citizens because their hard work makes a lot contributions to the development of industries which in turns creates more job opportunities, in this way, more opportunities are created which is a benefit for citizens. Thirdly, OPT rule is one of the most attractive rule for foreign students to come to the U.S. for education since they can gain experience from intern or full-time jobs during OPT period. If this rule is canceled, it benefits the competitors of the U.S. because they will attract more talented students. And that will be a huge lost to U.S. education and economy.
