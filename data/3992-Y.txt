Kristin Zhang As International students, we spend more money to get a degree . Thus we deserve more time to train ourself in practice. opt is exact the best opportunity for us to apply our knowledge.
Also International students won't take up native work position. First employees will consider giving native offer first since they don't have visa problem. The reason we got job lies in that we could do something native don't want to do. Second there are only about 10 thousand opt one year, while the job offers are 43 times more. So international students won't take up natives opportunity. We deserve a better environment.
Strongly support extension of opt for F1 with stem !
