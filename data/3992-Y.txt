Training opportunities for F-1 students are essential to their long-term career development in the United States, and is therefore crucial to U.S. immigration policy. There is no reason to deprive this opportunity, but only to strengthen(/extend) it. 

A healthy U.S. economy relies on immigration of skilled labor, which plays an important role in maintaining the supply of labor in the market. In particular for industries deeply associated with STEM disciplines, there is a significant shortage of well-educated and highly-skilled labor. It is paramount that F-1 STEM students are provided with ample chance to stay in the U.S.

To keep STEM students staying in the U.S. and contribute their skills, we need to provide a career platform that allows them to make the smooth transition from school to industry, and STEM extension for F-1 students is exactly such platform. F-1 students can use this period of time to start working in the industry and wait until being granted the proper work visa (usually H1). Since H1 lottery rejects many applicants (especially in recent years), an extended training period for STEM F-1 students allows them to apply again and hence leads to better chance to stay in the U.S. Hence extended OPT for STEM degrees is an effective means to achieve U.S. immigration policy. 

It is misleading to argue that the extension would harm U.S. interests in any way. Since there is a shortage of STEM labor in the market, the immigration of these students is not taking any job away from U.S. citizens. This policy can help U.S. better achieve market balance and strengthen its world-wide leading position in high tech industries.
