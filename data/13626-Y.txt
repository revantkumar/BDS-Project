Hey you know what? Here in my university, most of the STEM graduate students are international. Some of you just brutally asks to stop the OPT rule. Then who's gonna study the STEM and work for the industry? There are not enough citizens willing to learn engineering at all. My friends are all interested in financial, arts, law, all such things. Here is the thing. OPT should never be stopped. And I personally support it pretty much.
