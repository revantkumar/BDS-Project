I strongly support that the OPT Be extended for several reasons:
1. United States of America is a nation of immigrants. Protect the right of immigrants especially those who are knowledgeable, capable and those who have been endeavoring to accomplish their dreams.
2. Extending the time that these people can stay in the US benefits the American economy because their purpose of stay is to work in companies that are big backbones of this nation's economy. 
3. They are not a threat to the American people. The job market is recovering. Job opportunities are becoming more available. Those Americans who have been studying either with their student loan or with their salaries for the past few years, they will have a fabulous job, for sure. Because these companies are smart, they don't hire people because they are from another country, they hire because they see the tough soul under their skin, whatever color it is.
