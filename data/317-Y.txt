I strongly this new OPT extension rule. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country.The huge success of today's US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc, is bounded to these help from international talents.

I think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program, in light of the fact that most large research/software development projects would last at least 2 years or more. With such a great policy, international talents could better finish their research and contribute to the high-tech companies in the United States and the overall economics in this country.

Hope more people could support this great policy and it would be eventually approved!
