This expanding OPT rule is great for the economic development of the United States. Students who come to USA for education spend a lot of money on the tuition, living and travelling. These can promote the domestic consumption. Then when the students graduate, they work with lower rates and make a lot of profits for the employers. This expanding OPT rule can give USA employers more time to find to right person to work for them and in the long term promote the economic development.
