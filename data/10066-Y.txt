I, here, suggest the Federal Government of United States, with all my respect, to expand the OPT program for STEM student with F1 Visa due to the following reason:
1. The core issue here is about the developed spirit of education rather than the issue of job. "OPT" is short of "Optional Practical Training" program. The initial objective of this program is giving opportunities of gaining practical exposure after learning knowledge in classes to international students.
As widely known, successful education should combine principle and practice. Such spirit of education is the most excellent development in human history. As people nowadays distorted the education issues by connecting to the job problem, it is the horrible disaster to human beings, especially it happened in the most developed country.
2. Even though it will come to the job problem eventually. I think the natives will actually benefit from the expansion of this program. The most essential factor to improve employment rate is the development of the economic. Well educated international student will absolutely improve the efficient of the society, which will lead to the higher employment rate in fact.
