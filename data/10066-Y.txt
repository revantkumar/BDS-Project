Sarvani Kunapareddy It would be nice if the OPT periods is increased. Because most of the students come here to study and gain experience in their field as there are very less opportunities in their respective companies. Andy they take huge amount of student loans. So it's good to have some time to work at companies so that we can gain experience and payback loan before we go back. I hope you understand.
