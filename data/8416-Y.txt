Dan Stein I see so many comments here from foreign students claiming they chose to study in the U.S. 'BECAUSE' of this OPT rule guaranteeing them access to the U.S. job market. This is no argument for the OPT program. It is an argument for the universities to improve their programs, such that the education being offered is better than the alternative elsewhere. 

What incentive do colleges have to improve their STEM programs, when all they have to do is engage in mass commenting campaigns on this forum.

Immigration and work permits should benefit the U.S. citizens, not colleges or corporations. 

Scrap the OPT altogether.
