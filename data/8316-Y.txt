I have spend 6 years to get the PhD degree in Computer Science from the a university in USA. If the government is going to revoke the OPT and the OPT extension for STEM, it is impossible for me to find a job in USA. In that case, I have to go back to my home country and find a job there, that means after so many years studied in USA, with using the government money and received many scholarships here, I will contribute all of my knowledge and ability to my home country, not USA. Meanwhile, at the current company that I am working for, 70% of the employee are non-USA born citizen. Without our highly educated people working hard here, how can this type high-tech company runs?
