As a recent-graduated, foreign-born and American-educated PhD student, I think rather than forcing us to either re-enroll in graduate schools to retain our student visas or leave the country taking expertise with us, people should think about what this nation really needs. This nation is in lack of STEM students, which is a bad thing for both national economy and security. By allowing us to have 24-month-STEM-OPT is definitely a win-win choice for both parties.
