Victoria Liu i saw a lot of supporters asking for the rights for F1 students, but where is that line?
Today they asked for OPT extension, and once they get it, tomorrow they will ask for increasing the H1b visas quota and then it is more green card quota. 
Again, the question is: where is the line?

We have 85,000 new H1b evey year. You think the supporters care about the US economy when they say "giving us the OPT extension is good for the US economy?"
If they don't get the visa, they will go home and some other STEM students else will replace them. They only thing they care about is whethere the people who get the H1b visa is them(not their juniors who has the same degree but graduate one year later than them)
