I'm a Ph.D. Student in chemistry. In my opinion, when free high level education is given to foreign student, which is paid with the tax money, you will expect several years of service to the country from that person in return. The opt extension to STEM Ph.D.s and masters is a way to make that possible under the current tough environment for foreign workers. 
Without this bill being passed, US is pushing away the educated workers. Maybe it will be less competition for the US citizen on the job market, but it won't be good for the country's future. Why is a great nation scared of healthy competition?
