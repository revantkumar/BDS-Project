Jennifer Zhang SUPPORT THE NEW RULE!!!!!!!
For over 200 years, "the United States has welcomed immigrants and refugees from around the world into our nation, enhancing our diversity, culture, and economy. Today, many individuals contributing to the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields are immigrants or refugees, and research indicates that skilled immigrants make outsized contributions to innovation and entrepreneurship, which helps grow our economy and create jobs for all Americans."

Absolutely, highly skilled international student will contribute a lot to the economy. And the OPT new rule will attract more international students to the US. Rejecting talented international students will be detrimental to the US economy.
