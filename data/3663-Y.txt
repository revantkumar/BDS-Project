This is a very welcoming move. This is a win-win situation for both International STEM graduates and US economy. With the increase in the time period, students not only can gain more practical experience but also can make impact at the work place. With increasing completion at global scale, its very important that US need to attract best talent across the world to keep the edge. 

Though i support this move, i urge the government to make stringent rules to stop the abuse of the F1/OPT program. Many individuals are using this opportunity to enter the country and getting enrolled into sham universities with the sole purpose of getting OPT to work rather than getting serious education. Such students upon getting OPT get the jobs into some sham Indian consulting companies who fake the experience of the candidate and push into industry ( they use a shadow resource from offshore place for day to day task at workplace) . This practice is being very detrimental to the US companies who don't have any option of verifying the status and experience of the candidates. The system is being abused at a massive scale.
