I think one of the biggest reason why America is one of countries with greatest technology innovation is its openness to technical talents despite of their nationality, race, religion belief, etc. Thus I think this policy will be helpful in maintaining America's advances in technology, in the meantime allow students with STEM background to find appropriate jobs so they can make the best use of their talents instead of wasting them. Strongly supportive.
