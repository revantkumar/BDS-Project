For those who keep yelling about their jobs are stolen, why don't you simply admit that you do not have sufficient skills to work in STEM industry at all? You know what, instead of those foreigners stealing jobs from you, the truth is that you yourself will not be able to get that kind a job no matter if there are these proficient foreign employees. If they don't work on the STEM industry, then the positions will just stay vacant and none of you will ever be able to fill that, which will result the whole industry to walk backward. Instead of yelling at those decent international students, I myself strongly support them to work here and push our industry forward.
