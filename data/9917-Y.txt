Siyu Li I strongly support this OPT extension new rule.
I'm a junior in Beijing Normal University, I'm considering study abroad. At first I want to go to US, because of the OPT program US has. But suddenly the OPT extension has been canceled. Right now I'm already considering study in Canada instead of the US. Because in Canada I could have at least two years to stay there and working on my professional field, although in Canada , there's no requirement asking our international students to perform in relative fields. And I have a classmate , him too, would like to choose Canada over US. I think, without the OPT extension program , it is not worth so much to study in US. Because the tuition fee is much higher than in Canada and I cannot accumulate the relevant skill set after graduation, this would hurt my career path back to China ! Without working experience , it's pretty hard to get a great job. Sincerely, I hope this new extension would work! if not, for me I could choose another great university in another country , but what the US government could do about losing the advanced ranking in high-tech field. I think it's not just about losing money but also losing dominant position in international arena not just high-tech field,but Militaryeducation, economy etc.
