John Goodman I strongly SUPPORT this proposed rule! 

The extension of OPT will definitely contribute to the economy of the United States. With the extension, more well educated and high quality students will be able to provide their skills to the industry of the States. In addition, they contribute tax to the government while enjoy the minimum social security. What a great deal for this country!
