As an international PhD student majored in Electrical Engineering, I strongly support the proposal on OPT extension. 
Three years ago, when I received PhD application admission from both US and Singapore, I decided to come to US although Singapore had the higher university ranking and offered me better financial aid. The main reason that I chose US was the better opportunities of gaining experiences in industry through OPT. These experiences are fairly appreciated in my major. 
The OPT without extension is only 12 months, which is not enough in most cases. I have completed several projects in my three years' PhD research work. No project was completed in 12 months. We need couple of months to design it, couple of months to fabricate it and also couple of months to test it. The contribution of our work only shows at the end of this process. Similar things will also happen during the OPT. If the OPT is only 12 months, I may have to leave before a project is done. Please note that this is a significant concern of STEM students.
