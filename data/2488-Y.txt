Well, I am not a STEM student, but my fiance is. From my view, his projects are quite time consuming and need long time to work on. I suppose that in big company projects might take years to accomplish. 17 months are just not very typical cycle for most projects, while 24 months make more sense. It would be more beneficial if the companies can keep their employees while doing projects within cycle. You know that replacing people, looking for new ones and training in the process of projects are time consuming. Thus, we should make the extension 24 months rather than 17 months.
