I really agree with this proposal of Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students.That would make great benefits for the US and cut down on the lost of skilled foreign students.It is really useful for both of us.
