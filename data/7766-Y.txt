Leelakrishna Nukala I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed 24 Months STEM OPT Extension rule.

I love contributing to technological innovation and the American economy. I love the proposed STEM OPT extension rule. I strongly support the proposed 24 months STEM OPT extension rule.

As an International student and STEM graduate, I like to see this rule published and implemented without adversely affecting the thousands of highly skilled and highly motivated students in F-1 status who are contributing to U.S. Innovation, scientific discovery, technology improvements and U.S. economy.
