I support the OPT AND ITS EXTENSION policy. 

Many F1 and STEM students are willing to stay and work in America after graduation. Their staying could promote more consumption and pay more taxes to the government like paying rent, buying real estates and vehicles and shopping, which is a significant advantage for America economy growth. More importantly, they are more concentrating and dedicating in their work than American workers because they have no place to retreat if they lose their jobs. They will be more productive for their companies and as a result, more benefit for America.

I rent an apartment for college students. Most of them are coming from China, South Korea and India. They are very smart. I always talk with them. But since the objecting voice came out, many of them who thought about looking for jobs went back to their countries. They thought that it was hopeless to stay with a lot of daily consumption. But honestly, it is good for us. If government shut down this policy, many students would go back to their countries directly after finishing their programs because they are not given enough time to work for America, which most of them want to. We offer them the best education in the world but we don't keep them to make profit for America and send them back, that is a huge lose indeed.
