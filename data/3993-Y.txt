Don Surprise Who is paying for your education? Probably the so called Government of the U.S.A.! We have way too many foreigners
in our U.S.A. now and most of them is collecting subsidy or WELFARE.
Go back to where you came from!!!!!! You are not wanted here! Where ever you come from has good Universities, but your 
Country will not pay for your education!
