I am an american citizen and I am working with a software company. Almost all the employees in our research team are International students graduated with STEM Degree. This new rule will help them to stay in the country for longer time and grow in the technical field and ultimately it will contribute towards the growth of U.S.A.

That's why I full support this new rule. Please issue this rule before 12th February to avoid great economical damage to this country.
