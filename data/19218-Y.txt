I strongly support the proposal as those foreign students who can apply for STEM OPT Extension are are highly valuable human resources and can benefit our economy in the long term. 

Tech industry in in high demand of smart people, and still we cannot hire enough qualified engineers to fill in the roles. The STEM OPT Extension can greatly benefit the entire tech industry if we can retain those talents.
