I fully support the new change of increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months instead of the current 17 months. I believe this increased duration of practical training is important for students to fully utilize the education they received. 

It doesn't make any sense to make them leave after graduation. We provide a valuable education and make them bright students and let them leave to create business opportunities on other countries? Instead we should keep the talent within the county and give them a chance to create more opportunities within the nation. 

But, this new rule putting more responsibilities on the employer who is gonna hire a OPT student in terms of providing a proof related to training and mentoring etc... Its kind of discouraging the employer to hire a OPT student. I believe, there should be some changes in that aspect. 

Finally, I really appreciate the rule and support it.
