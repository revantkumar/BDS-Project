I strongly advocate the proposed new rule for STEM OPT extension. It would not affect the working opportunities for American citizens. Instead, it would rise more job opportunities for US citizens. I have the following reasons. 
1. The new rule would attract more international students to study in the US, even if they need to pay higher tuitions to get a degree. This would increase the fund dramatically for the educational institutes in the US.
2. For most brilliant international students who are pursuing their master or PhD degree in the US, the funding for their tuitions and stipend is from US schools. We paid for their education, why we would send them out to make contributions to other countries? 
3. I would not worry that the extension would not threat the job market for American people. Because the students are only allowed to find a job in STEM areas at which most American people are not good at. In addition, the intense competition would make sure that only the smartest persons can be kept in the positions. If the students do not have extraordinary competence, they would not be able to find a job in the US. 
4. The brilliant international would make great contributions to this country. Take a look at the famous and prosperous companies in California no matter on computer, mobile, internet or biology, how many international people are working hard there as leadership? They would not develop so fast and create globally pioneering activities without these smart people. So why do we force these elites out of this country and make other countries stronger instead. 
I pledge, if the OPT extension policy for STEM students become invalidated, our country would soon lose the paramount position in the world.
