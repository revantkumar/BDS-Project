I strongly uphold the proposal to extend the OPT for STEM students with F-1 visa. Nowadays it is well known that foreign labor resources have contributed much in the field of STEM in United States. And as the globalization trend keeps going, this phenomenon will not change. The United States has long been a country well known of its technological innovation and it has a constant need for inspirational innovators. The OPT extension proposal can draw more intelligent people to contribute to the development of the United States. 
Also, as a current international undergraduate student in United States, I find this proposal extremely important. Considering that undergraduate also needs to look for internship opportunities during college, the current OPT period is too short.
All in all, this extension can be extremely reciprocal.
