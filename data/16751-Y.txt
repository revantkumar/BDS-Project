I do not agree with the expanding opt proposal.

reason 1: It's not fair to those who begin to study in the US in the future. If STEM students have 24 months opt,it means they have 2 chances to apply for H1B visa.As applicants for H1B increasing and accumulating year after year,the later students begin to study in the US, the worse chances for them to get H1B visa. 
reason 2: It's not fair to residents. For some STEM areas like chemistry or physics, it's pretty hard for a student to find a job in industry. If there are more F1 students to compete them, they have lesser chances to find a job because F1 students are easier to be abused. F1 students are more tolerant to lower salary,overtime working and worse working environment because they want to keep their H1B status. For instance, one of my friends is studying child development in a community college(De Anza college) to wish to get a job in a kindergarten. The problem is that she has a BS degree in biology from UCSD, which is ranked #39 in the nation. She can't find a job even she graduated from a good school. Thus, extension of opt will make the situation worse and not fair to both residents and F1 students.

Extension of OPT may benefit IT industry before. However, it harms residents as well as F1 students. American lost too many jobs during last 15 years. It's getting harder to find a job for some major like biology or physics. Now with the extension of OPT, it will make more residents like my friend to work in an area they don't want. Moreover, it's not easy to find a job in IT industry recently because too many students are studying computer science. If we extend STEM OPT, those residents who are studying computer science will suffer what biology students already suffered--no jobs available when graduate.
