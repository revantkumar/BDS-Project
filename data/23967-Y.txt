I personally I am very much in favor of this proposed regulation. The extended OPT can attract the best talents while controlling the total number of immigrants at the same time. The reason why it can attract the best talent is that a three-year period is ample for the employers to determine the most productive individuals and let go the less productive ones. After the three year period, the best and the brightest of the world will be servicing the people of the United States of America. This regulation, however, will not increase the total number of permanent immigrants to the United States at all, for the simple reason that an OPT extension is only a temporary working authorization that will end in at most 36 months. The fixed annual H1B cap, which directly restrict how many people can obtain H1B visa, and the green card application process are more relevant to how many immigrants can enter the U.S. each year. Even if more international students are working in the U.S. after graduation, there are at most 65,000 people who can obtain the H1B visa and stay in the States for longer term. Hence this regulation will not increase the total number of immigrants in the U.S. in the long run.
