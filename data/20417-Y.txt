United states of America is a metropolitan, cosmopolitan and is marked with a mixture of various cultures historically. And this is the beauty of the country. Engineers all throughout the world are working there to make a living for themselves and as a bi-product of this making the US Dollar stronger. Any MBA class would aim to be divergent and not wanting internationals proves to be otherwise. OPT is very important for anyone to get an idea of the best in class engineering in the world as usa is the premiere hub for the same. Denying an opportunity for an individual to experience this is denying him right of empowerment. 
Regulations should be put in place so that local citizens are not harmed by the presence of internationals, but regulations that are aimed at completely biasing the toss to win the favor towards one side without giving way for the otherwise competitive market would prove counterproductive and disastrous in the years to come by. Let the right to empowerment of Internationals not be denied and a rational decision be made to help them indeed. I vouch for a free and natural competitive environment unbiased based on place of birth and is purely based on talent and hard work.
