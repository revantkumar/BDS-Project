I think this proposed rule is really a good idea!
First, the related tech companies who have STEM F-1 students will be benefited. By hiring international students, they can save a lot on paying salary. And international student employees are always hardworking -- actually they have to work hard, since they have to pay for rental every month, if they lose their jobs, they will become homeless; While local students always have backup choice - they can stay with parents for a short period and find another job without worrying to be homeless.
Second, these international students will be benefited. Take myself as an example, after I graduate, if I can work with just an OPT for -- like two years, I will be more competitive after I go back to my home country. I will have more chance to obtain a job in my home country which pay me much high salary than I work in the US.

Thank you!
