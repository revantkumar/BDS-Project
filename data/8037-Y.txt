I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. Students who have ability to make contributions contributions to the U.S. is beneficial for U.S.
2. Maybe there are competition between citizenship and international students, but is not a bad thing, on the contrary, this can promote the development of economics because all the people are pursuing to be better.
