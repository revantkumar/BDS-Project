I firmly support the NEW STEM policy for international students!! Since we are the people who study the technology and science in US, those fields we study are the basics of constructing the US, while native American cannot fulfil all aspects of this goal. Also, STEM policy means that the international students study the majors which most of the technology cannot be grasp by native Americans, so it totally benefit the whole country of US. More elites mean more competitive, and it makes US more stronger than before!!
