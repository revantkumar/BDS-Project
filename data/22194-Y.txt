I am a Chinese immigrant working in silicon valley for 20 years. This rule definitely needs to pass.

I remember the first time I stand on the land of this country. I have nothing but the passion to create everything by my own hands. I went step by step, working on my phd's degree, finding s research position in industry field, finally graduated from school and starting OPT for practical purpose. Right now I am a US citizen. BUT what I am going to say is: if there is no OPT program, I have to go back to my country. This program is the first dream for international students that they realized in this country and helps them try to live, work here for the rest of their lives. 

If u guys cancel this rule, I would like to say the spirit of American dreams is dead.
