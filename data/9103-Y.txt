There is no doubt that many students in STEM are foreign students. In order to seek higher education, they have done a lot of preparation works, they pay expensive tuition fees and living expenses, from another point of view, if the extension of OPT passes successfully, it will attract more outstanding students to come here, they can not only contribute their talents, the consumption can also increase because of this.

United States is famous for this social inclusion, people of various races and cultures are living here in harmony, this is what all other countries have failed to do, and that is also one of the reasons why the United States is one of the most powerful countries in the world.

There are many opposed comments said it will affect the employment of US citizens, I do not think that is a very far-sighted opinion, competition can stimulate improvement, and all the people can improve themselves together. If only because foreign students are better and stop the way they can contribute themselves, it will hit all industries that involve STEM, the consequence is much worse to imagine.

As for other opposed comments, they said it does not need this long time for international students, and explained how they find their jobs. I think they must do not know the policy for international students. The number of companies that can apply for H1B is small, and a lot of companies only require US citizens. In addition, the application for H1B is once a year and it has a relatively small percentage that you can finally get it. Even if you have found an ideal job and the company has the ability to apply for H1B for you, you still need to pray that you can get it just like lottery. 

So if the extension of OPT can pass, it can also effectively relieve the pressure on application of H1B every year, also it can give international students more time to think if they really want to stay in the US, it is a kind of win-win thing.
