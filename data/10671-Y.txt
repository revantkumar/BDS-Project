There is no reason to stop OPT.

It is obvious that F-1 students paying more average tuitions than citizen student. If the OPT is stopped may be less foreign student come to U.S colleges. As a result the native students have to pay even more to get a current quality education.

I think this ONE reason is strong enough override all opposites. The U.S college students do not want to pay more and do not want get the low quality education.

Spirits that makes U.S. great is not include afraid to compete.
