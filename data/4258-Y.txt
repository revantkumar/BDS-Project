YES, I DO SUPPORT this new OPT-EXTENSION rule.

1. Most international students work in technology area, and many of them are among the best in their fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world. Each year, H1B holders pay more than 27%, and often more than 30% of their salary to the federal, and even more to the federal and the state. This money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people. 

2. If the OPT extension was canceled, large amount of international students working with OPT would have to go back to their home country immediately, which would lead to a huge expense of the US companies who hired them to look for new candidates.That would be a huge lose for the US.

3.The diversity of the society is very important. Only by enriching the diversity can this country absorb the essence of various cultures and maintain diverse public voices. And the exchange of ideas and thoughts is good for the U.S. and eventually good for our human beings. Diversity of cultures can also prevent biased or partial collective opinions and behaviors in this country.
