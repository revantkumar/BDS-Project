I am against this regulation which would allow employers to hire foreign workers INSTEAD of US citizen STEM workers. This plan would short change the social security system by millions of dollars byallowing companies to avoid payroll taxes. In a face to face comparison Microsoft or Disney would save 11k by hiring a foreigner from Pakistan than a kid from Boston who went to MIT. Why is the US govt working so hard to replace our high skilled college educated citizens with foreigners? It is bad enough Obama and Jeh Johnson have allowed illegal immigrants to replace excons, African American men and high school and college kids in the workplace.I wish your agency, and DHs would spend some time helping the thousands of American families victimized by illegal immigrant felons to kill our daughters and sons like the two officers in Sacramento, Katherine Steinhle and Jamiel Shaw in California. This is a bad rule that favors the 1% and their political cronies over US citizens recently graduated with great skills and a student loan.
