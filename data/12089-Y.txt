I absolutely SUPPORT the proposal for the new 24 month-extension of STEM OPT. The reasons are as follows:
1. Students with STEM major have sharp skills that USA need. For example, in computer science department, as you can see, there are so many foreign students than Americans there. If you disapproved this proposal for extension, what should the high-tech companies such as Google, Facebook, Amazon do? Who should they hire since the majority of students in STEM are foreigners?
2. Some people say that foreign students created intense competition for Americans. As we know, USA now is a super-developed country, and it needs more advanced technology. If there's not competition, how come USA still keeps 1st in the world?
3. If this proposal for extension were denied, then it would definitely discouraged foreign students from coming to USA for further education. Then almost every state of USA should allocate more money to public universities, indirectly imposing more tax burden for Americans. Then they would complain the government for taxing to high.
All in one word, we should definitely PASS this proposal in the interests of USA!
