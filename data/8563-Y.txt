Mani Sri Vastav Tadavarty I SUPPORT OPT TO BE EXTENDED: As students from all over the world coming to united states to pursuive education in different streams especially STEM courses was having high demand in us .as this certificate enhances the student ability to start his/her career with good quality of work through out the world.every person will plan his/her career during the course and after the course that what and how he has to do .they will be knowing all the immigration rules work permits education system and design a plan of study what to do for coming 5 years before they start their education and spent lot of money for better education and career .so student needs an practical experience when he was sliding from designated student to skilled worker to fulfill this opt is a bridge to make happens, if students from all over the world coming and studying and going back to their own country with out having any experience then its waste of time and money and simply wasting his/her career .allowing students to work for few years as mentioned in new proposal will helps the nation and students and the economy of the country and employers .please don't play with the careers of thousands of students ..hope you understand the issue and take it out in a positive way.
