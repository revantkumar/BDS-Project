The proposal for 24 extension of OPT is great for our tech companies, and at the same time, for the overall economy. Since these STEM graduates can greatly improve the company performance, and hence promote much more local employment. We can see the advantages of the STEM people in the bellowing ways:

1. The STEM graduates are inseparable parts of the core staff. 
Take our company, a leading medical device company, for example. Our core research and development team has around 33% Mechanical Design Engineers as OPT person. Their design and analysis are the fundamental key to successful products in our company. We rely heavily on these top engineers to come up with competitive products.

2. Besides of the products the OPT people create, we need to build a whole team to support these process. We will hire more marketing, sales, manufacturing workers to further finalize the product line. And those OPT persons are not competing with the local job seekers, they work together with different responsibilities as a whole team. It is obviously seem the positive economic benefits.

In summary, the OPT extension should be prolonged, due to the OPT people's contributions to the tech companies, as well as the consequential advantages for the other matching jobs, in the end, we can have a more blooming economy.
