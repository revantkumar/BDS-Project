Doris Wong I think the OPT extension is a win-win -- it would benefit the economy of the U.S., and also provide valuable opportunities for F-1 students.

The STEM OPT extension is for F-1 students who obtained a STEM degree -- mostly Master's or PhD's -- from a recognized college or university, and they can only take on jobs directly related to their field of study during OPT. These people provide good resources for high tech companies that are in urgent need of talents with advanced skills in STEM.

I don't think STEM OPT extension is driving down the salary level. As most STEM students hold advanced degrees, they earn as high a salary as US employees as prescribed by law. Companies doing STEM are not hiring these people for charity -- they actually spend more to hire international employees, and they only hire them because they NEED more people. 

Taking my major, computer science, as an example, it is clear that the number of American students pursuing graduate degrees falls far behind the number of employees needed in the industry. By looking at the development of leading technology companies such as Google, Facebook, Apple, etc, one can see that how the industry would suffer without the participation of STEM degree earners who come from abroad. An internationalized view also helps the companies to broaden their reach to oversea markets. 

Since most STEM OPT students are earning a high salary, they also make a significant tax contribution -- some of them contribute over $30000 per person per year to federal tax. (Yes, they are not contributing to social security and medicare, but they cannot take the standard tax deduction either, and they cannot take as much benefit as citizens from their tax contribution. )
