I strongly support to improve and expanding training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrante Students with STEM Degrees. 

OPT is necessary for international students to get practical experiences after they completed their degrees in US. Because US has the best education system all over the world, most of the international students who come to US are very excellent students. They are smart and hardworking. After they finished their degrees, most of them would like to have some working experience in industry in USA, so OPT is the only way for them to step into society.

Improving the OPT for international students will definitely increase the economy of USA not only in short term but also in long term. Since STEM majors have important roles in the industry and academic, and most of the international students have M.S or even Ph.D. degrees, hold these people in US and give them chance to work will definitely be help for US government.

In these cases, I would like to support the improvements of OPT.
