The new OPT extension rule will definitely benefit the U.S. academic sectors and economy.

One of the main reason for many talented international students' choice of coming to the U.S. for their education is that the post-graduate training opportunities here are so attractive. With the OPT extension, more international top students will come to the U.S and contribute to the academy. Wei is my previous roommate who is an exchange student from Beijing University and has published numerous papers in well-known journals. He would like to apply for a Ph.D. program and was facing with so many options: UK, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong, etc. Wei finally chose to apply universities here in the U.S. because, according to his words, "I really like the U.S. training opportunities after graduate and I can have a chance to apply my skills to the industry".

In addition, U.S. companies will be gaining from the new OPT extension rule. They all want top international interns to make more profit for them and enhance the their cultural diversity. Everyone knows how important it is for an innovation company to have a multi-cultural working environment in today's globalized world. When I go to supermarkets, malls, and restaurants, I often see international students. They bring tons of business here. If the OPT extension can attract more of them and let them stay longer in the training period, U.S. economy will surely be boosted.
