I strongly SUPPORT the 24 months OPT extension for the following reasons:
1, Having a relatively long OPT period is one of the reasons America has been attracting international students from everywhere to come here for school. As we all know, having these students studying here contribute to local economy in many aspects. If the OPT extension gets cancelled, economy could get effected, many people can lose their jobs.
2, Many people think international students took jobs and opportunities away from Americans, this is WRONG. Actually most international students are doing jobs that Americans can't do or don't want to do. It's not true to say international students brought more competitions for Americans. Even if they did, competition is always a good thing, it makes American economy more competitive as a whole. And as a result this could create more job opportunities for American people.
