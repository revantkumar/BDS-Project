I DO SUPPORT this proposal and I believe both American and international students can benefit a lot from OPT STEM Extension. For example, its can help us boost American economy because those international students will spend a lot of money in their study and daily life. In most case, the rich in other countries have both the willing and ability to pursue their academic success in America. There is no doubt that OPT STEM Extension will appeal more people to study in America and the universities and colleges can make more profits from those international students which can help the universities and colleges develop faster and faster.
