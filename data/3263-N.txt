The proposed OPT program is nothing but a legal way to allow companies a way to hire cheap labor. There are many U. S. citizens seeking a job in the STEM areas. They have invested a lot of money in their educations and should not be denied their opportunity to find work.

This program also costs S.S. billions of dollars each year as these "students" don't pay into it. Nor do they pay into medicare. It is used as a bridge to stay in the U. S.

I strongly urge you to not continue to push for this broken program. It is time for us to take care of our own students and workers.

Sincerely,
Dow Bancroft
