John Wang I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons:

1. The international students with STEM degrees are a strong group of people who is making huge contribution to this nation. Most of them are masters or PhDs or even post-docs in the cutting edge technology fields. Their employment in the US gives them time to make their unique contribution. With this opportunity of expanding the employment time, it would provide more chances for the international STEM students to make a real difference. 

2. For those who consider international STEM students as the ones that take away their working opportunities, please notice that international STEM students are a small group of people comparing to the whole STEM students population in the US. Again, most of the STEM students that we are talking about here are graduate students, who brought to life lots of significant breakthrough of science and technology. 

3. Competition makes improvements. For both international students and native students, if they are not good enough for the job, they will go home. It doesn't matter about how long they work, for 12 month or 36 month. Please understand that the ones who actually can make it through everything and got a job that actually fits them, they earn their position and they are making their contribution while others can't. This is the same for everyone.
