I am very concerned about the proposed expansion of the OPT, ICEB-2015-0002-0011, because it will diminish the prospects of recent American STEM graduates. Americans are having a hard enough time finding good paying jobs now, without giving foreign students/workers an even bigger advantage. Students receiving an education in the US should return to their own country and improve the economy there, not give US employers the incentive to hire "cheaper" labor over US workers. It appears that this OPT expansion is simply an attempt to circumvent limits on H-1B visas and should NOT be adopted.
