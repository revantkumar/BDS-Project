After reading so many negative comments about the extension of OPT for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degree, I really worry about the future of USA. Lots of people did not understand why the united states can become a leader of high-tech all over the world. It is because of tremendous high-tech immigrants who make the important contribution for this country. Where do so many high-tech immigrants come from? The undoubted fact is that they were international F1 students with STEM degrees. High-tech company provides a lot of oppotunities for thse students and let them contribute to projects and products which are the milk and bread for companies. If we can not expand OPT for those F1 international talents and let them stay, after 12 months, most of them will leave. Then, companies will have not enough talents to develop new products and run new projects. As a consequence, USA will lose its leadership in the field of STEM in the near future. This is too terrible! God bless USA! 

Therefore, I suggest that we need better policy to attact those young talents and let them stay. For example, the OPT should be 36 months instead of 12months + a 24-month extension.
