1. Give international students time to find job does not mean american people cannot find a job at all. The decision for a company to give offer to any candidate(American or international) fully depends on what quality the candidate can give to the company. Every company in this world wants the best candidate. Especially in science, technology, engineering and math. If gov restricts opportunities only because of nationality. The country will have no future. The top tech companies in STEM areas will have low quality employees, no innovation, the competition on the equality platform is good for people. 

2. If you do a research in any industry, most companies don't sponsor VISA. The American tech worker will never have a problem with it.
