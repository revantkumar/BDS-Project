I support this OPT extension. Currently I leased my former house to four foreign students. They are graduate students majoring in computer science and chemical engineering. I think the totally three years OPT is very important to them and may attract more foreign students to come here. Besides, my husband do not have a full-time job now and the revenue of rent really helped us with our life. I do not want there is any policy which will impair the amount of foreign students.
