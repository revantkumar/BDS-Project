I'm American. Shame on those who are against OPT extension! OPT extension is such a great plan and 24 monts for STEM is awesome. To be honest, the only thing I regret is it should be extended to longer, not only 24 months.

I work intensively with international graduate, some of them are with STEM degree. They are smart, hardworking and motivate. The hope of the future USA is on them. NOT the lazy guy who cannot find a job but keep bitching the OPT policy. I always consider, if our American can work 10% hard as international graduate, we already find good jobs easily.

Anyway, those negative opinion for OPT CANNOT stand for the majority of American. Please DO approve this OPT extension policy immediately. Don't wait!
