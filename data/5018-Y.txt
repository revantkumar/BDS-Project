Chelsea Guo That's an awesome policy! 
With this policy international student in STEM major can stay longer in US, and have more possibility to get work visa. Since local candidates can't always meet the STEM related companies job requirement and quantity, this policy could help them get sufficient talent employees, and create more jobs for local people(think about Uber). 
What's more, nowadays many international students have great ideas and want to run start-ups themselves. But they are always stopped by only 1 year of OPT and concern of visa sponsorship. Now they have more time to try their ideas and manage business to qualify the H-1B visa requirement for self-employed. 
Overall, this policy could help US companies to get more talent employees, and may lead to more new companies and more jobs, which benefit local people.
