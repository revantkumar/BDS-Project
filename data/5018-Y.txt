This proposed rule brings the faith of every foreign student studying in the states on the value they get with education. I highly support this rule for following reasons:

1) Allows foreign students to contribute well in their field of study.
2) Enables them to dream for achieving the American Dream.
3) Benefits the United States by bringing diversity and better talent to further innovation in STEM field.
4) Benefits the universities bring more out-of-state tuition fees that can support local students and scholarships

STEM extension has been a main reason for skilled international students come to the states and study so that they can work for a longer period of time establishing a great start to their career. Hence I TOTALLY SUPPORT this rule.
