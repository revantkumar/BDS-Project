Michael Zhang I support STEM OPT extension. It's shame to see so many mean comments against the program. 
America is a country built by immigrants, and America is strong not only because it has lots of great engineers and scientists but also because it invites the best of foreign peer to join this force and contribute to this country.
STEM is in great demand at everywhere in the world, and USA has many good programs in those field. The STEM OPT program is a chance for the states to make sure most of the talents who grew in these education programs can actually contribute their knowledge to this country. It's unwise for US to send all the best young scientists and engineers right back to China and India after American universities have put so many effort in training the elite students from all over the world, especially for STEM specialists.
As for the comments against STEM OPT, a common claim is that OPT workers are getting American jobs because they are cheaper. That is not true. STEM OPT program exists because the students at these training programs are competitive and knowledgable, and they are equipped with skills that are in high demand which can actually be great contribution in US industry.
