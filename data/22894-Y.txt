I am a STEM major student, a developer and a designer. I have been learning advanced knowledge here and helping companies. The high technology companies lack of people like me. 

If the people like me left, some technology companies have to slow down their development for the business and helping society, and would wait for years to get people to study and practice my expertise and skills. 

On the other hand, I have to go back a place that even does not have my position. My skill will be wasted. I paid a lot of tuition for two years master degree will mean nothing to mean and the companies who need me.

The H1B lottery is already forced many people leave with regret, please let us serve, let us do something changing the world through this great country!
