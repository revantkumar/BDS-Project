Shalini M. I strongly support this rule of 24 months STEM OPT because it helps students to benefit from gaining knowledge and also allows employers to employ foreign students as they can stay for a long time with them. As US is very well advanced in Information Technology and Computer Sciences than any other country known students have a better opportunity to improve their skills and also contribute to the ever growing field of IT which helps US to be on top always by giving opportunities to the students who study in the best schools in the world.
