A good one. I really like it.
It's going to give these international students more opportunities to prove whether they are valuable to this country and give the employers more time to evaluate them. Right now, most companies have to file H1B for these international students really fast (only based on couple months performance) to let them work for the institutions. With this rule, employers can decide whether they want to file H1B for certain employee based on longer time performance which is a much better scenario for the companies and for US.
