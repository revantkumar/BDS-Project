Holly Hall STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy. Many jobs are going unfilled simply for lack of people with the right skill sets. Raytheon Chairman and CEO William Swanson said at a Massachusetts' STEM Summit last fall, "Too many students and adults are training for jobs in which labor surpluses exist and demand is low, while high-demand jobs, particularly those in STEM fields, go unfilled.". Improving and expanding the training opportunities won't cut the jobs availabilities of US citizens significantly but this will stimulate American to improve themselves to become more competitive and increase the profits of companies to open more available positions. If intelligent International students with STEM degrees are allow ed to work more, they would definitely contribute greatly more to the American economics as well as the technology development.
