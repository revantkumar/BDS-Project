I strongly SUPPORT the proposal based on the following reasons:

1. The U.S. is a immigration country that attracts people from all over the world who are able to make contributions to this nation. International students, especially those graduating from graduate program, are people with such abilities. The U.S. government should therefore encourage them to keep making contributions to the U.S..

2.Competition is not a bad thing, although it does exist. Take an example, the Greece government is facing bankruptcy mostly because Greek people enjoy so much welfare, but without making corresponding contributions to the nation. They do not need to worry about losing their positions. Besides, Most international students take the positions either that Americans are willing to do, or they are not capable of.

3. International students are not likely to take those positions with the minimum payment. They are well-educated, which would improve the reputation of America based on the fact many people enrolled as international students before they are making their contributions in different fields, such as academic, business, technology, etc.
