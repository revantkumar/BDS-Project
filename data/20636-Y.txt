I don't understand why there are so many people opposing the OPT extension.
If they live, work, or study in a US campus now, especially the top notch ones, they will find out that the STEM departments, especially the graduate engineering departments, are full of foreign students. 
Admit it, not that many US citizens are willing to take trouble to go for graduate STEM programs, and the US need foreign STEM students to join the US industry.
