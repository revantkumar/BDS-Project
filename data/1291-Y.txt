I strongly support the OPT extension.

First of all, OPT extension is a very important reason that international students choose US for further education. This can improve the income of schools, local business and tourism. Without OPT extension, schools might lose many students and need to increase fees to keep income then it might further decrease the student number.

Secondly, the job market of STEM is with high bar and high income. So the OPT extension doesn't steal jobs from local american. OPT holders are competing locals equally during the hiring process, if there are enough local employers adequate for the job, then the companies would not trouble themselves to help international workers apply for OPT. Since the demand of STEM business is really high in US and they are leading US economy in these days, the development of those companies and US economy might be serious harmed.

Finally, US is a country that respect talents. OPT extension is a good way to maintain them in US rather than lose them. The whole country need endless talent and creative people to keep the development.
