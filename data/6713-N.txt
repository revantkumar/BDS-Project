I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This program creates an incentive for companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.
