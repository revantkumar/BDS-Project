WOW! Another government agency has found a way to throw American workers under the bus! You people do realize that you are employed by the United States government and not another group of countries around the world? Our entire government spends most of it's time trying to find a way to make sure the US citizen is out of a job and begging for help while the scum congress call them bums and takers. I don't understand why a government that needs tax money finds it so hard to understand that you can't pay for worldwide war if your people are too poor to pay taxes. I know the fines for not having insurance means you get to keep the tax refunds but it would be so much better if they paid taxes on the money they used to make before their jobs went out of the country or went to the foreign workers you seem to prefer. Really getting tired of our government working to ruin us!
