I personally believe Science and technology is the ultimate impetus for the prosperity of any society, including the states. Recent technology improvements, epitomized in semiconductor industry, has enabled revolution in lighting (LED), without which smart phones/tablets would still weigh like a brick. Other great new things, like electric Tesla, composite material based Airbus 380, efficiency booster Data Mining and the endless list, are all enabled by the great scientific breakthrough and technological innovations.

International STEM students/scholars, just like other communities, are making a great contribution to the technology advancement, which will benifit the entire human world, no matter which continent you are on. We just want to do better science, develop better technologies in the best environment. USA, please open your arms to the STEM students and be ready for more innovations and a better life quality for everybody.
