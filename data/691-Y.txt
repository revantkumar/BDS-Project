The OPT extension is greatly beneficial to both American employers and U.S. Economy. If the OPT is only 12month, the employees may be left after just gettting used to the working environmental and creating profit to the company, that would be a big lost for the company and economy. Another thing is that as far as I know at my university, few American students would devote four or five years to work on the Ph.D. program. However, Ph.D. in the STEM areas will create more innovation and improve the U.S Economy and more jobs for other people, and the OPT extension would grantee Ph.D. student focus on the research, rather than intern, during Ph.D. program. I highly agree with the extension of OPT to 24 months.
