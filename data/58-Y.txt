USA has always been a country filled with opportunities ever since the day when it was born. Thousands of students whose hometown is across the oceans come to the US, for a better education, for a better prospect, and more importantly, for a better future, which surely includes a more equal environment for competition. But so many cannot get a place to stand in the US society not because their abilities are not qualified, but because their nationalities and pure luck.
We are foreign students, but we received our education and poured our brainpower in the United States. We spent our Twenties - our golden time in the life - in this country and many of us even made contributions to its education. Finally we brought ourselves into part of it. We deserve a better chance for our future. US deserves a better chance for its future.
