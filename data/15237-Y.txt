What a very sad state of affairs when the United States government comes up with and expands programs for foreign
F-1 Nonimmigrant students to come to this country for training and then lets them stay and this action takes away any possible
chance for a United States student to be trained for the same job that they are not going to get. If I am not mistaken the same is
true with H 1 B visas where foreign immigrants are allowed into the country and are replacing working citizens. When is this
country and government going to help their own first....................?????????????????
