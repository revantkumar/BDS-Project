Helen Wang I agree this rule, since a lot of research projects/product development life cycle could last 2 or 3 years, this rule would give international students more sufficient time to conduct research or refine engineering skills by involving into industrial projects' every phase of the life cycle. 

It will also make The United States become a more attractive place for study aboard. As we known, international students are creating hundreds of billions of purchase in the US, thus stimulating the economy development of the US. It's a beneficial rule for both US economy and international students no matter in long term or short term.
