I STRONGLY SUPPORT this proposed rule. Because STEM students are utilizing what they have gained from U.S. universities to build America a stronger country. It is NOT about hurting American workers because companies hires international students to accomplish the work that Americans are not able to OR prefer not to do. Therefore, the opposite commenters truly need to find a way to enrich their knowledge first. In addition, i am firmly believe competition and diversity will directly contribute to U.S. economy and make everyone live a better life. All discussed above proves STEM OPT period required to be extend to 24 months.
