I support the expanding policy of OPT extension for F-1 nonimmigrant students for the following reasons. I'm a food science majored graduate student. In my class, there are about 20-30% of students holding a F-1 visa. From the US government stand point, US will lose at least 20% high-tech people if the extension fails to approve. On the other hand, many of the students come in US and they feel they love here. They bring their parents, friends come to US for a short visit, which will definitely boost economy. More important, extension to 24 months is right to the point that people with great knowledge or potential to serve US can get green card to stay longer while others not good enough will be kick out. In conclusion, I do think US should approve the extension for a win-win situation.
