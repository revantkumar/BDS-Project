As a STEM student working in the silicon valley, I feel that US IT industry heavily relies on foreign talents. This industry will absolutely suffer without all these talented workers from all over the world. Numerous US employers have benefited from the skills acquired by STEM OPT students while they are studying in the US. These students also help US industry to expand overseas, recently Uber is growing fast in Asia market like India and China. 

What's more, international students have made significant contributions to the United States, both through the payment of tuition and other expenditures in the U.S. economy, as well as by significantly enhancing academic discourse and cultural exchange on campuses throughout the United States. In addition to these general benefits, STEM students further contribute through research, innovation, and the provision of knowledge and skills that help maintain and grow increasingly important sectors of the U.S. economy. My home country warmly welcomes overseas students to come back and make contributions to the local economy. Personally I don't mind working in my home country and I believe I will after a fews years as my home country has a much better market. US market has no potential to grow if it expels all talented young people from US.
