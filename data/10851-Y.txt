I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. As for most of the international students, they did not take the working chances of the U.S. citizens with a lower salary. Instead, they have made a great effort competing for the high-tech jobs which really few U.S. citizens are competent at. So the competition can help the U.S. select talented people better and improve the capability of everyone. No matter international students or domestic students, they can enhance the competitive strength of the U.S. 
2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. Many successful people in the U.S. nowadays are former international students. The fact has proved that these international students are able to apply the knowledge they have learned and make contributions to the society. So why can't they get the chances to work in the U.S.
