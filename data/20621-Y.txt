U.S. is an immigrant nation since 1776. The immigrants always bring vigor and fortune to this great nation in different history periods. Modern times, many developed countries face stagnant economy while U.S still maintain economic vitality, immigrants should take some credits for the achievement. OPT extension is not just benefits international students, in long term, it also benefit the whole U.S. economy, therefore benefits the native individuals. Companies hire international students not only because the relatively cheap labor costs but because they can't find enough qualified educated employees in domestic labor market. It means after expel immigrants, people who can't get jobs right now still can't get jobs since jobs in STEM field require high-skills and professional knowledge. In opposite, if companies can hire more educated international students, the labor demands will be satisfied. Hence companies can expand its business scale and creat more jobs includes entry-level positions for natives. Thus, OPT extension is a win-win scenario for both sides. Hope everyone has foresight.
