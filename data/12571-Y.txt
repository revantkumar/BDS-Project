This initiative is a great thing for the US. Some people are afraid that this hurts the interest of US citizens. I would argue that it's opposite. This initiative is not to "put foreigners above US citizens" as someone mentioned, there is not privilege for foreign students. And remember, this 2 years is necessary for the US to find the best people to keep. This is fundamentally different from granting immigration!
