I absolutely SUPPORT the proposal for the new 24 month-extension of STEM OPT. 12 months of OPT are meaningless because it usually takes 6 months or 12 months to train students and let them get familiar with the work. If OPT only has 12 months, employers will not want to hire students because they know these students have to leave after a short period of time. In summary, 12 months = nothing. Many talented people will not be able to use OPT and have to leave without extending it. One great power that makes the U.S. a strong country is that it attracts talented people from all over the world. Extending OPT will not help unqualified people get their jobs. It is just one important step to let those skilled people make contributions to the country.
