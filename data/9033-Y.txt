I strongly support the proposal:

1. Most international students have done lots of contributions in U.S., especially in technology and science areas. More time for them to stay in U.S. facilitate the academic and industry develop in the whole country.

2. Competition is not the excuse for revoke this proposal at all. Most international students who can have the job and stay in the states have outstanding skills to contribute to the whole country. They have strong academic background. Therefore, there are no competitions between international students and general native workers (who haven't received advanced degrees) at all.

3. As we know, most highly developed companies like Google, LinkedIn, Facebook have a lot of international students. As there is no guarantee for international students to get H1B at the first time, less OPT time will definitely cause a huge brain drain in these great companies. No talents, no technology, no development for this country.
