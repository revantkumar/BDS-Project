I strongly support the extension of OPT. I don't think the OPT will decrease the job opportunities for American for several reasons. One is that for people not in the STEM major, this extension has totally no effect on them. They needn't worry about that. Another is that if IT companies can hire more intelligent people, it actually help the company grow and make more job opportunities. So American students in STEM major needn't worry about that as well because all these companies will grow faster and they will have more opportunities.
