I certainly support the OPT extension for STEM students.

First of all, such extension keeps US attracting talented students who would have more time working for the country.

Secondly, 12-month OPT is obciously not long enough for some projects, which would probably take 2-3 years to finish.

Last but not least, OPT extension is also important for F-1 students, who would have an extended time in practical training.

So, I strongly support OPT extension for STEM students.
