I support the ruling to extend OPT for F-1 nonimmigrant students for the following reason.

These F-1 students have been in the US LEGALLY for school and they will work in the US LEGALLY, opposite to the false accusation in some negative comments. STEM students came to US colleges and graduate schools, whose admission rules are merit-based, because of their talent and potential to be qualified scientist, engineer in their respective field of study after training. It is unwise to only provide them one year of OPT (if no extension) for them to make contributions to the US economy.
