It is unjust, shortsighted and against the interest of American people to deprive international students' legal right to work in US after graduation simply because they are not citizens. In addition, the belief that minimum wages cannot get raised because there are too many international students is also unreasonable and against fact. I am strongly convinced that allowing international students to prosper in the US would bring in far more jobs than the number saved by driving them out. 

International students are making huge contributions to our country. Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010. Most international students work in scientific and technology, and many of them are among the best in their fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to aim at in order to continue its leadership in the world.

For most international students. When they achieved a bachelor or masters degree in the US, usually they have spent at least $100,000 in education, let alone other consumptions for living or shopping. However, it is not reasonable to assume that they could accept low pay, given that they have already invested so much. International students are by no means cheap labor. 

American people are wise enough not to harm our long-term benefits by irrational fear and temporary, illusive satisfactions. International students are helping America grow, and are improving the welfare of American people. Losing them, on the other hand, will benefit our competitors and harm US interest. I strongly believe we should pass this proposal and pass more bills in the congress that could make it easier for the international students to stay.
