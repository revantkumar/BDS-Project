I strongly support this proposal. 
a.Talented immigrants have been one of the most powerful sources that made U.S. the worlds greatest country and I cannot believe were trying to give away the talents to our rival countries.
b.The development of the medical system, insurance policies, and more convenient life for normal American citizens is based on the fastest-growing IT industry around the world. We cannot deny that talented international STEM students have been making contributions to this.
c.Americans with a STEM background, as long as theyre qualified for the positions theyre applying for, are always preferred over international students and are in easy reach of higher-salary, management-level roles compared against STEM students.
d.All STEM students PAID EXPENSIVE TUITION to come to the states to study and then make contributions. Its not like they simply come here and immediately get jobs easily. The REMOVAL of opt stem will cause FINANCIAL LOSS for U.S. Universities because they can actually go to other developed countries and serve them.
In sum, I strongly support this proposal and believe this is a beneficial policy for everyone.
