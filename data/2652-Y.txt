We strongly hope that OPT for STEM student will be expanded. I am working for my friend on his project of medical improvement treating cancer and other serious disease, and we are just right on our way to help people suffering from cancer, make them to have a better treatment, and it will be so sad for people to have their treatment interrupt and cancelled just because of the OPT can't going on. International students are not pocessing more working oppotunities from the U.S. citizen, it is even hard for those students to get a good job, and if the OPT could not expand, the companies are not going to give the oppertunity to the students, most of the students in their OPT are not working for citizenship, they just want to making some effort with the knowledge they learned from this place, so that will become a good performance on their resume and people here in United States are getting help from those technic professional students, life will be better.
