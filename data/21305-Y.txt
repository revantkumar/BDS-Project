From my point of view, it is high time for our government to put a extension on STEM students, because these students are diligent and contribute a lot to US IT economy.For normal Americans, these students will also fill in the gap and create more jobs for normal Americans. For a visionary point, these students are the key to hold the booming economy in US.It is very important for DHS to provide longer time for STEM students.
