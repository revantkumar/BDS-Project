Dear Sir:

I am writing you regarding the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. I am a recent graduate student of Bradley University, Illinois. A vast majority of graduate students are international students and most of them are in the United States on F-1 visas. Me and many of my friends will be affected by the Proposed Rule.

I support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I'm glad to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months.

OPT and OPT extension is important to me because after completing my B.S. I directly came to USA to get a degree in Mechanical engineering. Even after completing my M.S. I feel that as all my experience is from academic projects I am not yet ready for contributing as a mechanical engineer. With Optional Practical Training I will be exposed to real work environment and learn how to implement academic knowledge in real life situation. 

I am very concerned with the possibility that the STEM extension might be disrupted by recent court actions, upcoming court actions, and delays in this rulemaking process. I commend DHS for working quickly to prepare this new Proposed Rule.

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule and thank you for all of your hard work and providing educational and training opportunities to F-1 students.

Best regards
