I strongly SUPPORT this proposal. 

1. The STEM students are the strongest push of the economic development of the US. The technology industry is making a FORTUNE for the US government. Don't push them away and LOST the money.

2. Diversity is important for the nation. More than 98% of the population of the US is immigration. This is the reason why the US is so strong right now. This is the SPIRIT OF AMERICA. 

3. The STEM students are not trying to take jobs away from the citizens. The job provided to the students are very limited. Most of the companies they don't hire the international. And for those companies that do, it's also very hard for an international student to get the job. Because the company would have much higher standard for the international.

Overall, the OPT extension does much good to the country!
