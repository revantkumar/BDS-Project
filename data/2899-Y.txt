I strongly SUPPORT the OPT-extension and this is not because I'm a F1 student or I was or will be working on OPT.

This is simply for the following reason:

If students from all over the world come here to study, they are generating revenue for U.S. universities and businesses and after they complete their studies why don't they deserve to work here. All international students pay hefty tuition fee to study here, its the responsibility of the country to keep the good talent here. I don't think if anyone whether its U.S. citizen or not is unemployed if he or she has that capability and skills to perform in their respective field.
