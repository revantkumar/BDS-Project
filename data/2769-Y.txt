Feiyue Long The unemployment issue should and could only be solved in the developement of enconomy rather than over protection. The flourish of economy can't be realized with the limitation of free flow of fund, material and people. We should make a bigger cake together so everyone could get his fair share instead of stare on the existing small cake while worry someone else take it away. OPT extension would keep the talents in the States and therefore help to make a bigger "cake".
