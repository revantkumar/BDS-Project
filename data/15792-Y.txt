I strongly support OPT extension. American is proud to have the spirit to give everyone equal chance. F1 students should have the equal right, at least in first several years, to work in US. F1 students are intellect people from all over the world. And their work in US definitely benefit this country. According to investigate, the jobs that F1 students do has no effect on the employment rate of Americans. Also, the extension gives F1 students the chance to get more working experience. In all, OPT extension benefits the US and F1 student.
