I'd like to talk about some serious potential damage on the IT industry of the US if this OPT expansion is canceled. 

1. Canceling OPT will lose a lot of incoming international students. 

2. Since the majority of current IT engineering student are international students (take my major Computer Graphics as an example, there is only one US citizen out of 19), Company like Google will soon be a lack of educated IT programmers.

3. If company like Google is suffering from recruiting and have a bad time, it can be harmful to the US economy, which at last will result in the drop of positions provided to US citizens. 

On the other hand, passing this OPT and attracting more international students won't be a problem for finding jobs of US citizens, since we usually have different majors.

In a word, canceling rule will bring no advantage in long term but only harm to the US society.
