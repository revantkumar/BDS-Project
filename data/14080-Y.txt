The Proposal specified improving OPT extension for F-1 students with STEM degrees is obviously benefit for many aspects of United States.

First of all, there is not doubt that right now high-tech companies have a amount of foreign employees, which make a great different on development of these companies even United States. If OPT extension is invalid, a lot of foreign employees have to come back their nation or go to other countries. It will cause a tremendous talent drain in these companies and the United States. 

Secondly, as we know, the United States is a immigration country. The reason why USA keep prosperous and booming for a long time in the world is cased by the Diversity and Tolerance. Many famous scientists and CEOs were international students before they gained their achievements. There are many the kind of successful examples around us. 

Thirdly, the proposal will provide international students a opportunity to utilize their skills and knowledge on the work space in a country that have most advanced management system and technologies. Absolutely it is attractive to talented students selecting universities in USA for pursing there degree. Most of international students in my class decided pursing further studying in United state because of OPT and OPT extension.
