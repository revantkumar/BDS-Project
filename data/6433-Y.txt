As an international student, I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons:

First, as we all know, the United States is a developed country which has the most advanced technology, which is the reason why the United States attracts so many international students every year. We appreciate the knowledge we acquired here and would like to do something return to this country. This is the main reason we need OPT extension.

Second, from my own observation, international students accounts for a primary part in the field of technology, say, computer science. As for me, I am also a graduate student work in this area. If international students cannot get the OPT extension, internet companies will lose a huge part of excellent employees, which will definitely obstacle the development of these companies and then may influence US economy significantly.

Third, each position has specific requirements and employees must match these requirements. If a position has much more foreigners than US citizens, this means that the company cannot find enough qualified US citizens for the position since most companies prefer US citizens comparing with foreigns for the lower cost in recruiting and fewer troubles in the future considering identification. Therefore international students will not bring too many competitions to US citizens but fill in the shortage of qualified employees in certain area.

Therefore, I do hope this proposal could be approved. That will both benefits the US and international students ourselves!
