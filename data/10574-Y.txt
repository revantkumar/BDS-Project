Joshua Rampling Technology is what makes America super power in the world. All the American citizens must support this rule. I think this is a great step by DHS which would definitely promote new inventions and innovations in field of science and technology. There is no doubt that to advance our economy and our society we need to create the next great technology innovations, not just consume them. That's why there is such urgency for the U.S. to develop a stronger workforce of experts in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Hiring international students does not mean stealing jobs from Americans. I personally did not see ANY American students with STEM degrees and decent GPAs get unemployed. There will be adequate time for students to devote for the country where they studied several years..
