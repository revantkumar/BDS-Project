I applaud this proposal by the Homeland Security Department to improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 non-immigration STEM students.

America is a country driven by STEM technologies. Keeping international students of STEM fields in the country is an essential step towards retaining and accelerating America's leadership in the world. It satisfies the interests of both American companies and American people. I hope that the new rule can be passed as soon as possible.

May God bless America!
