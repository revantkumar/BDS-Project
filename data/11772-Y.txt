Thank you for making this great proposal. We worked hard and applied every knowledge and skill sets we've learned from US educational programs to our jobs in the US. I'm working in the environmental field and I love what I'm doing. I would appreciate if there is more time to allow me make more contributions to my job and to the environment.
