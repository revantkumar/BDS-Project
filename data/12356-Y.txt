Just want to make it clear about one misleading point in (a lot of) comment(s): Foreign students DO pay taxes and DO NOT learn and work at the American taxpayer's expense.

1) Foreign students who work in U.S., no matter on-campus work or off-campus work, they pay taxes. The only difference between foreign students and local American people is that there's a signed treaty that American government and foreign government will exempt certain amount of income from taxation. It is a equal treaty applies to Americans working in foreign country and foreigners working in U.S.. For countries do not have such treaty with U.S., their citizens DO pay taxes while working on American soil.

2) Foreign students who use American public education resources, pay for what they use. There's a non-resident fee specifically applied to foreign students making them to pay at least twice as much as local American students, or even more in some schools. They do not learn at American taxpayers' expense.

3) As a matter of fact, foreign students pay taxes when they are working in U.S. but they are not able to enjoy the benefit because of current immigration policy. That's why there's tax reduction or exemption for students who work under OPT, and that's why this policy makes sense and needs to be retained and expanded.

Thank you for reading.
