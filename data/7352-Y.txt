Jason Mars I strongly SUPPORT the OPT extension regulation. There are also many international students cannot get a job after graduation, and they actually go back to their country. For those who can find a job in the competitive job market, I believe that they deserve to get a work visa. However, these graduates need time to get their H1B visa, so I believe the extension is fair for these guys.

I don't know why there are so many comments stating that the existing of foreigner workers made them unemployed. I believe that most companies are hiring based on their knowledge and experience, not on their nationality or immigration status. This is the United States, and all men are created EQUAL!
