First of all. I strongly agree with the STEM degrees OPT extension!

I am in Bay area and take Uber and Lyft frequently and talked with divers, a lot of them are local. I have discussed with them several times about foreign techs. As a result, most of their opinion is that foreign tech people help the industry grow and they are passionate to be part of it! In addition, they got a lot of driving requests from these people, where their income comes from! 

As we known, graduated STEM students is one of the main parts of foreign techs. STEM OPT is the way for these students to stay in USA. Therefore, STEM degrees OPT extension is definitely beneficial for both USA and STEM students!
