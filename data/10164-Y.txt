I support this rule as it will benefit not only foreign students but also US economy. US high education institutes have spent a lot o resources to train these talented young people, there's no reason to just force them leave without making any value. Besides, the STEM students have already been an indispensable part of the economy, especially for those high-tech, bio-related companies. It is certain that a large amount of such companies as well as their US employees will face a big crisis if these foreign employees are forced to leave.
