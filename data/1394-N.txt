My name is Thomas R Pritchard and I live in Cape Coral Florida.

I want to know if the Directors appointed by President Barack Hussain Obama HATE America so deeply that you will destroy this country any way you can.

With MILLIONS of people, citizens and LEGAL green card holders, out of work, companies like Disney forcing AMERICANS to train FOREIGN workers to take their jobs and IDIOTS like you wanting to bring into MY country more foreign workers why don't you step down?

How in Gods name can YOU look at yourself in a mirror and not be ASHAMED? You Democrats are fools and in many cases traitors to America.

Please resign so this country has a chance of being restored from the CHANGE committed by this President.

Thank you
