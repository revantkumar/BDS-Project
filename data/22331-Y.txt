I strongly support the new 24 month STEM OPT rule.
I came here more than 2 years ago. I think many people come here from other countries to chase the American dream, and they should have the chance. As we all know, many of non-immigrant students major in STEM are playing an important role in companies and some of the job position in which we might not have proper or enough American citizens to fill. its actually a win-win and we should support it.
