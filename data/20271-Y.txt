I strongly support this decision. Being a Ph.D. student in a big Computer Science department of a major University, I find only a small fraction of my classmates (less than 10%) are Americans. Imagine if OPT extension is cancelled, who are to fill in the tens of thousands tech companies needs each year, who will develop the websites you browse everyday, and who will make your life more convenient. We are not stealing jobs. It's just Americans that are in STEM fields are really few. You need us to fill in the job positions to keep the US strong, and we need this job experience because now US is still the strongest nation.
