OPT extension is a win-win for both US and international STEM students. It will help the companies grow, creating more jobs. Every job only is filled by the most eligible person with the required skills set. Companies in US don't make any distinction between people except on the skill set. This is a work culture commendable, in that they take into account the growth of the company and the economy at large and don't consider anything else.
