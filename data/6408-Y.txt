Shanshan Li I strongly support this policy. I know most of the citizens may think that the F-1 non-immigrant students may take their jobs if the policy passed. This idea is so shallow. People with ability will only bring more working opportunities. America is keep developing. If we got more chance to select correct person in the correct position. We will develop faster and create more working opportunities and better welfare for local people. Diversity and equity make America strong. Resistance to change will only lead to parochialism.
