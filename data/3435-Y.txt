Kavya Yerrabandi I strongly support the OPT Extension rule. I am a masters student. Before coming to US for masters I was searching for various opportunities. But, I chose to do my masters here because this country was giving a large scope for practical learning during the OPT period. This rule would really help us achieve that and justify our purpose of doing masters.
