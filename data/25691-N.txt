I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. The program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. It would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. As a result, it would serve to lower wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program is an inducement to employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage.
Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.
