1. It will attract more and more talented and gifted young people come to US. It also shows how US welcome the students from the whole world.
2. It can help the US economy.
3. There is no way to say that give the same opportunities to other people will deprive the rights and chances that belong to American citizens. The more competitive the people in the talent market are, more attention will put in those talented people. Plus it promotes the development of workers' enthusiasm. 
4.Besides, increasing the time for training help the students service for the US community rather than back to their original country with the knowledge they gained in US without reciprocation.
5.Multicultural working environment benefits the local citizens learn the advantages of another cultures and use it to their works.
