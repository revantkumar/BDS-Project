I think this is a win-win for both US and nonimmigrant students. 

For nonimmigrant students, they will have more opportunities to practice after graduation. Their hard working is also beneficial to stimulate US economy.

For US, it will be more attractive to international students and therefore more talents will come to US. Also, more students coming will boost up US education market.
