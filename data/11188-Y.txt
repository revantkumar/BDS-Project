I believe a better U.S. economy, based on hard work of talents from all over the world, will definitely create more jobs and improve everyone's living standards. 

I wonder what kinda of people, having the idea of foreigner stealing jobs from Americans, wanna ruin America's economy and push away these talents to other countries. Some similiar ideas :

1) tax anyone who earns more that 10k a year 99% of their extra income 
2) kill any millionaire and spread their wealth among poor people
3) tax products from other countries by 900% so all Americans can only use American products
4) kill all the Chinese so America does not have to pay back the debt
5) you name it
