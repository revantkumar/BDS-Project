I'm glad to see that Homeland Security Department managed to carry out this proposal in such a short time. And I think the 24-month OPT Extension for STEM Degrees makes all sense, and is a good step forward to attract most talented people to further their studies in US.

I'm currently working in a tech start-up using my STEM OPT Extension. My job here is majorly to support our users in China and further explore the Chinese market. I got a Master's degree from University of Pennsylvania in Materials Science, and my company is working on the characterization of nanoparticles. It's perfect to have this chance to apply what I have learnt in Upenn in the real world. I'm grateful that my boss gave me this opportunity to market our instrument to China, which calls for technical skills and also my background as a Chinese. However, the initial 1 year OPT is obviously too short for this project. (And I'm sure this situation applies to most STEM projects in most companies.)In this case, I believe the 24-month OPT Extension can give us plenty time to better execute this project, hence, to bring benefit & profit to our company (In a larger picture, to bring benefit & profit to US society).
