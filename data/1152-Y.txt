Roy Shen I support this rule not because this provides more time for international students staying in states have more time on their projects or work, also having more time will providing more opportunities for native workers and creating benefits for United States. The longer international students stay, more opportunities they have. For example, they can open startup company providing more positions for enriching states' economics. So I strongly on the supporting side.
