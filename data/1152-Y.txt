Dear fellow American STEM students/professionals, please give this proposal your fullest support coz the cancellation of STEM will lead to fewer job opportunities and lower salaries for us eventually!!

I work in the IT industry and know that international students from a STEM background earn salaries no less than us (if they're qualified and can get a job in this industry in the States). What's been affecting the industry salary level is, drum roll, OUTSOURCING!!! The cancellation of STEM will lead to a smaller pool of qualified candidates and more corporate greedy enough to lower their costs will turn to outsourcing eventually as their option!!! That's the NIGHTMARE WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE!! 

If we continue ousting these international STEM students, we'll face probably fewer job opportunities and lower salaries!! Think about the cheap tech labor in China and India. They will be the competition against us, which is the opposite of what we need!!!

Don't be shortsighted and let short-term, so-called "interest" blind you!! Stop opposing STEM and please SUPPORT the PROPOSAL for OUR OWN SAKE!!!
