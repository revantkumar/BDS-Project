I think this is a very important piece of legislation that needs to be passed!! I have many friends that would benefit from this new rule with STEM Degrees. They are good, smart, and hard working people that are contributing to our society in numerous ways! These are the people we should want to keep in the US helping make it a better place to live. We are a nation of immigrants and to deny some of the brightest minds a chance to stay here in a America after building their lives here for how ever longs seems very cruel to kick them out even though they are improving our society as a whole. These STEM degree students will help produce more cutting edge research and technology so please consider passing this rule. Give these students a fair shot at making it here in America.
