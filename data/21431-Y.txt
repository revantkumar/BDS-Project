I fully support the new change of increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months instead of the current 17 months. I believe this increased duration of practical training is important for students to fully utilize the education they received. This option gives the students greater flexibility and time for students to find their dream jobs here in this great nation which will result in their own personal growth and well being. This is also imperative to maintain this nation's economic, scientific, and technological competitiveness.
