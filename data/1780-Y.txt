I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S universities to continue stay in the U.S. so that they can make contributions to the U.S.

2. America has always been a country of diversity, and embraced so many international students/ scholars in the past years. And these international students/scholars did not disappoint the U.S. because they made their contributions, and some are even more impressive than native students. International students are the INDISPENSABLE force in the U.S industry, especially in the STEM field. 

3. It is fair for companies to recruit employees BASED ON MERITS instead of citizenship because they can maximize the profit in this way. And competition is not a bad thing - it can propel native students to study harder work harder. And to clarify, international students are NOT competing with native students with a lower wage. The company just cannot find a more capable person. For example, the number of native students that are applying to do research is LOW. Therefore if the company wants someone to do the research, THEY NEED INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS because native students do not like doing research and they need someone to do the work. So if you think native students are being out-competed, then it is better to improve the capability of native students instead of trying to block more capable people out. I don't see the problem of treating people BASED ON MERITS.
