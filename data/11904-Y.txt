I strongly support this proposal. The OPT STEM Extension is a win-win policy for the STEM graduates, the STEM employers, and also the employed / unemployed US citizens. It is obvious that the OPT extension benefit the STEM graduates and employers, but many people suspect that it will hurt the job opportunity of US citizens. I will briefly present how the extension can help the US employees, and even the unemployed people.

The condition of the U.S. economy highly affect the job opportunities and job security for US citizens. 
As a powerful engine of economy, high-tech industries heavily rely on the very talented and highly qualified foreign STEM students, to keep their business making profits, which is a critical factor that fuel the U.S. economy, so that more job opportunities can be created for the US citizens.

Taking a look at how many MS/PhD STEM degrees are conferred to foreign STEM students every year, it is clear that the US doesn't have enough qualified US graduates to support the high-tech industries. Without the STEM students, many projects, innovations, and new products can not be accomplished.

The talented foreign students are making their contributions to make the US a better place to live and work, for all the people here. Therefore, I strongly support this new rule.
