The Student Visa Program is used by people from foreign countries to gain entry to this country, acquire food stamps, welfare, and interest-free $50,000.00 loans for businesses. Even citizens cannot obtain "interest-free loans" from the government that I know of! That's why almost everywhere you go in this country you see gas stations owned by Arabs (Muslims) and Indians (from India). Why are established citizens of this country denied this?. There are already TOO MANY PEOPLE in this country and too much money thrown away for foreigners. That is why this country is practically a strip mall from coast to coast.

Your common sense in this matter will be appreciated!

Sincerely, Teri Walker
