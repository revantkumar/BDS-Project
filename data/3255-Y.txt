The students who come to the US are among the best in their countries. The Us is getting the gift of basically educated students who are inspired and want to perform. If they are allowed to stay, they will further contribute to the vast storehouse of competence and job creation that immigrant businessmen and educated employees have made, are making and will continue to make for the betterment of The United States of America.

Why do you want to throw away this gift by sending them away?.
