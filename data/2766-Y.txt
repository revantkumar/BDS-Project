I firmly believe that this proposal is good for the students as it gives them top notch training at some of the best technology companies of the world, as US is the technology leader of the world. The US too needs to accommodate such talents to maintain its lead in this field. So, it is a win-win situation for both. A 24 month extension would give that extra amount of time for the students to explore the opportunities here before they can take a decision on their career.
