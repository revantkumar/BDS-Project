I was attracted to study in the United States partly because there are OPT and OPT extension. As a STEM F1 student who is graduating at the end of this year, I have accepted a job offer and planning to gain some work experience as part of my study plan. OPT, especially OPT extension, greatly helps my plan and future career path. I won't even characterize myself as someone who has good work experience if I can only work for one year without the extension. I would really recommend the pass of this rule in order to make the F1 STEM programs more attractive to students who would like to gain good work experience in the US.
