As a foreign student myself, of course I support this proposal :D
I am not going to talk about "american dreams" but just take a look at http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf
you might notice that "The Fortune 500 companies that boast immigrant or
children-of-immigrant founders have combined revenues of $4.2 trillion. $1.7 trillion of
that amount comes just from the companies founded by immigrants." Immigrants do make huge contributions.

I looked into those opposed reviews and find mostly they are emotional complains and says that "US government puts foreign students over US citizens".

This is really ridiculous to me, just look at those companies at your career fair, how many of them could support visa sponsorship? How many of them really hire non citizens? If you get laid off or think your wage is low, have you ever review what you have done? Will a company really lay off or give low wage to a very skillful worker? Why blame foreign students because of your own unfortunate? 
We go through a narrower way to our career, pay the same tax, earn the same money, spend and contribute our youth and passion on this land called FREEDOM and EQUALITY, we deserve anything but prejudice and discrimination.
