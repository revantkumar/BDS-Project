I'm doing my Phd in the US as an international student, I believe if the government cancel the OPT extension, this will definitely lead to economical damage to the enterprises who are currently employing international students or potential employees. Most importantly, if the cancellation of the OPT extension comes into implementation, international students, who make giant contribution to the US economy, will be plummeting in numbers, this will turn out more more unemployment which means more American citizens will lose their jobs.
