SRI KRISHNA CHAITANYA BUTANAPALLI Yes i support the expansion. It really gives students a good time to boost their career with the training they takes in companies over there in US who spends lots of money for their Masters. It doesnt matters how long would be the extension but it matters whether USA takes care about the international students who took decisions for Masters in USA from the countries all over the world.As the students who are undergoing with the jobs are paying taxes for the government of USA. No where the sign of employment has fully taken over by foreign students but not americans. An article that states a lot of opportunities are out here for the people but we require man power . So foreign students are not at all dragging the every opportunity in the jobs but they are getting because of the interest they show towards them. The worlds Big Man should not take such decision on a side to cancel as it effects thousands of students who are already there , who want to come also which indirectly shows its effect on treasury also to be considered.I expect everything goes well for the OPT extension which gives a hope for the students to enhance their career with the help of THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

Thank You UNITED STATES.
