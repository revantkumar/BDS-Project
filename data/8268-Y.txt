I strongly agree with this program. I don't voice for international students here, but I have to question protesters, have you ever reasoned why you lost your job? Because you are an American? No. Because you have never thought about your personal problems and just come here to say nonsense about the government. How can you easily get a job if you never learn new stuff and are addicted to parties everyday? I vote for this rule, because I just hate to see so many American people are so hopeless, who can just blame the government and curse foreigners. We don't expect you to build our country, but please let other talented people to build our American dreams. No matter what rule it is, I just want American people to stop being a coward and fight for themselves!
