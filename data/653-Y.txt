I strongly support the stem extension because it is very important that people who have their degrees in the U.S can stay in the states and make contributions. Diversity is also really important to the growth of a country. Although competition does exist, it is not a bad thing. It promotes the working efficiency to a great extent. We can not against OPT because of racial bias and merely fear of competition. That is really bad thoughts!
