Zhang kangkang I strongly support the opt extension.
As a student major in computer science, I surely won't consider the US if there is no opt extension. The thing can be learned in university is very limited, a lot of new technique can only be learned in a company. The things that attract me is not only university but also hi-tech company there. If there is only one year for me to work in the US, I think I cannot get what I want to learn. Considering the big cost that I have to spend to studying in the US to get a master degree when there is so little time for me to improve my real skill, I won't choose to go to the US.
