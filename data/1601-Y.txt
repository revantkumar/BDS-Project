I think this proposal is really great! Diversity is the foundation of USA. With more and more great STEM students in our nations will be not only a great potential for our economy development but also a push to us US citizens, which means everyone in this country should work hard and earn the same opportunity to get a happy life. The extension of STEM students' OPT donate them more time to win a chance to stay in US,the more energy and experience they will get in their careers, thus the more contribution to the development of USA. This policy is not just about them, it's about the future of our society. Everyone wish a prosperous future for our country, then everyone should open to more challenges when they are in job market.
