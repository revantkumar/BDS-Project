what is the use of bringing more people into the country if there are no jobs to the people of this country..This rule is a big game being played by corporate companies to bring cheap labor into the country and also universities to get more money from giving more admissions to foreign nationals..STOP THIS RULE OR AMERICA WILL LOOSE ITS GLOBAL LEADER IMAGE IN FUTURE YEARS as there will be lot of unemployment rate increases.
