My comment is to request that we keep the American worker, the American citizen and the American economy as our focus. Meaning please consider what is best for our American citizens. 

There were two very important factors relating to the proposed expanded OPT program of DHS which came from a Freedom of Information Act request. This request was directed to the Center for Immigration Studies.
1. OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013.
2. OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.

I am a senior citizen. To me this proposed expansion is not a good idea. We have many USA Tech graduates that need jobs but cannot find them. Thus their time and money spent getting a good education is wasted. 
It appears that the major benefactor of this program are the companies who hire these non-American citizens. There do not have to pay taxes on their wages and they can hire them for low wages.
Also the FBI report that these OPT workers are too many to keep track of. The USA is opening itself to ever increasing security risks.
