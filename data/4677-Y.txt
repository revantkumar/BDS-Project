I strongly SUPPORT OPT extension rule.

When I graduated from university in China, I have plenty of choice to continue my graduate study in U.S, Canada, Hong Kong, British or Singapore. However, I finally choose to study in U.S because of the STEM OPT extension rule. With such rule, U.S can provide me with industrial training during and after my graduation. Therefore, OPT extension rule is a very attractive factor to international students when they are choosing school. I'm wondering whether U.S is still able to attract large amount of STEM talents to study in U.S and contribute to U.S without such OPT extension rule.

Besides, if the rule is terminated in Feb next year, it will be a disaster to silicon valley, since most big-tech companies such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Apple, Google and so on depend on foreign STEM talents. A certain amount of engineers in such companies have to quit their job and go back to their home town. This is a huge loss to U.S.

Moreover, from my current work experience, 12 month regular + 24 month extension is a good length for OPT program. Most large projects in big-tech companies last at least 3 years or more. With the limited number of H1B every year, not every STEM talent can get H1B visa. If OPT extension rule is terminated, these STEM talents have to quit their job before the project complete. Companies have to spend money and time to hire and train another person to finish the project, which is a time waste job during project period, and will increase the operating expense.

OPT extension rule is not only good to international students, but also beneficial to U.S economy. Hope more and more people support such rules!
