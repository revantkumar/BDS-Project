Smita Bailur According to a study from a reputed university, each highly skilled immigrant in the STEM field can create close to 3 jobs. As an International student and STEM graduate, I want to see this rule published and implemented without adversely affecting the 1000's of highly skilled and highly motivated students in F-1 status who are contributing to U.S. innovation, scientific discovery, technological improvements and the U.S. economy. This will allow the US to continue being the growth engine of all scientific and technological innovation like it has been in the last 150 years. This will allow a huge number of jobs in allied fields to be created as a result of opening up the borders to the smartest and most talented people.
