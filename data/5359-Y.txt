I strongly support this rule for two reasons:
1. Extended OPT will attract more talented students to come to US, contributing to the development of US with their talent and hard work. 
2. Giving everyone the equal opportunity is the spirit of US. Talented International students should have more time and chances to practice themselves after their graduation.
