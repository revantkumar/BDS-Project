I strongly support this proposal. It takes time to develop professional knowledge and advanced skills in science and technology area. If the length of OPT could be extended to 24 months, it gives foreign talented people a better chance to make contribution to the united states. From my current work experience, it also took me around a year for training to start to making steady contribution to my project recently.
