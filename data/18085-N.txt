When is the U.S. government going to implement (and enforce) rules that benefit our citizens, and NOT place ANY foreign interest before our own? 

"We The People" shall not be ignored and are sick of having our officials trying as hard as possible to aid all BUT the tax paying United States Citizen while they use our money against our wishes to do so!
