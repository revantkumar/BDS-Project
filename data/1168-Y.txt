Considering the interest of American economy and foreign students, I strongly support the improvement and expansion of training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees and CapGap relief for all eligible F-1 students by lengthening the OPT extension from 17 months to 24 months.
1.This rule can attract more students coming to US to study, which can increase income significantly for American universities. A lot of universities now have over ten percent of international students and for some universities it even reaches over twenty percent. For example, the University of Texas at Dallas where I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree has 23% of international students. Obviously, this brings in humongous revenue for the university, especially in the recent tuition increase.
2.For Ph.D. students hired by high-tech companies, they contribute a lot to the leading technology owned by USA. Usually, it takes several years for them to work out a specific research and development. For example, in my research area of nanoelectronics, it takes 24 months or even longer to push one technology node further in developing transistors and IC circuits. Making the total OPT to be 36 months is a great benefit for the high-tech companies in USA, such as Global foundries, Intel and Micron.
To sum it up, it really benefits both the US economy and US citizens welfare and F-1 student's long-term career.
