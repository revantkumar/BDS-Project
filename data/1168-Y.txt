Anonymous DO extend OPT for STEM students.

I see some comments saying that US citizens do not have more job opportunities because of OPT students. However, we all know that STEM extension only applies to e-verify companies who promise to treat people all the same disregard "national origin or citizenship status". This simply means these companies will not discriminate international students, as well as US citizens. Everyone gets the job because of his own technical ability. So it is meaningless to say that STEM students in OPT will affect US citizens seeking for jobs.
