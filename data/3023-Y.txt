Anne Morris More talents for more jobs.

It's part of our heritage how America has attracted talents worldwide and became the world leader in global currency, national defense, science and technology. The progress we've made with contributions and collaborations with foreign talents has helped us build a strong nation as well as maintain our leadership in various fields. Our founder's vision in equality, democracy, liberty and supporting legal immigration has proven successful with our progress and advantage over many nations in Europe and Asia. Today, we want to continue our tradition in attracting the best talents all over the world, regardless of their race, gender or socioeconomic background, because we know this is how we will sustain our advantage in global competition with the greatest mind power and labor source. When countries like China and Russia have taken the chance ahead of us, employing better talents and challenging our status in industry and technology, we might lose our leadership power and if that happens, Americans might have to seek employment at their doors - that's why we should sponsor and extend programs like OPT and keep the talents in our country, who will in return help revive our economy and industry, and open more doors to opportunity and jobs for America.
