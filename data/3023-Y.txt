I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S, and a lot of international students make contributions on several areas such as IT, Science,and other technical areas.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. International students who has strong science background are a good complement for positions need a strong technical skills. International students always work with Americans very well and prompt the development of American economics.
