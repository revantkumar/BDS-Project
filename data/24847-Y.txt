I support OPT new extension rule. Even some people here said "this adds opportunities to illegals". This is ridiculous!!!!!! STEM international students are graduated from universities with skilled high-tech background and their contribution had brought so much benefits to the US in the past decade. Retaining these STEM international students will bring more benefit and open win-win situation in the US.
