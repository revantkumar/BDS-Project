Thank you so much for your help on our OPT extension opportunities. As an international student, I really want to apply what I have learned to our life, so it is really good for a student. And as a, Engineer, it is more important to learn from work instead of just learning at school. 

Beside, if we get the extension, there may not be so many good student lost their chances, and I think in American, opportunities for every student should be equal. Every student could make a different on their field, and all the inventions and improvement from the real work would make benefits for the people all over the world!

I would like to support this extension. Thank you so much!
