I strongly support the OPT extension. The policy will continue to help promising foreigners to immigrate and thrive in US. Throughout our history, immigration to US has contributed greatly to the strength and character of our Republic. Over the years we have provided for such immigration because it has been to our own national interest that we do so. It is no less to our national interest that we do so under laws that operate equitably. The contribution of immigrants can be seen in every aspect of our national life. We see it in religion, in business, in the arts, in education, even in athletics and in entertainment. There is no part of our nation that has not been touched by our immigrant background. Today, World economy faces great challenge, EU and Japan fell quickly, but our country sustained to thrive. Among many factors, advanced technology contribute most. As far as I know, STEM students are the main forces. Immigrants from India, China and etc played an important role.
