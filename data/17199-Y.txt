I strongly support this new opt extension rule. Firstly, I don't agree that the extension of opt would make companies tend to hire international students than US students. The reasoning that companies would like to hire international students because of less payment has no evidence to support it. First most opt students are working as intern and of course might be paid lower than full-time workers. On the other hand, the payment to interns are the same for both international students and US students based on my experience and the information from others. Actually most company would like hire US students if both international students and US students are qualified. Secondly, I see a lots of benefit for US from the OPT extension. From the academic view, the OPT extension that enables students to gain working experience attract most elites to US. These intelligent students have made significant contributions to academic researches and thus make US the center of the world in academic area. Academic researches also play an important role to drive the growth of economy as we can see from history. Thirdly, the economic effect from international students is very huge. The spend on rental, daily shopping, recreation from international students is very huge and have stimulated the economic growth of towns around university. Especially most students' parents would frequently travel to US and spend significant amount of money on shopping and traveling. However, all the benefits as I mentioned above would disappear if the OPT extension is cancelled.
