As a Phd student on F1 visa, I'm glad to hear that DHS is proposing to prolong opt to 24 months. As an expert in the STEM field, I'll have opportunity to work and contribute to the high tech of US. Without such OPT, a kind of braindrain occurs for US, since elite foreign students cannot work in the US high tech industry that needs real experts all over the world.
