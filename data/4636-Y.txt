I fully support the new rule for several reasons below:
1. STEM students normally need a longer period to complete their practical/training projects. If this rule passes, these students will get more practical experience;
2. One of the most important reasons to choose which country as study abroad is the opportunity to gain practical experience. Compared to Britain, U.S. itself has benefited a lot from the OPT STEM extension rule before since more students, especially STEM students are willing to come to U.S. to pursue their degrees.
3. U.S. economy also benefits from this rule a lot. With this rule, more foreign STEM students will have the chance to work and even found start-ups during the OPT period.

Therefore, I sincerely hope this rule will pass.
