Hongxiang Jia I am strongly agree federal's plan about the extension for STEM non-immigrant students.

United States is a high technology nation which is means everyday there is a chance for the nation to invent something new. However, this will not happen without cooperation. The STEM students are come from all around the world , their mind are more wide. Give them a chance for work is not only a favor to them but also a favor to the United States. STEM students are always able to bring us surprise and make the treasure. 

So leave them and let us make a better future!
