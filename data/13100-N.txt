This program needs to be scrapped in light of the Disney termination of US workers in favor of lower cost replacements from India or wherever. This program results in unfair hiring practices that favor immigrants over our own U.S. tax-paying people. OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013.

A lot of these immigrants have been found to overstay their visas and abuse our social systems either directly or indirectly. OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.

With the debt that the U.S. has, this is an unnecessary burden on our country and citizens.
