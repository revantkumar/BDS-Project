The entire OTC STEM PROGRAM should be stopped until the employment problem is fixed which will not be done until the Obama administration is out of power. The constant over reach of this administration is hurting the economy of this country. Americans should be given preference of foreigners. The COE of large companies are benefiting by lower wages and exemption of FICA taxes. NO OTC STEM LROGRM!!!!! BC
