I strongly back increasing OPT for three reasons.
1) It helps students practice what they have mastered theoretically. Engineering is application based. And without the opportunity to get Practical training, theoretical knowledge is not of much use.

2) With new opportunities, people have seen a tremendous increase of startups. With new startups,new jobs are created. All employees, irrespective of immigration status, contribute to taxes collected for the development of the country. It is important to notice how many jobs have been created in the past 10 years due to having a diverse population from different countries.

3) If OPT is not extended, the chance of getting H1B Visa in the first year after start of OPT is very less. People have to return to square one without having much application experience. All the hard work that students put in to get their master's degree, hinges on their hope to get some practical exposure after graduation.

4) Denying OPT extension to immigrants will create a hostile environment to students, and this will in turn deter more students from coming to the USA to pursue their higher education.

5) I feel that OPT extension is good for both immigrants and the country, looking at the big picture.
