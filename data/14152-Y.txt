I strongly SUPPORT the 24-month OPT STEM extension proposal for the following reasons:

In today's American Universities, more and more international students are enrolled in academic departments. A majority of them specialize in those areas such as Finance, Economics, Engineering and Science. With the growth of employees in those high-tech companies, there is no doubt that in every aspect of American society - including education, sciences, arts and so on - will benefit greatly from international influences. If the STEM OPT Extension is canceled next year, it will affect a multitude of international employees working for creating prosperous American economy and technology. Such restrictions would be devastating to the economies of no only the West but also the East of America.
