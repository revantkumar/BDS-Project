Weiyi Fu I think the opt extension is must for the US universities and companies. 
Firstly, for a very simple reason, one year is NOT enough to finish most of the research projects. A normal proposal e.g. NSF (National Science Foundation) will take at least 2~3 years. It is not possible to hire new researchers every year! Based on the past experiences, it will take several months for a new researcher to fully understand the work of others and continue the development.
For the company, in most of the cases, the new graduate student has to be trained in order to work efficiently in any projects and they need to build good relationship with their partners. This will take several months. If opt is only one year, before they could really create value for the company, they will have to leave because of visa issue. This is great lost for the company.
