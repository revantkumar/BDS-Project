The future of High-Technology industry in US highly depends on the talented and well-trained foreign students who are in STEM major. The employer needs a significant amount of time, at least a few months, in training those fresh graduated students to make a valuable contribution to the company and industry. Only one-year OPT duration (this means only one filling chance for H1B lottery in April) is NOT long enough at all. Moreover, the majority of students in STEM major in US came from developing countries. The reason behind this is those majors are neither attractive nor interesting to most of American. These foreign students are not taking away the high-tech job opportunities from American, but only meet the great demand for high-skill labor and provide a significant contribution to economy, industry, and whole society. Without OPT extension the development of technology and economy in US will slow down significantly in a foreseeable future.
