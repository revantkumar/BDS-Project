I SUPPORT this new proposal, expanding the OPT with STEM degrees will be a win-win for both United States and the international students. 
In STEM industry, the needs for engineers is huge, talented international student graduated from school here in US will be a great assets for those companies in addition to the local talented people.
By extending the OPT, international students can bring more diversity (ideas) to the industry, they can have more time to practice their skills and contribute more to the industry as a return of the education received. The extension would also attracts more students come to US for study, as a result schools and universities will have more budget to improve their facilities and eventually benefit the local students.
