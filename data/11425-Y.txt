U.S is a great place to study and work for. The country has skilled workers and greatest innovations in technology. We build it as a team and let the team survive. How would you feel; when you are doing something big for the people but you have to resume due to conflicts as this. Immigrant is just a name tag but we are americans, working and developing for our better futures. I hope government comes with a decision soon in the favor of all the students and encourage them to study more and invent more wonders.
