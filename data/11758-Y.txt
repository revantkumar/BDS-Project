I totally agree with this proposal. There are some reasons:

1. F-1 Nonimmigrant students can bring the cultural influence to this country, diversified cultures would build a stronger country background;

2. F-1 Nonimmigrant students don't have the nationalities to compete with the Americans, they have to cost a lot of time in the identity. But this country could share their knowledge and skills for a long time to help this country to be stronger and free.

3. America is an immigration country, the biggest and strongest country in the world. She has the tolerance to accept all cultures people to get tougher this country to built a good country. Why refuse and close the doors to other countries people? This is against the justice and American Dream.

4. Everybody rely on their abilities to get a job, not other things. They deserve a longer time to stay in this country to continue their work and job. If their work is disturbed, who could restart the job immediately? Companies have to cost a lot of time to find another person to learn and restart. It would wast a lot of time, money, resources.

5. This is America, we should give everybody the chance to be treated more equal. In the history, we against the Black to have the equal rights with Whites. Now, we against F-1 Nonimmigrant students to stay longer in this country. Why the two things look so similarly? Why we can't share our rights with others. Keeping the resource inside, refuse others to come in, can't solve any problems. Only open the door and share with others, you could create more process and make this country more successful.
