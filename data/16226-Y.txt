I am current second year Chinese student at UCSD. I know that this extension may seem like a threaten to American job opportunities, but in fact it is not. We international students leave our home and work so hard to get better lives. We face more challenges and restrictions when we study here. We never try to put ourselves in the opposite position to Americans. I have made a lot of American friends here during my study and I can say as an International student I try hard to get into the life here. All we are doing is to give ourselves a better life. 
International students are not illegal immigrants. We are approved by US embassy and have offers from colleges in US. We are qualified to be here. We are the intelligent ones who would rather study mysterious of science and math than do illegal activities. We are the safe ones. We obey local laws and do not attempt to get ourselves into troubles. We are not enemies, we are friends.
What we international students are doing here benefit America in numerous ways. First, we pay much more for the tuition, which help release funding pressure. If we do not come here, American students may face further increased tuition and suffer from more loans. Second, we dedicate to our works. We either devote ourselves to research, which benefit humanity and future, or work in corporations that help solve problems. What we are doing here is to create positive things for this country.
So please do not cancel the extension. We just try to fight for our future. We bring more energy to this diverse country. So please keep the extension and we will show how we can benefit this country's future.
