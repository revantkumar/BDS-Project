I find it particularly important to extend student visa with STEM degrees. There is such a need for science students to stay longer, perhaps be qualified to give science classes. Young people in the USA, hi-school students, are avoiding tough graduate/science classes! Too hard, they say!
We could really employ masses of science graduate students, the need is tremendous.
When I came to the USA from Germany a few decades ago, my classmates could not tell the teacher, what is DNA, which amino acids are building blocks of life etc. I was appalled.
We need those different visa to improve SCIENCE teaching in high schools and for many other underserved specialized work places.
