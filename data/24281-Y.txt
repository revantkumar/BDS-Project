Dear good citizens of America,
This proposed policy of extending the time period of OPT for international students in STEM fields is definitely a step in the right direction towards ensuring that the USA remains competitive in this era of globalization. From my experience, international students in STEM fields tend to be relatively more motivated to excel academically than other students. Given the fact that we also pay a tremendous amount of college tuition, often without financial aid, I believe it is only fair that we are given adequate opportunities to pursue such academic experience through OPT as well as enough time to gain concrete experience. Being an international student from Ghana pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology, I have experienced a number of disappointments regarding gaining internships due to my citizenship status and knowing that the current OPT system only allows 17 months to gain such experience makes tertiary education in the United States very daunting for my fellow-international students and me. Since we also have the academic qualifications to attain such employment, I believe this new extension would greatly benefit not only us but also the United States as a whole. With our inherent drive to persevere and succeed, I assure the Government of the United States that implementing this new extension would significantly boost the United States economy as well as ensure that the United States remains very competitive as the superpower the nation is today. Thank you.

Sincerely,
Charles Van-Hein Sackey.
