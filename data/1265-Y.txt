I fully support this plan of expanding training opportunities for international students. The American's educational institutions are losing excellent students for the world, because of the limitation of training period. As far as I know, more and more international students chose to Europe, Australia, or Canada, instead. This loss is harmful to the premium of the American educational system. 

More important, the F1 international students are educated by the American institutes, and some of them are competitive in the market from a global perspective. A better training opportunities can help America public organizations and private sectors identify the needed employees and improve their recruitment. This enhancement of human resources is especially important in areas like higher education, technology, etc. Therefore, this improved policy will eventually benefit the America's economy.
