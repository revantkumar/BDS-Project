Suchi Roy I support the proposal. Does our government really want to lose those students who's learned knowledge from U.S. but never serve for this country? ??????. Let them contribute to this country at least for 24 months....Don't be selfish and waste the education effort that we've put on international students. How this country is gonna attract more young smart kits to this country and work for us if we kicked them away immediately after graduation?
