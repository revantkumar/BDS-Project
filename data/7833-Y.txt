Daniel Miao Personally, I definitely support to extend the OPT program, since as a immigrant country, the diversity is very important to national economic growth and social stability. Especially, the international student who could apply for the OPT is in STEM degree could be very talented and innovative worker to maintain US leadership of the hi-tech industry worldwide. I do not think to extend the OPT will hurt the us Citizen to find jobs; however, in turn, extending OPT could help US economic growth and hi-tech innovation. Since the jobs open to them are very high skill and lack from the citizens. Also, extending OPT could help increasing international talent student come to United States, and these students could contribute a lot to the country not only from the academy perspective but also from the cultural communication with the other countries in the world. I think the big picture is to open more immigrants legally and fairly and to maintain the US leadership in technology and innovation in the world.
