I fully support this proposal although I'm NOT a STEM major. I know a lot of both american and international peers from the STEM background and honestly international peers have to work much harder to have the opportunity to work in the States, even just for 1-2 years. 
Considering their intelligent work and great contributions to the industry and the country, I believe approving the STEM is the fairest to both the nation and the people.
Also, please notice this extension is ONLY affecting the STEM areas but NOT the other majors, so please don't exaggerate how this will affect the job market, because it DOES NOT HURT the job market overall and WILL ACTUALLY give U.S. more job opportunities and increasing support to related booming industries.
