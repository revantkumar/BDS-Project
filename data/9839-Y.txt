Expanding STEM OPT will have good impact and benefit to both international students and America. As the world's largest financial market, international students have experience and ability of living abroad and adapting different culture society. The original intention of STEM OPT exception is because STEM students help America recover and develop market economy. Most of international students consider working in America is the best opportunity they can have in their career life, which push them try their best in their job. 
It is not a solution of increasing local Americans competitiveness by raising the restriction to prevent international students from finding a job. Conservatism will not help the market recover, on the contrary it makes America lifeless and fall behind in the world market competition. The reason why America can become the most developed country is because the open market and talents import. Now, it is also the way that helps American economy and consumer market.
