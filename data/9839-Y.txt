Gail Smith Unemployment in the United States is high and our government should not be making it more conducive for American companies here in the United States to higher foreign students rather than students who are American Citizens. While I understand the underlying motivation of wanting to attract students from around the world, there should be a level playing ground for which American Citizen students and foreign students compete for jobs within the United States. The US Government has no business putting incentives out to companies to hire foreigners over US Citizens. The US Government is choosing winners and losers as is the case being seen around the country where US Citizens workers are not only being laid off but have to train non-citizens so they can take the jobs of US citizens. What in the world is going on with out-o-control agencies flagrantly deciding foreigners are the ones who should get jobs. The US Government is a republic of the People, For the People and by the People...people being Citizens of the United States. I am appalled!!!!!
