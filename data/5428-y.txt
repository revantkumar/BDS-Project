Kalyan Nidumolu I must say I fully AGREE with what the rules saying.

Americans will defend themselves for those OPT students especially from STEM major ruined their opportunity to get a job. I am currently an engineer in silicon valley. I always talk with my teammates about the fact that I have to leave this country if this rule can't pass. Everybody will be angry about this so-called policy to protect their citizens. The boss will not hire a man because they are US citizen or permanent residents. I am paying u to help the company, to help me. From my perspective, if I were a manager, I definitely would like to hire citizen if both the candidates are qualified for this position. But the truth is, the country can't find enough citizens or pr for this quick increasing requirement. If the country keep an narrow mind to exclude those guys with talent because they are not citizen of the great America, then I have to say people will doubt whether it is necessary to keep themselves staying here and dreaming their American dreams. Immigration is the foundation of this land. U guys can't deny this.
