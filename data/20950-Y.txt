I am totally rooting for this policy.
1, I am a student who went to the college in the US and try to find a job this year. I know how tough it is to maintain a legal status in the US while you still need to work to survive. since it is like winning a lottery to have a H1B status as a Chinese, 24 months gives us two chances, which is a life-saving strategy.
2, STEM major takes a big part of Chinese student as we almost major in industrial and science field. This is a huge contribution to the development of US, which we all know that it is the crucial key in the national economics. 24 months of OPT extension makes us more working time period without having to considering about the legal status in the short term, it will allow us work harder, which means more contribution to the national economics, I believe the benefit we are making through this 2 years will facilitate the STEM extension policy in the end.
