Chandra R. Hello All,

I completely support the proposed rule change for STEM OPT extension for 24 months along with CAP GAP. This will give the students an oppurtunity to gain practical knowledge and get well trained in the field where they have learnt throughout academic career. It will not only enhance the skill for the students, give us the oppurtunity to live our dreams. STEM OPT will help to have healthy competition among US universities wherr they can attract more International students which will also benefit US economy.

12 months OPT is great program for International students but we do require more time (STEM OPT) to improve our skills and help the nation to be the best as always.
