umashakar reddy kurli OPT extension is must for international students because the students entered US with the hope that they can work after they complete their master's education in US with H1B visa which can be applied and got during OPT. As only few students can get H1B every year which is purely luck based, so few may gain and few may loss to work. Working in US should not be based on luck bases because lots of students work hard to get into US and deciding their future based on the luck is not good. So giving couple of more chances for the students who loss in the first attempt will be helpful.

As US is land of immigrants, giving chances for educated international people to work will help the country to develop more. Through some articles i got to know that by 2020 the jobs to employers will be 1:1 which means their wont be much competition to get a job even though the graduates every year are in current rate . This means the companies cant get the merit students because all the students who are graduated are not merits which might bring loss to company employee work. Their will still jobs be left for the locals as well as for the international students in feature. So giving them proper visas to work will be helpful.
