I strongly support this act. 

As a car dealer, I could certainly feel that economics boosted by foreign STEM students. Many of my cars are sold to students who gained jobs here. If we lose this student, the car selling will drop down dramatically by about 30 percent. This is very horrible.

Many people today concern about jobs taken. As I manager I think this is ridiculous since I never think HR will give priority for foreign students. I have recruit several international students. The process is quite complicated and our company will not do that unless we could not recruit any American Citizens.
