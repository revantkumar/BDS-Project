Most of the negative comments are absolutely non-sense. Those employers hire STEM international students not because they are cheap. The real reason is that these high tech employers cannot find enough qualified native Americans to meet their need. OPT and OPT extension just offer some policy flexibility for them to be able to ask help from well educated international students. If the current policy allows employer to sponsor H1B for their foreign employee at any time without any quota limit, I believe the majority of them, if not all, will do so. Unfortunately, current H1B lottery has been a pain for those high tech companies to meet their talent need. If OPT or OPT extension is canceled,I do not think these companies would hire more native Americans. What would happen is that they cannot hire enough talents to operate and develop normally any more, which would harm the US economy and eventually every American including those who object OPT and extension so hard today.
