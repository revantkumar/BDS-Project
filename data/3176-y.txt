Sandra McCausland The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program benefits 
only corporation spending at the expense of American college students and citizens with only a high school 
education. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States 
from one year to three years. This would expand the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress 
wages as well as avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign instead of American workers. 
This is too high a cost to lesser educated American workers.
