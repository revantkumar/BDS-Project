Tim Dong As an international student, I highly support the new 24-month extension. 
USA enjoy a long term high reputation in education and technology. 
The end of STEM OPT extension will undermine USA' global competency, which is hard to observe in the short term but instead will show up in the long term. 
Without international students contribution, we may not able to see the emergency of Twitter, Linkedin. We may not see the prosperity of Faceboook, Google and Apple. 
USA is able to lead the world because she keeps absorbing the most talented people worldwide.
If USA government do not want them, Chinese government welcome them.
