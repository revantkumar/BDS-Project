Anonymous I strongly believe that OPT extension should be allowed for International students, the experience they get after completing their OPT period here for 3 years helps them much to understand US culture and makes them comfortable when they go back and work for US clients. Moreover as far as I know if the candidate is not capable enough even after doing Masters and is unemployed for more than 90 days he would not be eligible to be in F1 status anymore. So it is not an extension to all the candidates by default but only for the qualified prospect who have proven themselves at work. So taking away chance from them to live up to their aspirations and force them go back without proper experience is really unjust to them.
