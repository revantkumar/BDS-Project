I went through many comments that were submitted by those who do not support the new proposal. I found their reasoning is they do not want too many illegal immigrants in this country, but I wonder if we, internatonal students, have anything to do with illegal immigrants. Second, they do not want us take over their jobs by accepting lower wage either, but based on labor statistics, the payment international students received are even higher than the mean of the natives in the same industry. To conclude, many of their logics do not make sense, so I do not think their attitude reasonable. I personally firmly support the new proposal.
