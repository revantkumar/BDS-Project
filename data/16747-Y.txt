I support for expanding the training opportunities for F-1 non-immigrant students. It will make the US more competitive in attracting foreign students. Foreign students bring both economy development and cultural prosperity. The tuition fee and living expenses contribute a significant amount of money to the university and surrounding areas. In addition, foreign students greatly enhance the diversity of a university and may facilitate cultural exchange among countries.
