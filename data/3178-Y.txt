I strongly support the OPT extension proposal for the following reason:

The whole U.S education system, especially higher education, benefits a lot from International students. In today's globalized world, when a person decides to study abroad, s/he has many choices in front of her/him, USA, Europe, Japan, Australia... From my personal and friends' experiences, one of the critical factors that makes me and my friends to choose USA as my study destination is the OPT Extension program. It gives you more time to put what you have learned in school to real world and also learn new stuff from practice than its European counterpart universities. This OPT extension creates a perfect and reasonable dynamics between study and practice. 

If the extension is cancelled, the U.S. universities will be less attractive than their competitors in other countries. Many international students may choose other countries rather than America for their oversea study. In this case, the aftermath is not only losing a significant part of the funding from international students' tuition and fees, but more seriously, losing talents from all over the world who would contribute the future of U.S.
