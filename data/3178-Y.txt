Vincent Wang I'm an international student, and I strongly support the proposal for below reasons:
1. The US has been taking leading role in science and technology in past decades, and the most critical reason is that this is a place attractive for both talents and hard working people. International students learn advanced knowledge and skills here, and the STEM extension rule can help them to practice their skills and make contribution to the companies, the communities, and the country.
2. It helps to raise diversity of culture. Employees from different countries think in different ways, and help to make the companies here outstanding from their competitors. This will benefit both the companies and local communities(more tax income).
3. Employers will not hire an international student simply because they are foreigners. Competitions do exist anywhere. However, competitions help the company live longer and grow stronger, so that the company will hire more people. The benefits it brings are far more than damages.
