There is no need for further examination of the F-1 visa program, there has been plenty of study of this already; it is a destructive program that provides employers with cheap labor and gives the foreigner a virtual free greencard, the value of which is in the tens of thousands of dollars.

The program HARMS American college students and destroys the careers of older American workers.

There is also the security issue in play; why are we offering sensitive jobs to those with no allegiance to America?

It is obscene that "our" government is complicit in this ugly scheme.
