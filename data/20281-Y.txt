As an international student, I strongly support this new proposal. The worry that this expansion may reduce job opportunities for Americans is narrow and unnecessary. In my cohort in machine learning, I see many competitive American students and international students.They have equal opportunities to compete for good jobs. Moreover, encouraging talented international students to work and make contribution to the US economy is more likely to improve Americans' life and create job opportunities than to harm anyone.
