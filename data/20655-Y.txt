Instead of blaming the OPT students for taking jobs from American citizen, it is more important to ask: why do companies choose to hire the OPT students?
I just got hired by a Forbes 500 company in STEM. My future boss told me that it took so long to find a perfect fit for the position. They did hesitate due to my VISA status and OPT concern before giving me the offer but it was clear that they made the decision after weighing every aspects.
One thing to keep in mind that OPT students only have three months to find a job in US. If they fail to get employed in the first three month of OPT, they have to leave the US. Three month is a very short time for job hunting and those who succeed must be of great merit to the employer. For the employers, they definitely want to keep their employee as long as possible instead of being forced spending money again on finding a new guy after the OPT 12-month. So the 24-month OPT extension would benefit both the employers and the employees.
I believe a wise company would consider every aspect before they hire an OPT student. Those OPT students who get hired have already proven their value to the company as well as to the country. They deserve an opportunity to work longer in the US to contribute more to the prosper of the country.
