Scott Briles How will new rule aid in mitigating the discrimination against female ID workers that currently exist in the the California/San Francisco Area? Female IT workers are the ones most adversely affected career wise when a couple decides to start a family. Reentry into the profession is nearly impossible after a female IT worker has taken a minimal (minimal, compared to 1st world countries in Europe) maternity leave from work! Also how does this rule support older Americans seeking to reenter the work force after they have taken leave to care for elder relatives?
