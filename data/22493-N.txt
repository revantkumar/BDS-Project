OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013.
OPT removed $4 billion dollars from Social Security and Medicare trust funds.
The original purpose was to give foreign students extra tools to help home countries when they returned but today it is often used by foreign students as a way to stay in the US and by employers to get around the H-1B cap.

When foreign students are hired they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. This costs Social Security about $1 billion a year.

We need to be helping out of work Americans!! This program needs to be stopped.
