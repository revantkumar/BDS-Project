I totally support this new policy. And here are my reasons.

(1) Some people said that this policy would increase more Americans losing jobs. But the fact is this policy would only make American company get the most right people, which would result in more innovation and improvement for these company. The more money these company make, the more jobs they provide for the society, the more tax the government earned, and the stronger the country is. So I don't think the new policy have anything to do with lost job, but it will make more opportunity and make more people in America to be hired. And according to the rate between Americans and foreigners, I think most of these jobs would be got by Americans which would help more Americans to be hired.

(2) Science, technology, engineering and math, all of these three majors are the core for a company to improvement and development. At the same time, it is also the core for a country to be stronger. But above all, they are the core for the society to be better and better. Most foreigners from some countries which don't have a very good working environment may lose the passion for these majors. I think this is lost for the human being. Maybe he is next Newton. 

(3) I think there are a lot startup company in America. And most of them can't sponsor H1-B. Because of this reason, most international students decide to work for big company and this is really bad for startup company to survive. But if the students know that they have 3 years OPT and there have no concern to go startup company, they would have more choice. And startup would have more chance to hire these people and get more chance to survive.
