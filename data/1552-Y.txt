I think that extending the OPT for F1 students is a great step. It comes as a huge relief for all STEM students who come to the US in search of establishing a career that they had always dreamt of. In my opinion, what would be more complete is to allow students with MS or PhD from accredited US universities to obtain an h1-B at the end of their OPT, i.e. without having to go through the lottery. 

Including F1 students in the h1-B lottery comes at a heavy price because every year, the number of students coming in increases, which increases the number of applicants for the lottery. This hurts chances of obtaining an h1-B after investing a lot of time and money.

I strongly feel that it will add strength to the US economy as well to not lose well trained and skilled workers/entrepreneurs.
