Keeping STEM degrees' OPT extension is essential. This proposal is definitely beneficial to our country. International students are a great asset for our economy. STEM students, who are either skilled scientists or mathematicians, would not rob away any job from domestic students, but rather they can help many technology/financial companies to grow. The growth of economy will for sure lead to improved employment in the near future. People will only benefit from this proposal.

The biased opinion that allowing foreign students to work in United States will kill domestic students' opportunities is absurd. Apparently with more skilled workers and talented/well-educated students, a large number of firms and industries would benefit, both in the short and long term. Those foreign students who has exceptional skills will eventually push for economic development and create more job opportunities for the US citizens. As a well-developed country, US especially needs to maintain its growth in the long term. Rejecting talented students who eagers to apply what they have learned at school in certain positions is unwise. And sometimes, our domestic students wouldn't even be willing to take certain positions, or they may not really have the skill sets to succeed in those jobs. I firmly believe that with an extra 24-month extension, our citizens wouldn't be affected negatively at all. On the other hand, we are not only helping firms to grow, but also pushing economic development and creating more job opportunities in the future.

I strongly support such a great proposal. Be open. It never hurts to have more work force to support our economic development.
