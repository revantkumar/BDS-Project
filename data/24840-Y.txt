I strongly support this proposal. It is benefit to the US and foreign student. The US was established based on the immigration trandition that makes the US #1 in the world and therefore should be kept. The talented foreign students will practice more after their graduation if extend the OPT period. They either stay in US or go back to their original country. If stay, they directly contribute to the US more effectively due the extended OPT practice. If they go back to their own country, their experience may stimulate the US to make greater progress. To sum, I support this STEM OPT extension!
