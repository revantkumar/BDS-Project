I support to enlonger the time of Opt for international students.
First, international students are some excellent people from all over the world. Thus if they can work in America, they will definitely learn more and devote more to the company that they are working for.
Secondly, everyone is the same no matter what color of their skin what languages they speak! This, we need the same right to compete with people no matter where we are ! 
Thirdly, I do not know why American against international students to work in their country. If they have knowledge and if they are excellent enough so why they are afraid and why they do not think they can win when applying job and competing with people from all over the world!
Fourthly, if you do not give us the right to work why you request such a big amount of money for tuition fee! Do not you think that there would be less people interest in your country for studying!?
We need longer opt!!!
