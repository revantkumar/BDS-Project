I strongly support this proposal because the diversity from STEM immigrants makes the atmosphere for pursing science and technology very open and comprehensive. Those incentives are irreplaceable. STEM students are the valuable resource that contributes to keep the American society being at the top tier countries in the world in terms of science and technology. I cannot imagine how great the lost we will have if we refused to provide a better opportunity to those students. They did a great job now and before, and they deserve a better opportunity that allow them to do even better to contribute to the USA.
