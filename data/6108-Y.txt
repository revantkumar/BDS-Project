Greg Schneider American STEM workers are losintg jobs/opportunities due to the overstay of HB-1 foreign students who overstay their visas instead of leaving after they have completed their coursework. Now, on top of that, the Obama Administration wants to grant them the extension of 39 months, which adds two more years onto the stay which had already been extended by the previous Bush Admin.

Sincerely,
