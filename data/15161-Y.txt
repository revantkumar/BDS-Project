This is a wonderful initiative by the government. United States prides higher education resources to the world. A lot of the research grants have been spent to support to STEM students. It will be good to let them continue to contribute to US society after their graduation. I completely support this decision of expanding the OPT extension to 24 months. This will be benefit to the sustainability of higher education system and development of US society. Hence, I am hopeful of this decision to get approved.
