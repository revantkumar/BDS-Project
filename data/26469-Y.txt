I strongly support the extension of OPT for F-1 non-immigrant students. I think the extension can bring both USA and USA citizens lots of benefits. The detail reasons can be listed as following:
1) Almost all of the STEM students master at least one important skill which can make a large contribution to American economy. They usually spend 2 to 5 years to do research in their major field and have the capability to behave better than the uneducated one.
2) If the OPT extension is canceled, millions of F1 student will go back to their home country without other choices. In this way, american government has spent lots of education resources on the students who will contribute to other countries.
3) American is a country based on diversity culture. Due to this, it has become a great country that extract creative people from all over the world. The cancellation of OPT extension is somehow a signal to non-immigrant students that they are not welcomed by this country. This signal may reduce the number of foreign students a lot as they are afraid that they can't achieve their dream in this country. 
4) The F1 student may create more job opportunities in America rather than grab the opportunities for the citizens. For example, more students means more consumption. From restaurant, airline company to fashion industry are all benefit from non-immigrant student.
