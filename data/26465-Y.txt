I am currently on F-1 OPT and working in Medicare.
I am a researcher at San Francisco VA Medical Center.
My OPT will end by Sept. 2016 and this will cause me to lose my visa status in the US.
My main task to work on heart aneurysm and my research will help millions of people specially the Veterans who have served this country.
I will be at the peak of my research by Sept 2016 and losing my status will lead to missing valuable medical research.
I am sure there are thousands of talented people who are working in different fields and areas to help USA be the most developed country in the world and the majority of them are in STEM majors.
With the OPT extension, these people will find better chances to contribute to the improvement and progress of this country and can prove their abilities.
I would like to strongly support the new rule on extending the OPT for 24 months.
I appreciate your consideration.
Best Regards,
Hessm Moghaddam, Ph.D.
