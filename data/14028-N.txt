There are so many things wrong with this regulation its hard to know where to start. I'll keep it short to ensure it will be read!!!

The H1B VISA program is OUT OF CONTROL and should be immediately shutdown! To many rules to circumvent the original program. IE, if you work for a university or non-profit research company you are EXEMPT from the QUOTA!! If you are a J1 VISA physician who has obtained a J-Visa waiver under the state 30 program... EXEMPT FROM QUOTA!!!

OPT removed $4 BILLION from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds:

AMERICAN TAXPAYERS pay into this system for retirement. Who gives the authority for removing this from this system and placing it into a program to hire foreign workers over citizens!!! This is so wrong!!!!! I know this program didn't just come into being and our government/businesses other than you have brought this forward and increasing the numbers.

I would debate that anyone with a 4 year degree needing practical training as suggested. That is supposed to be the purpose of the 4 years of school!!! Should be work ready after an orientation!!! 

The reasons for this is businesses save money and paying taxes in to SS and medicare by hiring these recent student GRADUATES over citizens. They also are given money for this program in addition to lower pay for these new workers. WIN/WIN for Business...

This revamped program is just another way for the LIBERAL ADMINISTRATION of OBAMA to bypass the laws and constitution of this country. My question to this administration is: WHY ARE YOU SO INTENT UPON DESTROYING AND WEAKENING THIS COUNTRY YOU WERE RAISED AND EDUCATED IN???

We have serious employment problems in this country and we're taking away jobs that should be filled by American CITIZENS at TAXPAYER expense pulling from the retirement system???? CAN YOU SAY, from ED HEWITT " NOT NO!!! HELL NO!!!!

I would add attachments but they wouldn't be read!!!
