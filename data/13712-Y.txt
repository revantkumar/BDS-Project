I'm a usc current international student. The reason I choose U.S. institute over other famous institute is the the high quality of education along with opt policy, which makes us to practice what we learned from school. If there's no opt, U.S university will be less atrractive and there will be less international students come over here to study. Opt policy would help me enhance professional skill and pay for the loan. When I applied for usc, I didn't excepted to leave us without any work experience, I think other students would be upset either.
