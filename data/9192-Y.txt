Lucia Chen This proposal is GREAT for America. First, it is good to have these talented international students with high degree and skills to work for U.S. companies such as the IT. We need their expertise for these companies to be more competitive all around the world. Second, it's good for U.S. education business, cause OPT STEM extension attracts foreigners to come to U.S., paying quite a lot for tuition and living, offering a lot of jobs for U.S. citizens working in and around universities. Half of the PhDs and postdocs in STEM are international students, they received high education, but doing cheap labors in labs, with the hope of accomplishing their American dream. Without a longer OPT, the population of these people will reduce by a lot and it will be a dramatic loss for the U.S. education and research business.
