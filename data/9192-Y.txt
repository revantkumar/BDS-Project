I strongly support this proposition not only because it benefits the international students, but also because it will bring great advantages to the US economy.
The extension of training opportunities is a great way for international students to apply the skills that they learned here to boost the US economy. This will greatly improve the attractiveness of US colleges to international students. Most international students pay their tuition by their own means, therefore this is a great way to support US superior education. In addition, having these talents working in the US after their graduation will also help US economy to thrive.
Providing these international students with more training opportunities is by no means harming the job opportunities for US citizens. Since the US employers are by law required to first hire US citizens if they meet the qualifications, the fact that these international students are hired shows that they are just filling job vacancies that Americans do not want. 
Why not giving more equal chances to these talented students if they are not so called "stealing jobs from Americans" and they are instead helping boost US economy?
