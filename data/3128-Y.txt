I support this proposal, and I think that similar extensions should be available to students with other degrees as well.
The U.S. is known to be a country of immigrants and a country built by immigrants. Down the line of history, the U.S. had attract countless number of talented people to come, and they had contributed greatly to the development of the U.S.A. Albeit Einstein is one of the best examples of these talented immigrants. 
In order for the U.S. and U.S. higher educational institutions to continue to attract talented students from around the world to come, it is important to show them that the U.S. cares about them, not just their tuition money. Therefore, this extension for STEM students is necessary for the good of the U.S. and international students who have big dreams. I am also arguing that similar measures should be proposed for students with all other degrees because talents are not and should not be limited to STEM.
