Richard Loveday Earlier this year, the Obama Administration announced that it was expanding a little-known program called "Optional Practical Training" (OPT). OPT allows foreign students who hold an F-1 student visa to work for up to 12 months in a job that's related to their field of study. But the Obama Administration wants to expand it to 36 months for foreign students pursuing degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). There are more than enough American STEM students looking for jobs that they shouldn't have to vie with the F-1 students/graduates for the openings.
Even the current OPT program has NEVER BEEN AUTHORIZED BY CONGRESS. Under current immigration law, F-1 visa holders are NOT ALLOWED to hold a job after graduation, and they promise to leave within 60 days of completing their coursework.
But Pres. George H.W. Bush defied the law in 1992 to create the OPT program. Pres. George W. Bush expanded it to 29 months for STEM students. The Obama extension takes that extension even further.
So three Presidents from two Parties have GONE AROUND CONGRESS to take good jobs out of reach of American college graduates. Isn't it time to tell both political establishments to stop? When are the primary political parties going to start taking watching out for Americans & stop pandering to visa holders & illegal aliens?
