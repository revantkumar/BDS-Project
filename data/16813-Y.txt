I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1.International students choose to study in U.S instead of Other counties because U.S is famous for its fairness and openness to talent people. We trust if you study hard and work hard here to improve the society then we can get the chance. If we donot, then thousands or even billions of future students like me will not take U.S as a good choice for advanced study.

2. Many science projects are about 3 years, one years OPT is not enough for even one single project. They need more time to finish those projects without too many changes for employee. Those scientific or technological companies do help a lot for US's economy. Without their steady development and growth, then no steady life in U.S too.
