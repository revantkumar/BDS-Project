I oppose this OPT extension rule because it simply do favor to the international students, especially those from China and India. Chinese and Indian students flooded in our country to rob our job because they do not have such good opportunities in their own corrupted countries. We should not let them take this advantage and should drive those filth out of our nation immediately!!
