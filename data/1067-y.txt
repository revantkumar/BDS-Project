CJeanne Deutsch-Schmidt The work around to allow foreigners to remain in US longer is merely another government attack on American citizens by furthering unemployment for us, and reducing American wages even more! 
It is another promotion of lower wages for big business while disregarding the American worker and our needs! 
Please don't penalize your fellow citizens by bypassing what's in the best interest of Americans so big business can further it's big purse. This MUST not be approved!
