I strongly SUPPORT the proposal, because 
first, the US government should provide more opportunity to allow foreign students who has received US education to contribute to US companies. There are so many excellent foreign students who received excellent US education, and it is really a waste of US education resource if their knowledge are not used toward to US economy or research intelligence growth. The expanding training opportunity is beneficial to so many US companies, that are struggling finding the suitable candidates.

Diversity is really important for companies and researches. People from different backgrounds are able to expand the usability of the products to different cultural backgrounds, bringing the product to the world-wide market. 

I really think we should provide more support to these students, enabling them to success in US and at the same time, enabling America to remain the leading role in technology and intellectual properties in the world.
