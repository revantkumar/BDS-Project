STEM Degreed students have developed special and useful skills/techniques that will help US economy/living standard boost in the future. However, it's not that easy for them to find a job perfectly leverage their knowledge. The requirement from the market might not align with the interest/potential gains of the US as a country. For example, how many theoretical physicists are needed every year by national labs/universities? Not so many. But the fundamental changes that physics might bring to human's life is invaluable. And those changes are brought about by physicists. This is an example but we can easily apply this to mathematicians, biologists, chemists, etc. So really 24 months for STEM degreed opt are a nice way to retain those intellectuals in the US. Please consider having it for the benefits of the US.
