I strongly support this proposal of 24-month extension to STEM OPT. Recent years, skilled immigrants have made great impacts on the U.S. They graduated from u.s. universities and should have opportunities and enough time to use what they learned to contribute to the society. As the growth of IT industries these years, it involves millions of immigrants efforts to make this happen. Also, this extension would not impact non STEM students as OPT students are required to work in a field that is related. To their majors.
