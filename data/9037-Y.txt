Q A I have lived in the U.S. for 6 years both as an F-1 student and full-time employee. I graduated with multiple awards and honors from the top U.S. university. I am on my STEM extension and I paid $60000 in tax last year. Ask yourself if you have paid that much annual tax to America. If you have not, please stop using tax as an excuse for your incompetency. I am contributing to America. You, unemployed, are living off social security. Many high-tech companies have open positions. If you or your children are qualified, please apply. If you are rejected, you should go back and train yourself. Accept your incompetency. Work hard to re-train yourselves. Your life will be better. The jobs are there but they are not yours by default. There is nothing unfair here. Indeed, you are given the first priority. STEM foreign graduates like me get the second consideration. Shame on you. 

My apology to other native supporters of OPT program. I just feel frustrated going through the xenophobic comments that are just so ill-informed.
