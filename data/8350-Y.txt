The STEM students have made huge contributions during the past few years. The work they do are mostly the technical/fundamental part, which is different from the work that the majority US citizens are interested in. The skilled immigrants made great contributions to the fast innovation and development of the US STEM area. I definitely agree with this proposal. It is my firm belief that immigrants need to be given the time and opportunity in America to give back what they have learned at school and improve the living standard of US. I strongly support OPT extension.
