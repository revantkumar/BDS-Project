I believe OPT extension for STEM students is beneficial to both the United States and the students. I am in favour of the new rules.
USA strives to be at the pinnacle of technology which is a key driving force behind innovation and growth. The STEM students are highly skilled individuals with knowledge of the latest in their fields. Providing the right opportunity to grow their knowledge is vital after education and STEM OPT extension helps towards this. 
Given the paradigm of start ups and quick innovations, it will be vital keep the talent pool which is available rather than train new staff on a regular basis. 
The American education system attracts the brightest students from all over the globe. It only makes logical sense to use these minds for the betterment the country.
