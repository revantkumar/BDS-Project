raghuram reddy gade I strongly recommend and support this rule, of extending STEM OPT to 17 or 24 months. This could benefit the students to have more opportunities in-terms of JOBS and also enough time to acquire H1 visa. This could also benefit the country's economy by taxes and revenue from those JOBS.
