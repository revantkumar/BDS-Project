Hi, 
I am just a normal STEM student from North Dakota State University. I had spent 5 years in America to study the software related courses. I thought here, in the America, I can learn the most advanced software related technology. And nowadays, english is not the big problem any more. We could talk with each other fluently. I have lots of American friends which told me that they like Chinese food and culture very much. They would like to play with us and share each other's culture. It seems like we can learn something from each other. After that I also wanted to have a software job in America. Why I say that. Because in those 5 years, what I saw, what I heard, what I did, are all I like. It is make me really feel I am in a freedom country. Therefore, I think to extend the OPT is a very necessary action. It is not only give us the opportunities to stay here longer for our bright future but also give both Chinese and U.S. the opportunity to gain the best from each other.
