I am strongly in favor of this extension. Competition exists, but is far from that crippling as suggested by some posts below. The downside of not supporting this ruling is stated CLEARLY in the DHS proposal: "Canada also recognizes that educational institutions need international students to compete in the "global race for research talent.....". Currently, the MOST talented STEM graduates all over the world is working in the US. Please keep this the states quo to uphold the greatness of this country. Let not some ill-directed bigotry lead us on a wrong path.
