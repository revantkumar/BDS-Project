I believe that the big tech companies would do anything at this point to get their cheaper, indentured foreign labor. Now, the Obama administration tries to circumvent the law again and expand the (never voted on by congress) OPT program? This must NOT be allowed to happen. We graduate twice the amount of Americans with STEM degrees than we have jobs available for them. We do NOT need cheaper foreign STEM workers. I know that congress has received very persuasive testimony from the erudite professors Ron Hira of Howard University and Hal Salzman of Rutgers University, who have clearly stated that the abuse of these foreign visas has displaced a large pool of very bright and talented American STEM workers. These American STEM graduates are over-leveraged with massive student debt, made worse so by the historic record amounts of foreign students who pay full tuition rates in many cases in state tax subsidized schools. That is unfair right from the get go. 
Furthermore, the OPT program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.
Now, American citizens and American tech workers alike are watching very closely to your ruling on this issue and we urge you to rule in favor of the increasingly oppressed and marginalized American citizen STEM worker. No to expansion of the OPT program. NO.
