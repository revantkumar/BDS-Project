I strongly SUPPORT this new OPT extension rule.

First of all, I'm an international Electrical Engineering master student from China and was a image processing engineer intern at VSCO. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my master degree in US, Canada, Singapore. But finally I decided to go to USC is because I noticed that after my graduation I would get a 12+17 months industry training. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. BTW, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. 

Then I think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program. Based on my previous work experience at VSCO, most large research/software development projects would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion.

At last, since I'm a Chinese STEM student and was born and living there, I love my country very much, and I believe that the economics of China will definitely bloom in the future. I would return back China eventually, not only because of my trust about China but also my family is there. Before then, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech industry development. If I have about 3 years work experience in US, I would be competitive in the job market in China. That's why this new OPT rule would benefit both US high-tech industry and international STEM talents.

Hope more people support this good rule!
