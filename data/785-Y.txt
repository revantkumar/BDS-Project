I agree to extend the OPT period of STEM majors. As an international student, we spend more on education in Untied States, and we work harder in University and got the degree. We have more limitations on job seeking. We want to distribute our talents in the work. We want to practice what we learned in the real world. We experience the unfair in job seeking, as 90% employers don't want to sponsor the work visa in Untied States. I think it is fair to extend the OPT so we can have a longer time to work in Untied States. United States a country attract the talents from all over the world. The foreigners will bring diversified cultures, fresh ideas, and more creatives to American company. If the government say no to the international students, the government just say no to the people who can change this world in the future. I believe the international students with high-level education will add more competitiveness. And position competition will help society to progress. 

I agree to extend the OPT period of STEM majors, because I believe it will bring more positive effects to society.
