Depending on personal experiences and beliefs, I strongly support the proposal of 24-month STEM OPT extension.

I'm working as a data analyst in a consulting company in NJ. 

Our clients are composed of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies and hospitals.

In my company, more than half of employees are hired based on nonimmigrant students.
This is because for those master-degree holders in statistics, economics or related field, most of them are coming from countries other than America. 

We are working hard and dedicated to helping our clients understand the key patterns and trends in their data in order to help drive their business.

We believe that analytics can help hospitals to gain competitive edge by understanding the data to get to the right answer.

And what we did should be pretty beneficial to the American health care system.

Based on the reasons listed above, please approve the 24-month STEM OPT extension and implement it as soon as possible.
