How about remembering that there are Americans already ready to step into these fields and are unemployed, in fact well 
over two million of them. How about stop trying to import foreigners into our country to take these jobs.
Bringing in more foreign workers does nothing but punish Americans that are already qualified to do these jobs and 
discourage those who want to get degrees in the future for these jobs. Stop allowing these big companies to demand 
that you push Americans aside for foreign workers that will take away opportunities and hope for their future right here 
in their own country.
