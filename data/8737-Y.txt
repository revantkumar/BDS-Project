I totally support this regulation. I just don't understand why America, as a country which claims to own freedom, equality, and opportunities, always "tries its best" to deprive others from seeking possibilities and success without any justifiable reasons. It's not those international students' fault that you are unemployed. If you are excellent enough, you will not have this kind of problem. Instead of blaming your life on innocent people, try to enhance your own wellbeing.
