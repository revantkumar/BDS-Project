I strongly SUPPORT the new OPT extension rules. 

I disagree with the opinion of some people that this rule will harm US citizens or the job market. As we know that this extension program is only for college students with STEM majors. This actually satisfies the need of job market since STEM majors people are highly in demand today. This program does promote the competition of job market, but instead of causing something negative, it leads to a higher quality of US employees.

Currently F1 students have 17 months extension, which means they have 2 or 3 chances in total to get H1 visa during OPT period. However, for US companies who employ these STEM students, it is absolutely a huge lost that they may lose these people whom they have trained. If the extension could be extended to 24 months, at least the companies will have more time to hire these skilled people and it will be more possible for them to get H1 visa to continue contributing to the companies, as well as the US country.

Overall, it is beneficial to extend the rule to 24 months. If the extension is revoked in Feb, US will lose a huge amount of people in STEM fields, and also might affect potential international students planning to come to US for college study.
