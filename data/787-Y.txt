Ki Woong Kang The OPT STEM extension program has helped me continue working when my H1-B petition was not selected in April. Despite my having a legitimate degree and job in the US, it is still very difficult for me to win the H1-B lottery, which is why this OPT extension program is critical to retain talent in the US. I strongly support the revised legislature, and hope that it passes so that future generations of intelligent and qualified international employees can continue to contribute to the American society.
