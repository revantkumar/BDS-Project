Daniel Nappi Hi ,
I'm very happy to see my international colleagues are allowed to stay in the USA and get practical trainining which helps both my friends and our country.
They work for the growth of our country and they don't even think that they are in another country. They fee US as their homeland .
So,I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors.
