This rule is very much required to keep the American economy in good shape. I dont realize why people are saying it will bring down the wages for American workers. It does NOT! Just see the average salaries being payed in Bay area California and you will realize how wrong the assumption is. Also yes there is the other fear of losing out jobs to immigrants. Any sane person who has done his research can easily see that the demand for IT workers is so high that even if you hire all available American population and all available immigrant workers you cant satisfy the demand.
By rejecting this rule you will just be supporting off-shoring of jobs. Companies wont think twice to move the jobs to other locations where labor is cheap and skilled resources are plenty.
Students who came on F1 Visa to this country have invested their skills and resources in making this country great. Please keep it that way.

I wholeheartedly support and welcome this move.
