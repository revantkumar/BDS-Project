I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

First, students who learned knowledge and receive education from the United States ought to stay in the U.S. and make contributions to the U.S.. The government should not set more barriers for the own good of U.S..

Second, diversity is a fundamental characteristic of U.S. society. A large number of international students have the potential to make significant contributions. 

Last but not least, competition is not a bad thing for the society. Competition does exist, but it is competition that help pick out those who are more capable, that improve the average level of students and workers, and that contribute to the global competitiveness of the United States. Instead of claiming jobs from U.S. citizens, international students compensate for the lack of local labor in certain fields (e.g. STEM). It's not only an opportunity for international students, but also an advantage for the U.S..
