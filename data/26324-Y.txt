I strongly support this policy. It is short-sighted to opposite the OPT extension, the policy definitely benefits America in the long run. 
First, the well-educated workforce can contribute to the economics of America. Americans should not be afraid of competitions. The struggle and competition makes America a great nation. If those talents come back to their own countries and use their knowledge learned in the U.S. to develop their own countries, that is what so called 'horrible'. Then America will gradually losing the leading position in the world. 
Second, U.S. employers will benefit from the increased ability to rely on the skills acquired by STEM OPT students while studying in the United States, as well as their knowledge of markets in their home countries. They pay rents, they buy staff, they travel, which all contribute to the economics. 
Last but most important, the U.S. is an immigrant country. For the hundreds of years, millions of people from all over the world came to America, settled down in this country and lived their lives here. There efforts make the U.S. a strong nation.
