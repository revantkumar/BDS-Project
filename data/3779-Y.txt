The vast range of backgrounds and experiences of immigrants have made America a melting pot for more than 200 years. For the ones who claim for citizens' rights, please trace back your family tree and see how many generations passed since your ancestors came to this country. This country is made of immigrants and their descendants, improving and expanding the OPT policy would help and keep the U.S. its place as the greatest nation on earth.
