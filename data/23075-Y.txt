Expanding OPT is a good way for American high-tech companies to hire more employees easier. A great amount of F-1 students who haven't get H1B have to go back to their countries if this rule be canceled, which means the companies paying a lot to for the training during the internship couldn't get the return they except to. That will lead to a situation that the companies averse hire international employees in the future. The difficulty of finding a job will make more F-1 students tend to back to their own countriesthey can't get the official jobs because of H1B so they don't want to waste 1 year in the USA. Then more and more high-tech companies unable to hire enough employees to support operation, and they may have to close down in some years later. It is not a good thing for the USA to lose high-tech companies. Give more opportunity to F-1 students, get more choices for America.
