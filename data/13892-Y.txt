I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the reasons below:

1. U.S. government should give students learned knowledge and skills in U.S. universities opportunities to stay and make contributions to the U.S. economy.

2. The competition from international students can improve the talents selection in U.S. and make the whole U.S. more competitive still.

3. Diversity is one of the most important elements of U.S.. A lot of well known experts in various fields were international students before that.
