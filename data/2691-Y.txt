It's absolutely a great way to keep more talents in the U.S. We don't want to lose those people with high education, they can contribute more for the new technology field and others. If those students with high education cannot stay in the U.S. It would be a huge damage for those new technology companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon. They will lose all the international talents and cannot find enough labor force in U.S citizens. So I am definalry agree with this proposal.
