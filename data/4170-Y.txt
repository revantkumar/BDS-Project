Yes! I support the opt-extension. I believe OPT-extension would be in the best interest of our nation.

Foreign tech workers contributed tremendous growth to the US economy. If US lose this force, USA loses a large portion of growth that the foreign workers bring about. 

Without policies like OPT-extension, it would just be a matter of time before US lost the best STEM students it trains using the money from the taxpayers. 

The extension policy will make sure the best STEM students stay in US. Usually the one year of training and internship that are currently provided by the OPT visa is not enough for the best STEM students to stand out from the program, meanwhile it is also not enough time for the employer to observe and choose the best fits for their full time jobs. 

In the long term not expanding the training opportunities will greatly damage the competitiveness of US economy, especially in the high tech industry. 

DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN. APPROVE the OPT-extension for students with STEM Degrees.
