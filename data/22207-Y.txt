It is really a great thing for United States. I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:
1. Several of international students, after graduation, they went back to their own countries because of the work authorization problem. 
This stopped them to learn more about United States, they have learned a lot from School and might have a lot of ideas want to apply in United States' industries. After certain years, some of the students might want to go back to their own countries and further cooperate with the people and industries in the united states. This of course will increase the friendship between these countries and United States. 
2. International students really have some advantages, by looking at the IT companies, a lot of previous international students are contributing to the industry and some great creativities are made by them. If we did not approve this policy, United States will lose this great treasure.
