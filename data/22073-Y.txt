I fully support the extension of OPT. Among the STEM international students, quite a lot of them hold advanced degrees. These intelligent people are treasurable to US growth. Their contribution to the high-tech development is important and indispensable. Many against comments mentioned that this proposal will make US citizens have less chance of getting a job. That's absolutely wrong. According the 2015 survey, among the total H1B applicants, only 13% are STEM majors. Revoking STEM OPT extension certainly will not help to increase the job opportunities for US citizens.
