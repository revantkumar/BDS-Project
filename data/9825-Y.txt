Abhishek Sehgal The OPT STEM Extension has been critical in creating a strong technical workforce in the fields it caters to. Over the years the companies have taken a strong advantage of this and the strength of the fields has grown leaps and bounds. It supplies the US with skilled workforce trained in their own universities so that they don't have to rely on acquiring talent from other countries. If this extension is rescinded not only will this affect the incoming batch of talent into the industry but also the ones currently employed under OPT in their respective fields. With a loss of such a huge workforce, these companies would have to scrap existing projects affecting the currently employed workforce as well. And that too at a time when America is picking itself up from a recession and creating greater opportunities. The STEM extension is more important than people give it due credit for. I am all in favour for it.
