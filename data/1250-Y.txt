It is a good act. Some people are against that because they cannot see the big advantage to our nation and education system. Specifically speaking, Enabling continued extended OPT for qualifying students with experience in STEM fields is consistent with DHS's Study in the States initiative, announced after the 2008 IFR in September 2011 to encourage international students to study in the United States. It will make our education system more attractive to international students and more affordable to our own american students.
