I am an international student and pursuing phd degree in US. I absolutely support with this extension. 

First of all, the international students, especially those with masters and PHD degree, bring great contribution to keep the dominance of many science company. for example, there are many international technicians and students working in science-predominant companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon, they contribute their intelligence and passion totally, making American companies much more competitive all over the world. 

Secondly, there are more and more international students, particually those with master or PHD degree, manage to make their own business. Take my roommate Chen for example, he graduated from CMU last year with computer science degree, and now he starts his own computer company in Pittsburgh, and hires many local Americans. So international students might increase the job opportunities rather than compete jobs with local Americans. 

Lastly, the cut of opt extension may bring about a temporary relief, but in long term, it is bad for Americas predominance in many field, especially in high-tech field. What we can imagine is following situation: high-tech foreign employees were exiled to their homeland, as the result, the creativity and the innovation of native American company might decrease, and finally become less competitive in the world. What a could not be ignored fact is that, recently the booming of high-tech and internet companies is the result of there are increasing number of entrepreneurs with foreign advanced degree, most of them with master degree in Computer Science or other engineering related field. So, by cut the extension OPT, the America government are exiling their innovators and job creators.
