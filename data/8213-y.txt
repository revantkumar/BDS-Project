Bing Cui I strongly support the new rules for the following reasons
1. OPT program is a selling point of US education. Many of the foreign students decided to come to US instread of going to Europe or Australia because they expect bothe theoritical and professional training.
2. Foreign students are not taking job opportunities away from American citizens. They are filling the gap in the job market and give US companies a second chance when they couldn't find qualified candidates.
