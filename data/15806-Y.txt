I totally support this proposed rule for the following reasons:

This is not a rule aiming to take jobs away from US citizens, neither is this a rule a free-pass for foreign students to get a job in the US. As a job candidate, foreign students would only benefit from this rule so that the companies can legally hire them. The students still have to be outstanding enough to get the job offer. 

As suggested by its name, OPT is part of the training for students specializing in majors closely related to working experience. This proposed improvement of OPT would greatly enhance each eligible foreign student's study experience in the US, allowing them to focus more on theory stuff in the school knowing there would be a chance of practical training awaiting them after they graduate. As a result, a more well-rounded student with in-depth knowledge in both theory and skill perspective is growing out of such program. Not only the company looking for talented employees would benefit from such outcome, but also the US government, by culturing thus attracting more and more young yet brilliant minds. 

From the side of the companies looking for fresh blood, an expanded candidate pool would be the best they are hoping for. I think the only thing a good company should look for when hiring, is competence and diligence. This proposed rule merely opens a door for these companies to be able to look into a larger crowd for the best candidate, making it possible for them to acquire the most brilliant minds in the world thus maintaining their role as internationally leading companies. 

All in all, this proposed rule would only make US a better job market with healthy competition that drives every job candidate (both local citizens and foreigners) to study harder to become a more competent employee. And on the other side, employers and US government would benefit from a diverse talent pool.
