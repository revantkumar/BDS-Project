I support this proposal since it will be helpful for the development of American economy.
1. Longer OPT extension will provide F-1 students more time to contribute what they have learned to US society. 
2. There are many technical company in US hiring talented OPT students. Cancel OPT extension will dramatically damage these companies and US economy.
3. Some people may worried about working opportunities for Americans since F-1 students can be competitive in job searching. However, only competitive environment encourages improvements. Good working opportunities will attract more creative and intelligent students to work for US and urge native American workers to work hard in the meanwhile. A company with only Americans is a nightmare.
