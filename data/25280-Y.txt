After reviewing the whole proposed OPT regulation, I personally strongly support this new Rule. From F-1 Students' perspective, it provides more opportunities and time for them to apply their professional skills into corresponding industrial field and make more contributions to Unite States High Tech Companies as well as to the whole nation. From the Government's perspective, more talented young graduates would be able to stay in the nation to promote economic development and technology innovation.
