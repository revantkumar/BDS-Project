There is no doubt that this is a good proposal. 
Nowadays Internet and Information Technology are involved in every aspect of every industry. The current situation is that most of the employees in the IT industry or sector are contributing and devoting their time, efforts and life to IT development of United States with an OPT or OPT-extension. If there is no effective solutions to guarantee their right to stay in US, the IT industry in America would witness a large loss and fluctuation. 
So this proposal is reasonable, and it is good for America's economy, society and long-term development.
