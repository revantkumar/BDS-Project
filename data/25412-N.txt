The proposed changes in the OPT would be VERY BAD for American workers, who should be given PRIORITY OVER foreign workers. Too many Americans are ALREADY OUT OF WORK and have the qualifications to fulfill the needed jobs.

Why does the Obama Administration CARE SO LITTLE FOR AMERICAN WORKERS? Further, this proposed change would reduce funds for Social Security while just giving employers more profit. I am for capitalism, but NOT AT AMERICAN WORKERS' EXPENSE.

Thank you.
