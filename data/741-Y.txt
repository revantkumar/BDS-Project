I strongly support this rule!
For this country's own good, please keep these STEM students otherwise they are going back to our opponents like China and those countries will later take the lead in science and technology. 
I don't think hiring those foreign STEM students will threaten the Americans' own job opportunities. Instead their contributions to the industries and academia may help create more job opportunities in return.
