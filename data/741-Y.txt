Gopi Krishnan The intent of ICEB is right in trying to improve and expand the quality of education provided to OPT STEM students but there may be serious repercussions if such rigorous schemes are implemented. 
A lot of companies today with immense research opportunities and revolutionary ideas are small companies, including start-ups. Thus, the ICEB must ensure that their efforts to make STEM education better shouldn't create a hurdle for the employer. Many international students, including me, are willing to work in small companies and start-ups. 

it must be remembered that the companies have a freedom of choice in recruiting students. Thus, given the large pool of competitive students both local and foreign from various backgrounds, these regulations might deter the industry from hiring OPT STEM students.

Therefore, consider the comments of small and medium companies and ensure that steps are taken to ensure more companies hire STEM students first.
