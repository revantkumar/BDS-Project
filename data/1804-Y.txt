Heather Hoffman I strongly agree with improving and expanding OPT. The major reason is it keeps our economy blooming and on top of world. 

We are country of immigrants. The first British people across the sea to settle this country, German scientists in world war II including Einstein, and John von Neumann, or today's entrepreneur including Elon Mask, Satya Nadalla, they have been pushing our country forward. Now imagine, after the elites of their company that travel across the world this far to our country receive the best education in our country and become excellence in engineering and technology, they have to get back to their country because we don't allow them to stay here. Huge loss! The truth is, they are probably not going to consider being here at the first place since they would not be able to stay. 

Nowadays, even with the previous 17 months extension, our top companies still needs to outsource thousands of technical jobs to the world because we are lacking of enough smart people in United States. By extending OPT by 24 months would at least ease on this problem and help our company to continue leading the world.
