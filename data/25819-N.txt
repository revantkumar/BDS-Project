The proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program, which gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students over Americans is preposterous. The training of foreign students over American students makes no sense. The Optional Practical Training program also provides up to 27 months of relief from FICA payments from the students and the employers. This is just another Federal program that costs the US Treasury millions of dollars annually and should be eliminated for foreign students. There are a sufficient number of American students that can meet the same criteria for consideration in this program that should pay into FICA with accompanying employer payments.
