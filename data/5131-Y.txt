Jason Rodriguez Hello,

I am a hiring manager in my organisation. I appreciate DHS for working to bring this rule. I support STEM OPT EXTENSION and CAP-GAP RELIEF proposed rule. Everything is all good except the "Mentoring and Training Plan" . It puts unnecessary burden on employers who need to learn how to fill those forms and read up on all the regulations. It will severely affect the amount of time it takes to hire anyone. Companies will have to spend much more resources on legal and administrative things. Please remove this requirement from the final rule.
