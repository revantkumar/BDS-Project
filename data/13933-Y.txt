I strongly support the proposed rule. Being an international student working in USA, I understand the value of time available on STEM extension. Considering we are given H1 visas on lottery basis, it is highly important for us to be given more than just one chance at it. Our entire career depends on that lottery, because if there is no extension and someone does not get selected in that lottery in his first and last attempt, then they will have to go back to their respective countries. If that happens, not only is that bad for the student's future but also for the future of USA, that they're unable to retain intelligent, hard working professionals who can really boost the country's economy. 
Implementing the proposed rule would greatly affect the life of deserving international students in a positive way. We come here to live our dreams.
I read in many comments here that this rule would negatively affect the Americans as it gives more jobs to the international students; this not NOT true. If you're deserving, more capable than your peers, you should and will be rewarded with a job irrespective of your nationality. If I were running a company in America, I would want to hire more talented people in my company for the same amount of money irrespective of whether they were Americans or not, thereby improving my company's profits and in-turn the national economy.
Hence, I strongly support the rule and I believe it should be implemented for the betterment of everyone.
