Hello
With the high unemployment in our Country, the true figures not those published which only reflects those on unemployment, give me a rational explanation as to why you would turn your back on fulfilling the obligations of your elected office.

Your first duty is to the citizens of this United States of America. That includes not only upholding the Constitution but includes the welfare of those who have elected you.

Surely the many youth looking for employment could be better served by not bringing unneeded people from foreign locations.
