Increasing the OPT STEM extension can help students move through the lottery process of H-1B visa application. The current H-1B cap turns a lot of talented students out of US. Some of the students are from MIT, Harvard, and other great schools, and some of them are actually planning to start their own ventures in US. Increasing the OPT STEM extension to 24 months will give students more opportunities to get H-1B visa, and make US better.
