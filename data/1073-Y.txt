Tyler Wood I strongly SUPPORT this proposal. 

U.S. doesn't want to send all good international students back to their home country. International students get better education here. U.S. needs to use them for its own development, not cultivate good students for other countries' development. That's not wise. U.S. Is always the best in the world for everything. It should keep like that by using STEM international students more.

The STEM OPT extension is beneficial of the development of US. So I strongly SUPPORT this proposal.
