Since the OPT students only take the job that american don't want to do. So it is no sense to say that foreigners take the job of American citizen. Also, the OPT attract a lot of students study in America. If the OPT extension is not approved, there will be a great reduction of foreign students thus America will lose the money from China, Indian and other countries.
