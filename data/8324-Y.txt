I strongly support the proposal because of the following reasons,
1. More international students will come to US for further education if the proposal can pass, the tuition they pay and the living expense they spend can make great contributions to the economy here.
2. Most PHD students get funding either from American companies or government. If the OPT is only one year is way too short for training a college graduate to be a qualified engineer/scientist which is waste money.
