Chris Wu I strongly support the OPT STEM extension rule. International students had brought in far more jobs than the number they took. Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers globally and contributed $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2011 (http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf). The contribution from international students working in STEM are very essential for US to continue the leadership in the world. The wage of students in STEM fields are usually much higher than the minimum wage, therefore not affecting the minimum wage at all. Consequently, these students contribute much more tax than average jobs, and those money increased medical and other welfare of American citizens. Losing those STEM professionals by ending the STEM extension rule and therefore send them to other competing countries especially China and India, will be definitely detrimental to the US leadership in the world. To sum up, I think we should absolutely pass this extension rule for US interest.
