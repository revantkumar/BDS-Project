As an international student who studies Computer Science, I think it really matters to have an extended period to legally work in the U.S. Not all international students plan to stay and work for a long term in the U.S. Most of us plan to have hands-on experience in the certain field and go back to their country. This benefits the U.S. since many successful people and a lot of skilled foreign employees are contributing to U.S. economy. Innovation in Silicon Valley has helped creating a lot of employment opportunities especially for those people who are from America.
A strict policy for Non-immigrant students would reduce the innovation in this country and undermine the competitiveness of America.
