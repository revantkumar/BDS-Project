This amend of the F-1 nonimmigrant student visa regulations of OPT would keep United States thriving and prosperous and therefore shall be passed for a sustained growth and the insistence of the core values of the country.

To begin with, International students by no means took away the jobs of American people. The significant loss of jobs result from foreign competitions and outsourcing of manufacturing. The assembly of Apple's Smart Phones, for instance, take place mostly in China. America is losing the jobs in low-pay industries such as labor intensive manufacturing, but not in innovative and high-tech industries, where most STEM students seek their OPT opportunities. In fact, given the depressed manufacturing industry, it is best for America to maintain its leading position in industries that are fuelled by innovations and intellectual progress. By introducing diversity of thoughts, cultures and motives to the workplace, international students contribute dramatically for this cause. On the other hand, expelling all the international students only means an increase in foreign competitions--they could just go back to their own country and contribute to their own countries' development at a even more competitive price.

The failure to pass this amendment is also a failure on the Core American Values of equal opportunities for everyone. International students are already not at the same ground as domestic students regarding the access to resources. OPT is an important opportunities for international students to receive trainings over their courses so that they are more prepared themselves to work in the industry. Stripping of such precious opportunity for international students is unfair for them, compared to the Domestic students who usually have more opportunities in internship and career training, to achieve their personal success through their personal diligence and liberties for them to do so.
