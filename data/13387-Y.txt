I strongly support the proposal and want to comment on Page of 63385 regarding "B. STEM Extension Period for OPT". I fully agree that many projects in STEM fields are very complicated and requires lengthy time frame to advance the frontiers of science and technology. 

I a PhD candidate in Applied Mechanics in Civil Engineering, specializing in damage modeling in composite materials. I pay attention to news in my area and also communicate with other researchers in my area. For instance, this year President Obama announced a composite Manufacturing Innovation Hub [1], The Institute for Advanced Composites Manufacturing Innovation, IACMI [2]. The federal will commit five-year resource to establish multiple centers [3], like manufacturing innovation hub in Knoxville, TN [4], simulation center in Purdue University, et al. For the success of program like these, there is a big demanding in STEM students holding doctor degree and international students are very important workforce. Also it will be very helpful if the 24-month extension is approved, since many projects in this area can be multi-years projects and even with multiple phases. Also I believe in the state there must be many other important programs and they are critical important to keep the United States at leading position of technology.
