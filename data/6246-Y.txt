Darshan Lingaraj I am proud of being a graduate degree holder from one of the best universities in the world. It hurts me to see fellow students and friends leave the U.S after their hard earned degrees because they cannot stay back due to outdated immigration policies. I strongly support the OPT STEM extension policy since it does not in any way affect the U.S working population negatively. In fact, it will help foster an environment of innovation and enterprise, thereby leading to higher job creation in the U.S. This will also allow the U.S to retain smart and dedicated workers who will bring jobs rather than creating them in their own home countries.
