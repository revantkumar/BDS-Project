I had to train my replacement from India. I was working in IT doing Archer System programming. The U.S. employees were replaced by people from India. I know of several skilled IT professionals who had experiences similar to mine who are now unemployed and can't find work. Despite this, the Congress continues to issue large numbers of H1B visas.
