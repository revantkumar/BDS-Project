I am in favor of 24 months STEM Extension. 
Being an F-1 Student, it will be beneficial not only to me but also impact American Economy in a positive manner. In 2013-14 academic year, international students and their families at colleges and universities across the U.S. contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy and supported 340,000 jobs.

we need this rule to be implemented to continue getting the support in the future.It will be a win win situation for both U.S, Economy as well as students. International students like me leave their home countries to make academic and cultural contributions to american society.we are getting global exposure working through our science and engineering coursework.

America is land of opportunities and always supported the people who are hard working and wanted to create an impact. 
I strongly vouch for this rule. 

Thank you.
