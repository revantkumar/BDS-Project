The contribution of International students to US economy is very high as they bring young talents from across the globe to United States. The diversity of employers will be improved considerably and thus new ideas emerge from it. I suggest the F1 students must be given same privileges as that of H1 visa holders or increase STEM OPT extension to 5 years which allows those young talents to work and contribute to US for longer periods. If these students return their countries after gaining immense knowledge from US universities, it's nothing but we are losing a lot and they are gaining lot.
