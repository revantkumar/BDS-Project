Zuqi Shang I strongly support to expand training opportunities for f-1 Nonimmigrant students with STEM Degrees for the following reasons.

Firstly, the students who come to US to study are the most talent people from different countries. They are productive and creative, which can make great contribution to the American company. These company can, therefore, provide better product and service, and then improve the life standard of American.

Secondly, the most important reason that f-1 Nonimmigrant students want to work in American is just to learn and practice there perfessional skills. Most of them want to come back to construct their own country rather than competing with American, especially for the STEM Degrees students.
What's more, as we know, most American do not like the job position STEM students take, such as programming and mathematics.

last but not least, it's American's spirit to give everyone equal chance and admit talent people. This is the reason why the United States is strong!
