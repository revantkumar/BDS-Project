With more and more politicians wanting a higher minimum wage, why would you bring in more non AMERICANS that work for a lower wage? Isn't that counter productive to raising the minimum wage? With so many AMERICANS out of work, wouldn't it make sense to keep the available worker pool as low as possible to force these companies to offer up more money to get a worker? 
When will this house and senate start doing things that benefit AMERICANS? I see what's going on and I can assure you that there are many that see it also.
