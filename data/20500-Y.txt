As a F-1 student in the STEM field, I would love the opportunity to give back to the country that generously hosted me! With the understanding that American citizens should always be given the job first, if there is still shortage, that's when foreign work force can be utilized (pretty much like any other country I've been to). 

F-1 students are here studying. They are either paying very high tuition (with no loans) or contributing with research for the scholarship or grant they have been given. The question for America is: are there other venues where America can benefit more from them during their stay?
