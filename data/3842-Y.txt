After viewing pages of comments, most of the comments that negate this rule change are statements with poor reasoning. They simply blame their jobless status on the fact that other people is more competitive for job positions. 

First thing of all, the situation of the job market is a complicated issue. Cancelling the OPT extension will not help with the situation. The total number of H1B working visa issued is unchanged, which is 85 thousands, this number is extremely small compared to the total number of active jobs in the U.S, which is 150 million according to the D.of.N. And I'm afraid cancelling this policy will further make the situation worse. Canceling OPT means the employers will have a much smaller pool to choose qualified employee from. This will directly affect the economic growth of U.S, whose depression is something that our world cannot risk to face. So by offering opportunities for the more qualified and talented STEM people is actually a vital positive stimulation to the economy and job market. 

U.S. is the single country in this world that truly welcomes the talented, smart and industrious people regardless of their skin, gender and nationality. And this is the exact reason that it is one of the greatest countries ever existed. Shutting foreign people out of the country is the exact opposite of the so called American Spirit and American dream, and I remember that last time a country did this completely screwed itself up and ended up in a over-100-year unsettling war. 

Thus I strongly support this policy.
