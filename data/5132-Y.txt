I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months because we need to give the best and the brightest students every opportunity to succeed in the U.S. The best students of the world come to U.S. in search for a opportunities, to express themselves as to who they are and dream, while also helping the U.S. in becoming the best nation along the way. 

I believe the extension for F1 OPT STEM to 24 months sends out a positive signal and not only motivates the best to come to U.S. but also to stay here and attract even brighter talent from across the world.
