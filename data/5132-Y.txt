Gail Charest I have been a programmer analyst in the technical field for over 30 years now and I've watched my coworkers lose their job bit by bit at a steady rate. Jobs were plentiful in the 90's but has steadily declined since! You need to be disciplined, strategic and organized in this field but most important to a company's growth is loyalty, which a low-paid immigrant will not possess. I am getting close to retirement but what about the younger generation who want to enter this field but don't stand a chance at securing a job in their field of choice. I find it absolutely disgusting how corporate America has single-handedly, with the help of our own government officials, destroyed this wonderful country of ours due to ignorance and pure greed. Who does our government expect to get money from to run this country if they are giving away American jobs to foreigners who don't have to pay taxes?
