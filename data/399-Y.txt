Bill Lin I strongly support this new rule.
If students who are studying in the US all go back to their country after graduate, they will soon create value for their countries that will one day compete with the US companies. Why the US uses its own education to nurture its competitors? The students should stay in US, or at least have the chance to do contribution for US.
