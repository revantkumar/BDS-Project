This proposal is brilliant rule and open-mind. 
All job opportunities are fair and equals to all people. Companies do not care about the citizenship of employees, the only thing they care about is whether employees satisfy their requirements. So, as a US. citizen speaking native language, less limitations during looking for a job and even have more job opportunities (some companies only hire citizens), if you still could not find a job, there is no business of international students.
Only offering job to US. citizens is unfair and are killing more business opportunities that are relied on those international students.
