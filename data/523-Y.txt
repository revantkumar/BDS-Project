I strongly support this proposal and I think OPT-extension would be in the best interest of our nation for the following reasons. First, the U.S. government should keep anyone including international students who major in a STEM subject with a bachelor or even higher degree to stay longer in the country in order to let them fulfill their obligations to contribute to the society. Since the dominating factor for the economic growth in America is technology, instead of refusing talents because of their nationalities, the American government should accept the talented people for the good of both boosting economic development and diversity reasons. If we have tremendous amount of technology talents outflow from the U.S. for the good of those local citizens with lower competitive power, it'll be a loss to our domestic companies and further to the economy of the country. Competitions have the effect of making people work harder and the U.S. citizens nowadays already holding a lot of privileges compared with international students need these competitors not only on self-improvement but also for the good of the whole country. The U.S. history is built on the contributions of immigrants and the friendly immigration policy is the main reason that keeps America strong and thriving. Anyone who has an American dream should have the same right and opportunities including international talents.
