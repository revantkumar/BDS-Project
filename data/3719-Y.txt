I strongly support 24 months stem extension rule
The proposed rule of extension would surely help the STEM students to enhance their 
knowledge in their respective fields
this policy could help them get sufficient talent employees, and create more jobs for 
local people(think about Uber). 

Overall, this policy could help US companies to get more talent employees, and may lead 
to more new companies and more jobs, which benefit local people.
