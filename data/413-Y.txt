I STRONGLY SUPPORT this new opt extension rules. The States doesn't have enough students to do tough job in STEM fields. So international students are good supplement to help us research, work, etc. Due to that, I think this new OPT extension is a good rule for both international students and our country. That's definitely a win-win rule!!
