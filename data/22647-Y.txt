I SUPPORT this proposal as I believe F-1 OPT program has many benefits to not only the US and the World.

Firstly, what are the most important fundamental element of US? It is diversity. In the past 300 years, immigrants from all over world came to this land, brought their knowledge and diligence here making this country one of the best around the world. Today, F-1 OPT program continue service as the most important policy attracting elites from other countries and making the US continue to flourishing. 

Secondly, many students use OPT as an opportunity to gain work experience and when they return to their home country they brought with them the Oecumenical Value, which is critical to the overall benefit of human beings and peace of the world.
