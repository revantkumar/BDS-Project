Some of us might think that reducing the number of foreign STEM students by not giving them work authorization will improve our economy. But I think the issue is more complicated than that. If we don't allow the foreign students to stay here, they are going to go back to our competitors - emerging India, China, or even Canada who are trying to attract foreign talents like US is did before. With the quality of education the international STEM talents receive, it is possible for them to create the next Facebook, Google, or even Tesla in those countries. Moreover it will force our companies to move their operations to China or India because of the STEM talent shortage. As a result a lot of americans will loose their current jobs. We need to understand that we can not retain our leadership in innovation and development if we don't get the best innovators and researchers. We need to keep attracting the biggest brains, otherwise they are going to go back to their home countries or other counties with friendlier immigration policies (e.g. Australia or Canada). Today, many individuals contributing to the STEM fields are the international students with PhD degrees from US universities. It helps to grow our economy and create jobs for all Americans.

But there is one thing I don't support is to give away H1 and L1 visa to foreign nationals without the quality US education. I know that the IT consultancy firms like Infosys or Tata are just bringing cheap labors from foreign countries. The individuals they bring here are not the best and the brightest who can only provide cheap labor. It will only increase unemployment here in the US.

So we should amend our policies to make them friendlier for F-1 students with STEM degrees. At the same time stop giving away visas to individuals with foreign STEM degrees.
