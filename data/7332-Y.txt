Me, all my friends around me and millions of international students support this rule. 

F-1 student has one year working permit after graduation, almost no American employers would like to just hire a good OPT student for one year, this is because F-1 students are higher educated, are well trained and can bring much more benefit to US. If these students learned knowledge and skills but can not apply those to the work here, it is definitely a big loss. This means almost all American employers, who are satisfied with the working performance of our F-1 students and would like to continue working with them, should also support this rule! If almost every employer claims that working opportunity should be equal to everyone who is competent and legal to work, then everyone should be equally treated and considered.
