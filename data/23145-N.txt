As an engineer, I oppose The Optional Practical Training program.
The program is just another trick to bring more low-paid workers into the USA.
Most US companies have already replaced their engineering staff. 
Many engineers in this country are unemployed or working for much less than 10 years ago.
Aso, the claim that US engineers are not as good as foreigners is ridiculous.
