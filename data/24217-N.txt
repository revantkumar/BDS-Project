I am opposed to the expansion of the F-1 program. Even the current OPT program has never been authorized by Congress. Under current immigration law, F-1 visa holders are NOT allowed to hold a job after graduation, and they promise to leave within 60 days of completing their coursework. In my view that makes this program illegal.
Stop trying to bring in foreign workers when we have such high unemployment.
