I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:
1. American culture value equality so much, if America does't give chance to foreign students to work here, then America is not as equal as expected.
2. The reason why America become so powerful is that the most talented people in the world come to US to work and work really hard, so it's good for US economy to have those talented foreign people work in engineering field;
3. From the far sight, Its really important to make some policy to attract students from all over the world to come to America study and work.
