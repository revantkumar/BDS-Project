Yuxuan Zhang One more point to support OPT STEM extension plan:

About some people's point on "OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013". I read the source article from Steven. I highly suspect the number and his analysis to the number. He gave the number without providing any DHS official data and documentation. As well, his analysis based on the number is misleading. He assumed 430,000 jobs denied for citizen worker because there are all together 430,000 OPT 12-month are issued. Note that OPT issue does not guarantee an employment. The issue of OPT is just enable a student to have illegal status as a job seeker. Finding a job is a rough road for them, as I analyzed previously. For my friends nearby, less than half of them finally end up with a job during OPT status. More and more people choose going back to home country as the growing development in economics and technology industry in China, even though their OPTs are issued. This is the real example in top university Columbia. The rate in other universities even much lower. Let's take a look at of the number of 17-month OPT STEM. The ratio is only 14.7% for STEM extensions to 12-month OPTs. It is low as I said, many students going back to home country for careers finally. STEM students are only taking up one part of international students. Though it is not denied a number of them have changed to status to H1B which gives longer time as work status, please note H1B issue amount is greatly reduced by a method of lottery. It means alien amount with long time working status is safely controlled. And thus, OPT or OPT STEM extension is just a temporary status. It should not be blamed for denying jobs for resident workers.
