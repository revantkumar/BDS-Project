Cai Ruicong As a potential international student, I strongly support extending OPT to 24 months. 

The OPT attracts me a lot for it could give me time to work in the US after graduate program. This working experience is especially precious when I go back to China to find a job. So, a short-term OPT is definitely less attractive for me, and I believe many students also think so.

On the other hand, many programs in the companies need international employees spend more than one years, which means a short-term OPT will bring a negative change when their OPT are overdue. As a result, the efficiency and the benefits of the program could be hurt.
