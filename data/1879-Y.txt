The proposed rule for 24 month OPT extension had brought in sigh of relief for students like me who are in F1-OPT and haven't had their H1-B picked up in the lottery.

With the new proposed rule, it gives us a more time and chance to learn, gain more technical knowledge and enhance the skills obtained from Masters' program. In this way the new proposed rule is very much welcoming. 

thanks
