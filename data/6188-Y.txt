I strongly support this new OPT extension rule.

OPT extension is an important factor for me choosing study in U.S, rather than Australia, British or any other countries, even through there are also lots of prestigious Universities. Moreover, when considering life and culture, situation in other countries may even better than U.S. OPT extension is the most important driving force for me, and may also for most of other STEM degrees students study in U.S. OPT bring us a chance combing our knowledge learnt from classes with real life. As we all know, company are willing to recruit people with industry experience, rather than those new graduates. OPT gives us a chance to acquire these experience and further improve us. Moreover, OPT extension is important. For these project related to knowledge of STEM, It supported by numerous of calculations and experiments, which can hardly be completely finished within less than one year. We need longer time to finish a industry project. Therefore, OPT extension is one of the most attract factors for our international students with STEM degrees.

Why do U.S need our international STEM students? The tuition fee for international students is much higher than those local students. Universities make money from our international students. The local restaurants, shopping malls and service centers raise money from our international students, which even becomes the key factor supporting local economy. In long term, U.S needs STEM degrees students support it development. However, most of students with STEM degrees are international students. Without OPT extension, It will be hard for these high technology companies to recruit employees and survive, which will also interpret U.S development in the future. 

All in all, the OPT extension is a win-win choice for both STEM degrees students and U.S.
