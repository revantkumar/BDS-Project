I agree that the STEM OPT extension (24 months) is necessary. I'm from China, and studying in US for my master and PhD degrees now. My major is marine science, and my goal is becoming a marine scientist to make a difference by solving the problems we human beings are facing related to marine environment. I choose US as the place where I want to achieve my dreams in because I believe that US not only gives me the best education in the world, but also the best opportunity to work as a scientist and make a difference for the world. However, as a foreign student, finding a job and working here are very hard, especially at the time when we just graduate from school and need to change our visa status to work legally. Therefore, the STEM OPT extension is extremely important for us, since it can give us more opportunities to work here and contribute to the society by what we learn here. In my opinion, US is a nice and kind place, and we are all here for our "american dream" that everyone is equal and everyone can have a good life as long as he or she makes an effort. And the STEM OPT extension is the one that makes us foreign students have equal chances as native americans when we start to find a job and make the society and world better, and I believe we deserve these equal chances.
