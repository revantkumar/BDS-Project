Neeta Chopra I strongly SUPPORT STEM OPT extension rule. 
America is a country that has always supported equality in every way. 
The popular saying - "May the best man win" applies to this case too. If an American citizen is more suitable for a STEM job, he would definitely be hired. Extending the rule from 17 months to 24 months for international students will not have any adverse effect on the jobs of Americans in STEM fields.
