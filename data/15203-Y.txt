I am a company owner in USA. I strongly recommend the extension of new OPT policy. My reasons are given below:

1. The new OPT policy will enhance the diversity of my company. As the development of globalization, I want to sell my products to some abroad, such as China, India or South Korea. Since international students know better about their countries and they know how to seek those consumers inner heart. Thus, it will helpful for me do diverse my company and improve the selling.

2. When I sell more products and enlarge my company, it is true that it will benefit the US government a lot. Because I will pay a lot of taxes to US government, local states and local city.
