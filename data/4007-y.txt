James Anonymous I support this proposal. 

It is a good way to attract high-quality international students to make contribution to the United States. Otherwise, talented international students still have other better options to study in other countries, e.g. Canada, Australia etc. And from what I heard, if the USA was unfriendly to international students, they would never come here for study, which will affect the development of US tech companies and growth of economy.
