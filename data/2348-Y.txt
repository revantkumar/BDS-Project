I support the rule that OPT lasts three years, because it makes more people who have high degrees staying in the U.S and work for American companies and government. It is a big loss for U.S that international students learn the first class knowledge in American universities, but go back to work for their homelands. Furthermore, international students are not threat to natives, on the contrary, they are good helpers for multinational cooperation and coordination. On the one hand, international students have the background of their hometown and understand their native culture and rules. On the other hand, they accept good American education and follow policies in the U.S. 

I hope the government will accept my proposal. Thanks.
