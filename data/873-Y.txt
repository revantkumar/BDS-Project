Dear Director Saldaa,

I would like to express my earnest support of the proposed rule that rectifies and enhances the STEM extension program with a reasonable duration of extension and appropriate checks for preventing abuses. As a former student from abroad and an engineer working in an American company in California, I emphasize that the STEM extension program benefits not only students in the STEM field but also Americans as whole. It provides a more streamlined supply of labor in highly technical industries that the students do not chip away jobs of other American workers, as the students in the STEM fields aim a very specific industry segment that American workers rarely participate in. Given there is no relief in the current specialty occupation temporary work visa (dubbed "H1-B visa"), an inaction in passing the STEM extension program would adversely affect further not only businesses but also education in America, because the students would not see no merit in having their education in the United States by spending significant resources entirely bringing from their respective countries.

Regards,

Han Kim
