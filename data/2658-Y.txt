Let's not be short-sighted. Sure we can deny the extension and even OPT itself, it may provide more job openings for a short time, but what will happen next?
What will happen when high-tech companies and research facilities cannot find suitable workers with required skills? What will stop them from moving to other countries just in order to survive? 
What will happen when high-tech companies and research facilities can only hire second-rated STEM workers because the best were forced to return to there home countries? How will they remain the best in the worlds when they cannot get the best workers in the world?
What will happen to the US economy when those high-tech companies are either leaving or failing?
Without OPT and other opportunities, how will the US to attract the best and most skilled people around the globe? Without the best and most skilled people around the world, how is US going to compete with other rising nations such as China and India? Remember that for each American, there are four Chinese, and the best of them are educated here in the US and you are sending them home. Would you prefer living in "US, the world's superpower" or "US, the developing country"?
So please let's not be that short-sighted.
