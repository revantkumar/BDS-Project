Lews Young I strongly support expanding opt for the F1 nonimmigrant students in the STEM field and I have the following reasons:

1. The F1 students are highly educated and therefore, they almost never caused a problem for the U.S society directly (e.g. overall they obey the laws very strictly automatically). 

2. More importantly, they are highly educated and can fit the high tech jobs very well. Although there is concern that they might "take over" the American's job, the truth is that they can work only within the specific field they are trained to and they have very little conflict with the American people's job. The U.S economy is slowly recovering, and the high Tech companies are expanding. The F1 student within the STEM field is just for that. While the jobless claim are mostly for people without degree within STEM field, the F! student do not conflict with them. 

3. Additionally, living a life in the U.S will cost them money and they have the money, flow of money will create jobs for the U.S. Some of them could even create jobs for the Americans directly by setting up companies, e.g., Elon Musk is not an native American, but look at how many jobs he had created for the U.S.

4. It would be a lost for the U.S if these highly educated student left the U.S actually. They are prepared for the college/university by other countries, which takes them a lot of resources. Now they got their college/university education in the U.S. It's like the U.S just paid a little bit resources (the last moment work)to prepare them for creating wealth for the U.S. If they leave U.S for other countries, that's like, rather than harvesting the wealth they are going to create by the U.S, we prepare the initial work and then let the other country to harvest the wealth they are going to make. That's the lose of U.S.
