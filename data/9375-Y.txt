It's a good policy should be supported! OPT program is an important reason for foreign student to choose US over other countries like UK, Canada, etc. Foreign students made a net contribution of $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy in the 2013-2014 academic year. And from my observation, international student greatly stimulates the local economy, more and more international students move to the village I live in, leasing office is always a busy place and the rental price increase every year, also new leasing villages were built in the neighborhood. Restaurant, supermarket, malls are all benefit from foreign students, so this is unwise to push them away by cancel this program.

Speaking of the competition, it's totally unfair to say international students have anything to do with the minimum wage, most students who obtain their OPT and OPT extension are trying to get an H1B visa, which means they need about 3 times the salary of the minimum pay and the employer has to be the E-Verify company in order to be an H1B holder, and friends of mine who are in OPT right now have salaries far more than that.
