Absolutely I will strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reason:

1. The government should let the students who learned from US university have chance to apply this knowledge. They will try their best to make contributions to the U.S, since they are all hardworking and talented ones if they can find a job.
2. Competition is not a bad thing, but a good thing. People who use OPT stem to work legally do not gain for the lowest wages. They even help us a lot in some positions they are really good at. Sometimes their creative ideas enable us to think about more and contribute more. 
3. A lot of famous people who contributed to U.S a lot came to U.S as international students. They absolutely help U.S developed.
