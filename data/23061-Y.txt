I strongly approves the rules because as we all know that US is strongest in economy, one of the most impact is due to F-1 international students. There are approximately about 600K students who are pursuing master's degree. If US implements the rule of STEM OPT then it might increase the international brains to work more in US, which obviously do the development and they also do contribution with their tax. So it is simple and straight forward that if this rule approves, it will work for both US economy and the international students will have more global exposer.
