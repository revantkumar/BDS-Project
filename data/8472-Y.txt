Based on my experience, there is a huge demand for STEM students. And this rule will help to solve the issue. I am a recent graduate with CS bachelor degree. When I went to the career fair every year, I have seen an increasing demand for STEM students. The increasing demand is also reflected by the increasing base salary for college hires. However in school, I have seen way more foreign students than America students. If these F1 non-immigrants do not have the opportunity to work here, this lack of skilled STEM students will slow down economy and affect the country in other ways. On the other hand, if they do get some industry experience before they go back to their countries, these students will get the skills and experience they needed and many company will benefit from their work here.
