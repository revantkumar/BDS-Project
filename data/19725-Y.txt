I strongly support the proposal because this will contribute U.S. and our citizens in the following aspects, just to be brief:
Firstly, foreign students contributes diversity ideas and financial benefits to U.S. University. OPT extension will be one of the most important reason that U.S. attract foreign students. Our University needs this fresh blood, to be honest.
Secondly, have them stay can make them contributes more to this country right? If all of the STEM have to go back to their country, I guess the results would be, U.S loses educated and trained workers, while other country welcome their citizens home and their economy boom. I am not sure this is a good business. 
Besides,everybody complains about losing their job opportunity due to STEM students. I guess most of them didn't see any of the figures and analysis. Think about why the government needs them to stay and making this proposal? Because these STEM students did's having you lose your job, they do great help to fill the gap of worker shortage in STEM area instead. 

That's all.
