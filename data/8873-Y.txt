I totally support this proposal due to some reasons:
1. Many international engineers are experienced and well-skilled enough to make great contributions to the development of U.S.
2.International students with an OPT program also pay tax and thus support the economy of U.S.
3.U.S. is always open-minded and racial diversity is also important.
To sum up, I agree with this OPT extension proposal.
