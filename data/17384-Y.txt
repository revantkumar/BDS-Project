I believe OPT STEM extension is one of the important ways United States can retain talent. If it is cancelled, talented students will lose the motivation to remain in this country and may end up starting the process of Reverse Brain Drain to their countries which often lack infrastructure and opportunities which match up to their talents. America provides them the necessary opportunities to fully utilize their potential. This benefits not just America and the person himself/herself, but also the country he/she came from if they decide to send foreign remittances back home. America gets the candidate's talent and brain and the tax he pays while earning here, while his native country gets much needed foreign reserves. America will only be hurting itself if it does somehow manages to cancel the STEM OPT extension rule. 

Please keep in mind the welfare of America and thousands of international students studying here, with so much investments and aspirations. I believe the STEM extension ought to be raised by a minimum of 36 months.
