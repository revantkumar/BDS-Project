I approve this new policy. If OPT length could be three years, I don't need apply H1 anymore, I can work three years when I'm still young, gathering experience. I really don't want stay in US, when I'm growing old, this will benefit both parties. US can get well educated people do some work which natives don't want to take, like low level computer developer.
