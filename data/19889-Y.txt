This rule can bring more STEM international students to the US. If US lacks STEM workers, these students can fill the gap. If US does not lack STEM workers, these students are great consumers whose spending of money will create numerous jobs for the US. In either situation, this rule will benefit US economy a lot. I strongly support this rule.
