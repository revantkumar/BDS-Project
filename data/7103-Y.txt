I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. With the approval of such proposal, the students will be able to have a better chance finding an opportunity applying their knowledge. 

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. The labor force market also need such diversity to thrive

3. Competition does exist, but is will beneficial to the society, such competition will help U.S. technology industries secure the lead position in the world.
