Min Tan I strongly support the latest extension proposals on OPT and STEM. Without these extension there would be a double blow for US economy. First, American companies would lose its talent advantage over companies in other countries. The US is an immigration country. Foreigners made huge contribution as the US became the greatest country in the world. Disowning international students amounts to unfair dismissal of American history and self-identity. Then less and less international students would be willing to study in the US. They spend a huge amount of their parents' money to pay tuition and living expenses. By average, they would spend $60,000 each person for each academic year. These money helps boost American education and economy. Universities can use these extra money to give scholarships/fellowships to American students in need, hire more professors, and fund more research projects. The loss of money contributed by international students would hit economy, American students and the universities in the end.
