I'm a citizen and I went to grad school in electrical engineering with many F-1 students from a lot of countries, mostly Asia. They are brilliant and hard working. They always helped me when I got stuck. A lot of countries, especially Asian countries, have very good education in the fundamentals of science, which helps them a lot in picking up new subjects and explaining science phenomena. I learned a lot from them. I now work in a IT consulting company. Many of my coworkers are immigrants with transferrable skills from fields other than IT. They are smart and they are quick learners. They transferred to IT consulting and became good at it. I again learned a lot from them on the analytical skills and their thinking patterns. They also learn from us on the social and communicative skills. Difference makes it fun. I truly hope these people can stay in the US because we learn from each other and that is very beneficial. We want our working environment and society to be comprehensive and diversified. That is the base US is founded. In nowadays, people is power. We don't want to lose them.
