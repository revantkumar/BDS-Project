I strongly support the proposed rules about OPT. I am a U.S. citizen whose parents are both international students. As a 2-year old boy, I am in great need of a complete family and loving care from parents. My mother, as a non-STEM student, has already used up her one year OPT and left U.S. My father is a STEM student. Anything that can help him stay longer in U.S. with me are extremely important to me. For any American whose parents are foreigners, we share the same need that the spirit of family will be considered into any government regulations.
