I had an internship a few months ago. The boss used to own a manufacturing factory. However, his business goes down because his competitors' business went to developing countries. He cannot compete with their cheap price. After closing this factory, he decided to start a consulting company, aiming to help other manufacturers do their process cheaper, quicker and smarter. Do do that, he needs someone very smart in software simulation and solid engineering background. Moreover, it would be best if that guy doesn't ask for too much salary. 

That is why employers prefer international students. They don't ask for too much compensation, they are well-educated. They dare to take initiative in new business. They help to protect the business of the States. To give them an opportunity to help Americans, we need this new OPT extension regulations. Please, don't think what the country could do for you, think about what you can do for the country.
