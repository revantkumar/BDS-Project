I strongly support the extension. I am a uber driver at downtown LA. Every night I go to usc to earn money because there are lots of students studying overnight and need a ride home. Among them over 80% are international students studying engineering majors, who have heavy course loads and pressure and study more than 10hrs per day. If they all left US because of lacking working opportunities, I would have no job and income too...
