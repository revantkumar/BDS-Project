Guanhua Fan I strongly agree to the new OPT extension(24 months) proposal. Because international students earn job opportunities through their technical and professional endeavors. I believe United States is a nation which accepts and pays for individuals who thrive to fight for his/her own dreams. Since most of the international students are working in spheres of science, technology, pharmaceutical, telecommunication, and education, I see no reason why US government is going to turn down their talent and contribution. Meanwhile increase the extension will not necessarily jeopardize the employment rate for American people. On the contrary, international students working in US will in some way help push more job opportunities for American citizens. For example, American vendor companies(all domains) relies on OPT and H1B workers tremendously. Thus, we should take this impersonally and equally. All in all, it is the knowledge who provides job opportunities.
