I think at least Ph.D. Students with STEM major needs to be considered carefully.
1. I think a survey can be conducted to find out the portion of international students on STEM majors. Most of the Ph.D. students are international students, potentially they are more valuable than students with MS and bachelor degrees. The proportion of local american students in STEM majors is much smaller. Actually, the competition between American students and international students is much less. 
2. Ph.D. students are more important in some of the specific areas with their background.
3. STEM extension is not only good for the development of US. economy but also a good opportunity for international students to improve their capability.
