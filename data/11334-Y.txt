I support the DHS' decision on extending the OPT for international students.
Here are my reasons and also the comments on those opinions from other people:

1. About taking citizens' jobs away:
The OPT extension is available for those students in STEM majors with a bachelor's
degree or higher. These students are LEGAL and highly skilled. It has nothing to
do with illegal immigrants. These people contributed a lot to the technologies
and disciplines which made US in the leading role of many industries. These
contribution created more jobs than taken. So it is short-sighted to say
these people are taking away US citizens' jobs.

2. About necessity of OPT for students:
I saw a comment saying the engineering or similar majors do not need internships
or practicing. This is totally wrong because we all know that there is always a gap
between the knowledge on books and the practical applications. Letting students
to practice can let them better utilize the knowledge from school.

3. About the spirit of America:
If we look through the history of US, we can know OPEN and DIVERSITY is the
reason why US is still the strongest country in the world. History has told us
close and conservation will stop innovation and hurt the country in a long run.
