"American dream" makes our country so distinctive with other countries in the world. I don't see any reason why we should be against OPT extension proposal. Everyone who can benefit our nation should deserve a chance to chase his dream. For those who are against this proposal, you already lose great merits that support our nation till today. 
We should make our mind open, that is the way how our next generation could compete the kids from China, India.
