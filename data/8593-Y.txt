Bailong Zhuangzi (2nd Comment) I am a US citizen and a graduate student studying the computer science. I fully support this proposed OPT rule. This regulation would indeed allow more international students to enter the job markets related to the majors involved in STEM program. As an American, I have to say it really imposes more pressure when we are hunting a job after graduation. However, there are indeed a numerous of international students talented in programming and mathematics in the school. Studying along with them really improves my skills and abilities significantly by competing and interacting with them. It would be much more beneficial if our country could offer them good opportunities to make contribution in industry and academia in the long term. The US citizens are still easier to get a job when they are equipped with the required skills due to the lower cost compared with those who request H1B visa. If our American objects to this rule and refuse more talents to work for the country, the essential reason is we are not confident in ourselves. We are afraid that foreigners steal good lives from us. Finally, I would like to bring two facts: 1. we were all immigrants some time before. 2. the only thing we should do is to improve ourselves and not rejecting others.
