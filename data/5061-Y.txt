I SUPPORT the regulation for OPT extension.
But if there is a restriction like only international students in the field of STEM with master's or PhD's degrees can apply for this OPT extension, it will be better.
This can keep talented international students working for us to create more fortune, and provide an employment security for our local undergraduate students. Also international students are great competitors and impulsion for us to study harder and work harder. Our society can benefit from it.
