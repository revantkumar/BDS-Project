OPT options for legitimate students is a good intention. However, there are innumerable students especially from India working in restaurants, gas stations, motels and grocery stories. All these students have been working illegally. These students use OPT as the buffer students to work for "consultant" jobs. These jobs fake experience and some how manage. 

All these is a perfect demonstration of how much of a IT has become a joke. OPT has to be dismissed and a drive has to be undertaken to permanently deport all illegally working Indian students. This will bring back the "quality" over "quantity". I have worked with many high quality Indian IT work force. This emerging fake students have to be forced back and retain the respect of deserving students who have worked hard to come up. The students choosing the "easy underground route" should not allowed to be stay longer by this OPT.
