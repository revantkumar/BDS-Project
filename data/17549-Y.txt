As a PHD in mathematics, I always heard complaints from my best friends who have already got a good job or an intern but are likely to be rejected to stay in the USA in a few months because of the so limited time of OPT. Even if I extract out my personal feelings, I think it's quite unreasonable to reject to lengthen the duration of OPT especially after talented and hardworking students like my friends have tried so hard to find out their efforts seen as dust. It's obviously an counter example for the claim that the USA is a place where everyone deserves its own dream.
