It is already difficult enough to obtain employment as a international student here in the US, even with the OPT STEM Extension in place. I, personally, disagree with the claim that the rule restricts opportunities for US workers. Often, an employer immediately would end discussions with me upon realizing my VISA status. To get to this point, where I am awaiting this ruling to continue my employment here in the US, I feel I've worked harder than many of my peers I went to school with. Perhaps those complaining haven't worked as hard as we have - something I'm continuing to do at my computer, which positively impacts the US economy.

There is no doubt I would reconsider my advice to the next generation of students in my hometown deciding on post-secondary education here in the US if this rule were not put in place. While I enjoyed my time very much and acknowledge it has definitely shaped who I am today, I will definitely be telling those back home of the struggles I've had to face, the uncertainty I've faced after settling in for the four years as an undergraduate.
Please consider the consequences this decision might make.
