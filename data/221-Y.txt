I am against any increase in foreign workers in the United States of America. 
I want E-Verify enacted, made mandatory, and employers who do not use it fined.
And I want that Immigration and Customs Enforcement Bureau Proposed rule "Improving and Expanding raining Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant students With Stem Degrees and CapGap Relief for All Elibible F- Students" KILLED. 
Why is everyone in the United States government trying to get foreign workers to take every job inside the United States away from American workers????
I want this nonsense now proposed stopped completely.
