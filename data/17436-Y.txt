I am in the 8th month of opt. I am a M.S. of major of biology. This new rule will definitely be benefit to me for the following reasons:
1. I am now a research assistant in a biological lab. My and my whole lab's aim is to get good scientific discover and publish our data. It is known that to finish just one well qualified paper, at least two to three years is essential. So this rule will give us enough time to do experiments, collect data and write high quality paper.
2. As far as I know, a large number of biological labs meet the pressure of being cutting fund, or even hard to get fund. This situation also happens in my lab. It is large burden for most PI to support a H1B to their RA. But to support a opt period person, it is much more economical. So this rule will help biological labs to operate.
