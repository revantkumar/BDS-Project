Great proposal! 

I am not sure about the rationale behind the comment "foreigners are stealing jobs from Americans". If foreign students are stealing jobs, why there is still a shortage of workers in STEM field? Companies could hire Americans who "lost their job because of foreigners" to fill the gap. There are many reasons that a person cannot find a job. The solution should not be scaring people who are more talented than you away, but make yourself more competitive in the job market. 

Also I am afraid if STEM extension got canceled, fewer foreign students will choose American as a destination for higher education. One of the most fascinating part of America is its openness to people who is talented and has dreams. There are so many opportunities here as long as you are willing to work hard and not afraid to try. And that's one of the biggest reason I chose American for my Masters Degree instead of UK, Australia etc. The cancelation of STEM extension will make America much less attractive as a destination for foreign students.
