Juli Willis I am an American mother of an American son who will be entering college next fall majoring in computer science. He is graduating high school with high honors, and scored in the 95th percentile on his SAT. Upon graduation from college, He will certainly qualify for the many STEM positions in America. Why should he, like so many similarly situated college grads, have difficulty finding a job? Because our government is giving corporations incentives to hire cheap foreign labor, rather than well-qualified American citizens?

The claim that corporations are simply unable to find qualified American workers to fill STEM job openings is bogus! Stop allowing corporations to get away with what they're doing, and force them to hire the many qualified Americans who are seeking employment!
