I totally support the proposal. It not only benefits the international students themselves but also the US companies and even US citizen job seekers. Expanding OPT would allow the international students to apply what they have learned in American universities to a real world and gain more valuable work experience. On another hand, those international students with one year work experience in US company have just been familiar with their fields and work content, which are the US companies love to see. Extending the opt for one more year would save a lot of cost to recruit new employees and training them. Those competitive international students also make US job market more vigorous.
