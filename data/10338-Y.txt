I support DHS new OPT extension because international students have historically made significant contributions to the United States, both through the payment of tuition and other expenditures in the United States economy. In addition to these general benefits, STEM students further contribute though research, innovation, and the provision of knowledge and skills that help maintain and grow increasingly important sectors of the the United States economy.
