The government should not be helping foreigners take qualified American jobs just to lower their costs through wages. You are lowering standards all the way around and destroying the fabric of this country and its laws. If people wish to come here, assimilate and become Americans and add to our culture, that is one thing but to purposely change the fabric of our country and the values we have fought 200 years to attain is dead wrong and I resent my tax dollars being used this way
