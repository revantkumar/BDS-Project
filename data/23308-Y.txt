Extension of OPT SETM is a great police for everyone in American. Here are my ideas to support this policy:
1, with a longer OPT extension time, more foreigners with high quality will stay in US and introduce more work achievements, and lots of diversity in cultures. With more culture conflicts, there are plenty of technical innovations that could give more advantages to our daily life. 
2. Keep this OPT STEM, it will help people working in American with more competitive, no matter native people or foreigners. In order to have a better position in companies, everyone needs work harder to gain this. It will keep a virtuous circle for American future.
3. Without OPT or extension, lots of foreigner students cannot have an experience working in oversea, and it will reduce the value of studying abroad. They may not choose American for college study which causes the talents losing and education business loss to American also.
