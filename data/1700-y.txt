Gina Miller I totally support this policy. As a hiring manager in a tech company, I have to say, we never lower the salary because of the citizenship of our candidates. However, we spend more money on foreign employees. Because we need to pay the lawyer fee for getting a working visa for them. So actually in the hiring process, we prefer to have citizens rather than foreigners. However, most of the citizens is not skilled enough for most of the positions, which is a shame. 

So Americans, don't blame that you don't get the job here. Spend your time on improving yourselves!
