Merrily Berman At a time that unemployment is at an all time high,
F-1 visas should be at an all time low.

F-1 visas are the biggest overstays along with
B1-B2 - visitors. This is a phoney honor system
which just proves INS / DHS operates a broken
system.

Expanding F-1 is senseless and a slap in
the face to Americans. We should Train and educate 
the unemployed - especially the college educated
that cannot find jobs in their field of study but
are struggling with college loans.
