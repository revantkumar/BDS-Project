I strongly support this proposal for the following four reasons. 

First, the US government should take the advantage of letting the student educated by the US Universities making contributions to the US. Many of international students are well trained by the universities, especially for students in STEM majors that are most technical majors. They have are valuable human capitals that can improving international competition ability of US enterprises and such that boost US economy.

Second, expanding OPT can bring benefit for US educational organisation. The International students bring revenues and cultural diversities to education organisation. Most of students, want the opportunities to have more work experiences in the country they complete their educations. Expanding OPT can attracting more students who want to study in STEM majors choosing US as the place they want to study abroad.

Third, international students getting into job market is not the original reason that makes some US unemployed and competitions is not a bad thing. Many Companies actually have preference on Americans, since we can see for sales and other less technical positions employers seldom hiring international students. However, sometimes companies cannot find an American that can do the same work as an international student with STEM degree. Even if there are no international students, some Americans still cannot be hired for some specific positions. In addition, the competition in the job market is healthy. People can study more and work hard to be more competitive and US need more competitive and productive employees.

Last, US companies especially those in high tech sectors need huge amount STEM degree student and the supply may not enough if there are only American candidates.
