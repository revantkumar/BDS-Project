3 years OPT helps to train a qualified STEM worker. It provides a sufficient time to train STEM students to be qualified engineer/scientists (compared with the 3-5 years 
residency period of medical school graduates).

OPT/STEM OPT does NOT take away job opportunities from U.S. resident. OPT is for training and serving as a part of university education. The OPT students who want to be working in U.S. in long term has to be converted to H1B Visa, which the major contributor that takes away jobs from local residents. The results of 2015 H1B 
approval shows that only less than 15% of the approvals are given to 
OPT students, the rest are granted to workers that are imported from other 
countries directly. If government want to control foreign workers and keep 
more jobs to local residents. The right thing is to issue a H1B policy 
change. Revoking STEM OPT will do very little to help.
