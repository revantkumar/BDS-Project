I believe this is beneficial to both the international students who plan to stay in the US and practice their skills and the US economy. This evidently enlarges the working force here in the US and at the same time, measures to ensure US citizens are not pushed out of the labor market are also implemented. I support this rule and hope this could temporarily ease the difficulties that the outdated immigration policy has brought, eg. the H-1-B Cap that was set up in the 90s and the outsource companies were taking advantage of.
