I strongly support this policy since
1. The introduction of foreign talents every year is an extremely significant reason that the US can stay in top of the world. 

2. Rescission of this policy will reduce the attraction to foreign talents. Also, there will be less international students, who contribute to considerable amount of the states' income by paying tuition fees. This, American's economy will be affected in an negative way. 

3. Extension of STEM won't cause the unemployment of native people as many opposers suggested. Since American industries are still rapidly developing, especially for modern technology like computer science and engineering. The job market is growing much faster than amount of new immigrants. Compare to unemployment, shortage of high-tech talents is more detrimental to US economy. And highly educated F-1 students will help fill this shortage.

4. Founding Principles declared equal rights for everyone. This is how American is and how American should always be. American should never evict someone who get their jobs by their own efforts and talents. For those who want to reduce the unemployment of local people by exclude F-1 students out, it won't work, and by doing this, you are trying to change your beloved country in a negative way.
