STEM OPT extension will benefit american industries by retaining talented students working in the states for 2 years longer. It will NOT aggravate unemployment among US residents! The annual H1B slots are not increased and there's 1/3 chance of getting the visa. STEM OPT extension can increase the proportion of STEM students winning the lottery. But the overall number of H1B visa is not changed. In addition, the number of H1B visa issued to STEM students is only a small portion, taking into account the previous 17 month OPT extension. The job openings in STEM industries, most require strong technical skills and many years of trainings, can certainly overcome the slight increase of international students.
