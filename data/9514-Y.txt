Expanding the training opportunities of non-immigrant students is a great move. It will help American employees learn techniques used across the globe to improve their efficiency, this will also encourage more smart and talented people from around the world to come here for education and cause a huge inflow of funds for the universities too. Since this restricts students from working outside their field of study, it will not cause any residents to lose their jobs making this a sensible decision for everyone involved
