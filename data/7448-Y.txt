STEM OPT extension should be approved. You don't want those native students who copied the homework of international students to ruin your internet your building your bridge your electricity your everything. They never spent one hour focusing on their jobs but parade and protest uselessly all the time to attack "foreigners" who have to handle the shit they left on work. I don't mean there's no native STEM student who is hard working, but real hard working people won't waste their time to spread negative unreasonable comments here.
