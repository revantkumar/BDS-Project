Xiang Huo I STRONGLY SUPPORT this proposed rule.

Because of the previous OPT extension rule, more smart and excellent international students would like to choose US to purchase their master or PhD degree. After getting the degree their also have the opportunity to sharp their professional skill. Because of those students' hard work, the industry, especially IT, can enjoy a huge advantage in talented person. First International students could bring much more idea to American company. When those company have some international business, the international students also can play as a bridge to help. Second, having talent employees is prerequisite to make great idea done. Hard working and being good at technology is another benefit brought by international students. 

American citizens may worry about those international students will take their job while there are still lots of them out work. I don't believe this is true. For my own experience, most student major in STEM, like computer science, are international students. Most American student would like to choose economy rather than STEM. And all american student in STEM could find excellent. This fact means only American citizen can't fill the hole if all international students go back to their homeland. And this will absolutely impact the future of industry in America, America and American people.

So please let the proposed rule pass, make a both-win decision.
