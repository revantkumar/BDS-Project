I strongly support this from the point view of an employer.

I have team members from different countries, like China, US, India, etc. However, I always find Chinese students are the smartest and most hard-working. I really couldn't imagine what my team would be if all Chinese students are forced to go back and only Americans are left. We Americans are good at communicating and personal skills but we don't master the math and techinical stuff. So Chinese and Indian students are actually very important to my team and even our company. They do the dirty work. 

I really think it's important for them to stay.
