YES! I STRONGLY SUPPORT the opt-extension. I believe OPT-extension would be in the best interest of our nation!

As someone has 6+ years experience in the high tech industry, I can tell you that the tech companies can never hire enough talents these days. If you don't believe, just please ask the hiring managers and recruiters in Google, Facebook or Amazon, they will tell you. The fact is that USA does not have enough STEM talents. USA needs the foreign talents who graduated from USA universities. Educating and training these talents in the schools then just let them go back to their countries, this is not a wise idea. We need them to keep our high tech industry running well, and running better than the rest of the world. Thanks!
