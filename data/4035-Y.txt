William Kennedy There is a shortage of professional jobs for graduates around the world, much worse in India & China than here, and OPT opens the floodgates for them to come here, competing unfairly with Americans because dollars are worth far more in their home countries, and also employers pay less tax for them. China uses high tech gleaned from the West to build their weapons systems, and OPT, H-1B, etc. are open doors for them to pick up the know-how they need here.

Global corporations naturally want to move work where labor is cheapest, & training workers from those countries helps them do that. The strongly pro-H-1B Berkeley professor AnnaLee Saxenian found that more than 80% of the Indian and Chinese engineers in Silicon Valley share technological information with firms in their home countries, with over half investing in tech back home.
