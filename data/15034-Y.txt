James Miller There should be no incentive, whatsoever, for employers to hire foreign workers until American workers are fully employed. Between the allowing of illegal immigrants and the illegal benefits they are receiving from a lawless government, no preference, in fact, should be given to any foreign worker.
Our government was conceived to serve the U.S. citizens, not betray or serve over them. Our rights are the only rights this government should consider!
