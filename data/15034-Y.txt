I strongly SUPPORT this proposal. 

Competition and fresh blood is the source of progressing. US should allow more and more smart international student join the employment market. It will help millions companies to find good employees, and it will definitely stimulate the economy.

Plus, the education is a very big business. Millions of international students bring billions of dollars every year. They spend money not only on tuition, but also on other things,like accommodation, etc. If they cannot find a job in US, they may want to go another countries, like Canada or Australia. That will be a great lost of US.
