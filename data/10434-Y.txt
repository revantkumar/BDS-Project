I am amazed that this has to be debated in the first place rather than unanimously approved by all and sundry. If a student has been found worthy in learning and character in one of the best institutions in the world, she should not be denied of the opportunity to contribute to the world's growth and prosperity. I support OPT. Please give all the citizens of the world equal chance to lead us to the future. I support OPT 100%!
