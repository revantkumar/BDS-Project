I'm SUPPORT OPT Extension. The U.S. government has no idea the how STEM will affect economy if the policy is canceled. Not only a lot of technics, talents will be forced to leave the country but also the international student who're applying for university degree will be drop dramatically going forward because the US government is sending signals that this country is not for talents, not for internationalism, and not for the opportunity for the future. You know what, the future of a country doesn't depend on those who are in the position with shining title but has to do with those who work hard and know real righteousness by heart.
