American Citizens should come first.
These programs should all be scaled back dramatically, at least until Americans get back on there feet and wages are stabilized.
With all these people coming in it's making it hard for the almost 100 million Americans that are out of work to find a job.
The labor force is so saturated that employers are able to depress the wages to almost slave wages.
It isn't right and this is killing the American dream for everyone.
