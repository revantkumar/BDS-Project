Amy Snow I strongly SUPPORT this proposal for following reasons:

1. America and its education industry invest a lot of time and recourse into educating STEM students. They are very valuable investment for America for developing its economy and society. Shorter period of OPT time means these STEM students will come back earlier and make contribution to their mother countries. If this happens, it will be a great waste and loss for American education investment.

2. OPT programs, especially the STEM OPT programs that are mentioned in the proposal, are only available among the top American universities. The graduates from these top schools will be very valuable for their specific industries development. Except U.S., other countries also want these excellent students come to their countries for studying, working and making contribution. It will be a much smarter choice for U.S. to keep these outstanding students and make them contribute for American development. But if the STEM OPT is cancelled, the American education and working environment will be much less attractive for these STEM students and they will be able easily to find another countries for working or studying, even if they like the states more.
