I support the newly proposed OPT extension rule. Thanks DHS for bringing it up. Colleges and universities will keep competitive by providing the OPT and OPT extensions to the STEM students. Don't forget about all the contributions these foreign students/works make to our country. In addition, I've seen the international students benefit from the previous OPT extension rule in terms of their career development. I would like to see the new rule become effective.
