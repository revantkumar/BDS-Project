Reason:
The people who oppose 24 months OPT because they want the students on F-1 to return to their home country soon.
Why 12 months OPT rule won't work:
The companies in their home country demands more experience and expertise than just 12 month of OPT experience. The technology is changing and improving in a much faster manner than ever at the same time it has become so complex to learn and understand. All the employers demand for the best, the highest educated and well trained students to work for them. With changing technology and industry demand, it has become impossible for students on F-1 to get the required practical experience and expertise in just 12 months of OPT period. 

Reason:
The people who oppose 24 months OPT because some companies tend to delay the process to get the H1 or Green Card for students and in turn diminishing the benefits of whole advanced degree program - to make the best talent stay in the US.
Why 12 months OPT rule won't work:
The H1 and Green Card processing is the big commitment even for the students. In this competitive market, even for the best talent, it is hard to find an employer in just 12 months with whom he can have those big commitments. 

Reason: 
Increasing cost of education 
Why 24 months OPT rule work:
With increasing cost of education, the students on F-1 finds it hard to earn the invested amount in just 12 months of OPT. If the students feel that return on investment is not good in the US, there will be less admissions for higher education which is again bad for the US and the US economy.
