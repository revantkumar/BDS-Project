STRONGLY SUPPORT NEW IMMIGRATION REGULATIONS

1. It's nothing more about the outflow of talent.
International STEM student come to the US to make their own contribution, if the new immigration regulations is stopped, US seems to be not that competitive for national talents. Personally, Europe would be more preferable than the US in that situation, since many more European countries are starting to welcome the World. 

2.What STEM education is for? 
Training the most professional technical human-being to change our life and light our future. Well, if all the talents is well trained here in the US, and then go back to their hometown, using the knowledge they've learned from here, to build their country a much more powerful one, then..can I say US is helping to booming the rest of the world except itself? Especially, I noticed there are lots of Asian STEM students, I guess they wouldn't go study or work in US is OPT extension is stopped. Let's imagine how this will strongly affect Google, Apple, IBM..etc, well, will I have the chance to use IPhone 8 anymore?
