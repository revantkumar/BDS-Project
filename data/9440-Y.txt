Carol Wang I SUPPORT this new OPT policy
For some reason:

1. The Economic Benefit of International Students $26.8 billion Contributed; 340,000 U.S. Jobs Supported. (2013-2014 from NAFSA: http://www.nafsa.org/_/File/_/eis2014/USA.pdf) Assume we lose 1/10 of them, we will lose 3 Billion and more than 34,000 jobs.

2.US is losing the lead in technology: The U.S. share of the worlds science and engineering graduates is declining rapidly as European and Asian universities, particularly from China, have increased S&E degrees while US degree production has stagnated.

3. In 2013, more than one in three international students in the U.S. were enrolled in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), according to the Institute of International Education (IIE). STEM innovation, a key driver of national economic growth, has increased significantly the global demand for STEM talent. In the midst of this worldwide competition for talent, higher education institutions (HEIs), as incubators of innovation, aim to attract more STEM students to their institutions. 

4. International STEM Students on Campus Benefit Their U.S. Classmates.
