I strongly support this rule and hope there will be easier path for highly demanded high tech foreign students and degree holders. They are needed if this country would like to continue the leading position in the world. Several of my friends with masters and Phds in Math, statistics, Engineering can not continue working in US without worries due to broken system. And many talents have been recruited by Asian and European countries.
