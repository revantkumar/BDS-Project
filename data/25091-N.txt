April 2014 I was let go from a company after 34+ years of service. Reduced because of restructuring they said. My tasks were all taken over by a new hire foreigner (H1B) who stayed on with the company after the restructuring. A year and a half later I can still not find work in that field or at anywhere near the same pay level. So I sit here unemployed (oops sorry, my unemployment ran out after 26 weeks, so now I'm not unemployed just not working and no longer counted) and unable to get a job because I am too old (as I was told by one company "we want younger people right out of college that we can pay 2/3 your salary"). 

I am so sorry and disappointed that my government won't help me, or my GOLD STAR family, out to reach my retirement (by allowing me to continue to work). At age 60 I am not eligible for any government assistance until I reach 66+ and only then if Social Security is still valid. Well being a working middle class person, living pay-check to pay check, I have not been able to save for my retirement enough money to carry me for 7.6 years to get to Social Security. Not being employed I am unable to restructure my debt and mortgage to a lower / longer term to be able to survive.

Please consider us older workers, with the skills needed in STEM, when you vote to NOT EXTEND the number of Foreign Immigrants allowed in on the H1B program.
