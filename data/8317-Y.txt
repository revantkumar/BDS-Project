As US citizen, I support new OPT STEM rules for international students. I know a lot of very smart international students. I do believe these international students are able to make huge contributions to our country. In addition, as I have known, US tech companies definitely prefer US citizens over international students if they have the same skill set and capability because they can work here without any sponsor. It is obvious unfair for international students. Hence, I maintain US government should give a chance to talented international students. Again, I would like to stress I totally support new OPT STEM rules!
