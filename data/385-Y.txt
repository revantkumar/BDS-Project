Please approve this new reguglation. For me, the stem opt opportunity is the most important reason that bring me to the US. Without this immigration regulation, I might not consider spend that much money to study oversea and being so far away from my family. I believe that most of international students hold the same opinion with me, which means, without this immigration regulation, US university and government might lose a huge profit from the international students, and this outcome will definitely impact US's economy so badly.
