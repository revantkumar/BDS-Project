Stephanie Hernandez My comments are as follows:

Lengthened STEM Extension Period.
-I think this is a good idea. However, the spirit of the law for an F-1 non-immigrant visa status holder is that the student will come to the U.S., graduate, get practical training in their field and return to their home country. However, with the extended time for STEM extension the practical training component is actually longer than the degree they completed. In other words, students are getting more time getting practical training than it actually took to get the degree. In this case, it would change their objectives in the U.S. The new objective would be to work rather than get a degree to take back home. If the government is truly expecting the OPT STEM extension to be part of their academic learning then it does not make sense that the practical training component is longer that the academic portion. It would make more sense to model the STEM extension like the J program, where the length of time spent doing practical training is dependent on the length of the program or 18 months, whichever comes first. 

Ability to base STEM OPT extension on a previously obtained STEM degree.
-A DSO would not be able to determine if the student is eligible for a STEM extension if the STEM degree was acquired at another institution. A DSO would only be able to truly verify that a student has completed a STEM degree at their own intuition. 
-Furthermore, they would also not be able to verify if another institution is accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department of Education.

Mentoring and Training Plan.
-This is a great idea! To make the employers and students more accountable of the types of employment given to international students.
-I think it should be made clear that a DSO would and should not be required to "evaluate" the job training and salary for students. As a DSO is neither trained nor an expert on what constitutes proper training and salary for students on STEM Extension.
-The DSOs should only be expected to check for completeness and inconsistencies.

I-910 form
-I think the proposed I-910 form should be a requirement for the STEM extension application with the I-765 form. 
-I don't think the DSO's contact information should be a requirement on the student's portion of the form. Bigger schools have many DSOs and not one DSO is signed to particular students. Therefore, taking off the requirement would alleviate questions from students asking who their DSO is. 
-The period 6 month evaluation should be made separate from the form, as it the current format requires the fulfillment of the entire form at once. 

Burden on DSOs
-These proposed STEM OPT rules will cause more burden on DSOs.
-Although, there is an acknowledgement of the burden to DSOs and an estimated cost of compliance, DSO will not be compensated nor given more resources by their schools in order to successfully comply with all requirements. 
-There needs to be some formal guidance towards to schools to ensure that DSO are also being compensated fairly. 

Reinstatement
-As of now, we have no guidance on how reinstatement criteria for students on OPT, because although students violate their status they are not any consequences for it taken in -SEVIS. The DSO has no authority to terminate records, therefore reinstatement applications are non-existent. 
-There needs to be guidance on what violation is redeemable and what violations are not.
-We also need to know if the student should be working during reinstatement.
-Typically, when a student is violates their status, they can apply for reinstatement. However, they are not allowed to partake in any benefits (i.e. employment) would the same apply?
-Can a student apply for reinstatement for a benefit?
