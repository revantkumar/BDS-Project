Yue Wang, Sidley Austin LLP International students are making huge contributions to the U.S. economy. Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011, and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010. International students who are eligible for STEM OPT are often the best in their fields, and have substantial capacity to generate employment for the local economy in various academia and industry fields.

Many students eligible for STEM OPT extension are likely to apply for H1-B visa in the upcoming years. H1-B visa, by definition, is a visa issued to highly educated professionals in "specialty occupations". Therefore, H1-B holders are very unlikely to drive down minimum wage or hurt the low-income American families; instead, STEM OPT holders and potential H1-B holders are most likely to create far more jobs for American citizens, pay more taxes, and create a culture of diversity, mutual respect and international outlook in various working environments. Such a healthy and diverse working culture is vital for U.S. universities and corporations to keep their competitive edge in this global, knowledge-based economy. 

I believe the DHS should pass the proposed rule to grant the OPT extension benefits to more STEM students.
