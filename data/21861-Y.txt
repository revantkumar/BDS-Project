After viewing those negative comments, I'm really worrying about the future of the U.S. Do you know how Facebook and Google become the greatest company in the world? Ask your engineering friend. You will know that OPT students are giving huge powerful contributions to them. Without the extension of OPT, without the contribution from other counties students, those companies cannot improve so fast as now. I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.
