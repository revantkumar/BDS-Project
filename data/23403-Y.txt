I believe the expanding for Training Opportunities for F1 students has great significance for the following reasons. 

First of all, it boosts the technology and economy development in USA. By allowing F1 students more time to work for USA, these students can devote their time and passion to work for companies and utilize their knowledge to make profits for these companies. Without the OPT extension, USA would loss a tremendous invaluable human resources. This would definitely impede the economy and impair the development of technology.

Second, for companies, they can hire F1 students to help them grow their business. It would be a great loss for the company if they can't hire an ideal candidate only because that candidate can't extend his/her OPT. 

Third, for students, they have more time to work in the industry and utilize their strengths to gain more experiences. With these experiences, they can pursue a better career path and have more chance to be successful in their career. 

Based on these three reasons, I strongly support the expanding for Training Opportunities for F1 students!
