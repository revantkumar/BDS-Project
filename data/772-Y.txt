It is unjust, shortsighted to deprive international students' legal right to work in US with OPT extension. 

There is a belief that minimum wages cannot get raised because there are too many international students are also unreasonable and against fact. However, I am strongly convinced that International students have nearly nothing to do with the minimum wage. Almost all international students obtain their OPT in order to get an H1B visa, which requires the worker to meet a minimum salary standard that is far higher than the minimum wage level.

On top of this, international students have very little responsibility for the current salary level in software and Internet industry. My observation is that the main obstacle of a faster salary rise in this industry is outsourcing, not international students. Actually compared to other industries, I dont see a lower salary level in these two.

Rejecting international students would gain a short-term relief that there might be temporarily fewer competitors in the job market. However, this short-term satisfaction would be at the cost of long-term benefits of American people and would cause the US to lose ground to the countries that welcome these students.

International students are helping America grow, and improving the welfare of American people. Losing them, on the other hand, will benefit our competitors and harm US interest. I strongly believe we should pass this proposal and make it easier for the international students to stay.
