Pursuing Masters in United States is a dream for many international students. They jive in here and bring new ideas and create new opportunities in united states. For an example, many CEO's of top Tech Companies are international students that came to USA to purse education. Now if international students are asked to leave just for a technical reason is not helpful for both the students and United States. 
As an international student, I see a big help to students by extending STEM OPT. It not only boosts moral in students to concentrate on their research than status, but also helps the country in creating new opportunities. I strongly advocate for this rule and hope this bring cheers within the STEM Community.
