Zhiqiang Liu I am strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reason:

1. First of all, I think US should let the students who purchase knowledge in U.S. have the chance to see if they can contribute to the society or not. Given them time to work in US after graduate is a necessary process to see if the education is helpful and useful.

2. Secondly, a lot of students are trying their best to make the country better and they did do a great job on lots of fields. Diversity is one of the most important spirit of U.S., that is what we should keep.

3. Finally, it is necessary to keep competition, which is the source to make a better world. You can not just let them go away. And there is no denying that most international students are doing jobs like coding, which you can hardly find lots of americans to do.

Thus I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.
