Sheila Yan I strongly SUPPORT this proposal for the following reasons:

1. Students who have earned their degrees in US deserve job opportunities. If they cannot have jobs just because they don't have US citizenship, it is definitely ironic for US who claimed "all men are created equal".

2. High tech companies have strong needs for high educated students, that's why they hire thousands of foreign students every year. If no more OPT any more, this will have strong negative impact on US high tech industries themselves.

3. Competition does exist. But only competition could push everyone forward. No pains, no gains. Without competition, US eventually will lose its proudly huge advantages.
