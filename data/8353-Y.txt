Regulations?? More?? I do not understand what I just read. I don't think I liked it whatever it means. I bet you 90% of the people who reads this has no idea what it means.

AND that is the way it is with any FEDERAL REGULATIONS.

The govt has NO BUSINESS what so ever trying to regulate any learning institution...........PERIOD!!!!

THAT is the PTA'S job.

THE FED writes 10 pages of non sense when 2 would do it if they would write everything like it was for high school students. NOT LAWYERS OR SCIENTIST.
