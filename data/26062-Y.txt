I strongly support the proposal of the OPT extension. First of all, the United States is a diverse country with many opportunities for people with dream and positive thoughts about their future! Cancelling the opt extension would influence more than a million international students and the growth of the is economic. Employers will greatly benefit from the opt exits soon program by hiring international students with multiple culture, language, academic and professional backgrounds. To sum up, the OPT extension program should be and will be passed!!
