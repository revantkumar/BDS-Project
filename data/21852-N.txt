This is the United States. A government meant to serve it's people not give preferences to non citizens. Our government should be ashamed of the double standards it uses. We have laws for hiring and minimum wage for a reason, yet you will allow them to be broken and in the end exploit a targeted group of people, which only accomplishes the spread of racism and inequality. What are you thinking!!!
