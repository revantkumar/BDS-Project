I strongly approves the new extension rule, it gives all the international student more opportunities and greater potentials in their future life! Not to mention the great economical benefit this extension will bring to the United States.

I am a graduate international student studying at University of Connecticut. The extension of OPT is really important for us who own an American dream. With the extension, we may have more times to work and get the real world training we need, and this will greatly increase our potentials when we go back to our home country!! Please make it the new rule as soon as possible!
