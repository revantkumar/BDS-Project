This is not about saving our jobs. This is about not letting our education resource to compete against us. Our country attributes its technology advantage over others to a lot of immigrates. This is what the history has shown us and I think this still holds true. We need those STEM students around to work for OUR economy, not against. If we believe in our college education system, we should let those graduates stay and work legally. Numerous students (especially those with advanced degrees) from technology section are backbones of a lot of promising startups. Helping those startup grow also helps our economy grow.
