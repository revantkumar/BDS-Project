It seems that F-1 students are getting a huge benefits, but the biggest beneficiary of studying abroad is never the students, but the country who have those students. Countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia are actively instituting new strategies to attract international students. 
Take Canada as the example, it has realized that international students are useful helper to compete in the global race for research talent. According to official reports, Canada modified its Post-Graduation Work Permit Program in April, 2008, to allow international students who have graduated from a recognized Canadian post-secondary institution to stay and gain valuable post-graduate work experience for a period equal to the length of the student's study program, up to a maximum of three years, with no restrictions on type of employment. This change leads to a 64% increase in the number of post-graduation work permits issued to international students in 2008. By 2014, the number of internationalstudents in the program more than doubled its 2008 total. These stats are not only meaningless numbers, but a huge potential power to make Canada's economy prosper and be inspired by new ideas.
