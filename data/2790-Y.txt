I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.

I) STEM students are more capable to make contributions to the country using what they have learned from U.S. universities.

II) International students may bring some competition, but will also fill the vacancies that are not suitable for others. That means the comprehensive improvement and social progress.

III) Diversity and respect are key values in U.S. society, noting that a lot of successful people were once international students.
