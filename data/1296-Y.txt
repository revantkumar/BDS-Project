I strongly support the decision of expanding the OPT extension to 24 months instead of 17 months. International students want to get working experience of American companies after graduation in US. Many International students pay a lot of tuition in American Universities. These tuition fee are an essential part of American revenue every day. If the decision of expanding the OPT extension to 24 months, it will attract more stem International students to study in American, they will bring more tuition fee to American. What' s more, stem students especially cs and ece make contribution to American companies, it will benefit to American economy. So, I hope this rule can be approved as soon as possible.
