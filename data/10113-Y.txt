24 months extension? Not a bad start. In fact, US need to send green cards to these PhDs right away. If these PhDs choose to go back to their home country like China, Russia, Iran. You know, US will be in big trouble. Do I need to remind you who helped to make the A bomb in China? Yes, USA trained PhD. Do they need to bring anything back to China. No! Everything is in their brain. USA is a great nation, but, right now, others are not bad either. If people cannot stay, they know what to do. US is allowing illegal immigrants to get in freely, and is training these PhDs with US money and send them back? Think harder!
