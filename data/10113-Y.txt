Wenyan Zhou I strongly support this new OPT extension rule for the following reasons:
1. Many projects in the company would last for more than one year, if the international students don't have the OPT extension and lose their VISA, many projects will be suspended or abolished.
2.US needs the diversity and diversity will inspire the creation of sparks to promote the industry.
3. As for me, I am a Chinese and my parents live in China. I will definitely be back to China.If I have 3 years experience working in US, it will help me to find a better job when back to China.
The new OPT extension rule will benefit both US high-tech industry and international STEM talents
