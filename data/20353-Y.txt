I am absolutely agree expand OPT for F-1 students. On the one hand, thousands and handreds of companies in different fields accross the US are hiring F-1 student with their OPT. Cancle the extention will must lead a lot of loss for both those companies and the government. Those students are hold extremly large passion on sacrefied themself for this beautiful country with high-tech skills and great intelligence. By expanding OPT, the relationship with other countries government will be better because their students get more opportunities in the US and the GDP in US will also growth fase by there help. This definetely a win-win proposal!
