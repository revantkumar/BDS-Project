I support the extension of OPT. 
First, the OPT extension will not affect the job opportunities for American. For companies hiring employee, they will first consider American not foreign students unless foreign students have higher quality. Most of the foreign students are at technology companies.
Second, if the technology companies cannot hire enough workers with high quality, they will come to India and China and transfer its business. This will cause more lost on tax. 
Third, OPT extension will attract millions of foreign students come to USA for education, Most of them pay their tuition and living expense by themselves. For this reason students parent will visit them sometime and this benefit american thousands of industries like tourism, food, car and others. This will in turn benefit native students.
