Young people lives matter, the more we can help them, the more educated they become the more we all will benefit as a society. Having immigrated to this country myself I know the importance and benefit of a higher education. I believe I have served the community with my work. My aim has been to help others deal with their problems so that they can be contributing members of society. My aim has been to bring out the best in people, so that in turn they can impact positively others in their work, their families and communities. I believe this same benefit needs to be afforded to these young men and women.
