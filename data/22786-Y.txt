Now the H1 lottery makes talented students working in the US much harder than before, because of abusing H1 visa. It decreases the opportunity for OPT student continuing working for this country, and it also weakens the opportunity of native American's opportunity in turn. Extending OPT is good way to keep talent and a much more fair way for F1 student. I totally support to extension of OPT and hope it could be longer. H1 lottery shouldn't exist if there is real qualified worker, and they should get the visa immediately, not the one who abuses working visa.
