I strongly support this new rule, here is my reason.

I read some opposed comments and most of them are considering the job competition between the international students and American students. Some emphasize the difference of the new hires number. From the number, we may have the feeling that company prefer to hire international students. 

However, do they also give the total number of STEM students on these 2 sides also? We should not concentrate on the number they hire, but on the percentage. From my own experience, our electrical engineering class has very few American students but they can still find the job easily as same as we are. 

Also, from the view of the company, American students are more likely to have a longer and much more stable status to make effort and contribution for the company. International students will be restricted on their visa and may leave company sooner or later. Company also need to spend money to support the H1B lottery of international students. But why they still hire so many international students? That is because the number of American graduates are far from reaching the need of the company's development. Consider the bad impact on the high-tech companies if they cannot find enough human resources to development themselves. 

Based on the options above, I do support this new rule.
