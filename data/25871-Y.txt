OPT STEM extends to 24months can absolutely make more benefits to the US. Those students who are qualified to a job position should not be rejected by the company only because they need working visa in the US. Especially for those companies not willing to sponsor H1B working visa, they typically will not select those applicants who need sponsorship. If the OPT STEM can have 24months, more students can get their career started based on what they learned in the school, improving more hands-on experience, and also make more contribution to the company. This is a win-win!!
