I am stunned and amazed that Homeland Security is pushing for new rules that would in effect help foreign students get training to fill technical positions over American students when the US is in an employment crisis!! We have already opened our borders to a flood of illegals who are taking positions that could be filled by Americans, but now these Homeland Security fools want to use tax payer money to educate foreigners who dont have the skills needed to fill tech positions? Has it not occurred to these fools to offer this training to American students? I personally know many young people who cannot afford further schooling who would jump at the chance to get government funding to train for careers that would enrich our nation, and these nitwits at Homeland want to train foreigners with my tax dollars? DO NOT DO THIS!This ridiculous even by Federal standards and that is saying something!
