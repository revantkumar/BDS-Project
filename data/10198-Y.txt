As an international student studying in US, I see it as a great opportunity to gain working experience and work my way up in a company. Yes, there are many companies offers job opportunities for international student to complete OPT. However, I also have heard many times from all types companies that they do not hire international students because we are not able to stay in their company long enough and worth the training period. Making the OPT period longer is definitely great for us to gain more job opportunities and experience.
