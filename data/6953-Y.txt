Strongly support this proposal, have read a lot comments before post this, people who opposed it mostly were trying to avoid competition with those international students, but wake up, the ONLY correct way to get a job is KEEP LEARN AND IMPROVE YOURSELF everyday, not to expel those students, especially they are making contribution to this country.

U.S is a great country, because we never afraid of competition, and with competition we do better. If you are lazy to improve yourself but want to get a decent job, sorry, it is not American Spirit. If we have to expel those skilled students to help our citizen get a job, I will be ashamed.

Let those students stay to create more values, event startup companies, offer more jobs, this is the right way to help others get a job and keep U.S being great.
