I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Diversity is very important for the U.S. In the history, many talent people coming U.S from their country for the better living, researching and learning environment. Not only they brought knowledge, research results, creative ideas, but they also creative lots of opportunity for America as well as the world. 

2. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Help people in U.S work harder and more efficient in all business. 

3. One cannot disagree that we should give international graduates has enough time, to let them keep making contributions to the U.S society.
