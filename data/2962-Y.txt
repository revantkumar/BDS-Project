SUPPORTING the proposal without any doubt. The reasons are below:
1. Students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country would know more by working. This is committed by students entering the universities.

2. Without this, many students may choose UK, Australia and other countries rather than US, we will lose lots of talent students.

3. Our companies have lots of experienced engineers and workers using the OPT. If we stop it, the result would be will bad.
