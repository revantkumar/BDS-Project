The blossom of US technology and economy has always been boosted by immigrations of highly skilled and well educated individuals from diverse backgrounds. The OPT extension proposal here enables those who receive at least a US entitled Bachelor's degree in STEM field to stay here and continue to contribute to the goodness of the country for a substantial amount of time.

Especially, those with advanced degrees such PhDs are the leading force in research and technology innovation. What is the purpose of driving them back?
