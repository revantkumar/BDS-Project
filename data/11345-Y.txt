I think it is really beneficial for both America and the international students to extend the opt time, for that:

1. The international students have the required ability and skills to fulfill the huge human resource shortage in American industry, especially the Internet industry. It is really obvious that the country do need the international students to work for American companies for at least several years, because in fact there are not too many American students willing to study and have their career in STEM. I've heard about some survey that only one third of American high school students want to have their career in such fields like STEM, most them aim to become lawyers, doctors and financialists. So it's very important for America to have these international students to work as engineers.

2. Nowadays, much more international students will return to their home country eventually. So it is completely unnecessary for some racialists to concern about our immigrantion tendency. Take myself as an example, I am a Chinese and now study engineering in UPenn. In fact, I have no plan to spend too much time working in America. I think I will return to Shanghai after the end of my opt. In fact, the main reason that I want to work in America for the 29 or 36 months is that I just want to have some working experience in a different culture.
