I am strongly convince that improving and expanding training opportunities for F1 students will not only providing highly qualified work labors but also create more job opportunities for United States' citizens in the long term.

I believe most of F1 students who could find jobs in United States are highly qualified for following reasons. Firstly, not all companies are willing to do H1B work for their employees and from my observation. Companies that only need common people to do common work would prefer not to sponsor this because that would be a big cost for them, which means F1 students who could find jobs here in United States are usually more competitive than others. And secondly, from my knowledge, because of the restriction during H1B period, F1 graduates tend to be more loyal to their employers.

And also I believe that the extension for STEM students would create more job opportunities for United States' citizens. From the data of H1b, we could find that a large number of them works for IT industry. As we all know, many of IT companies create more jobs for common people like Uber and Airbnb. Also, another feature of IT industry is that customers would not care much about where the product was made. In other words, if many F1 student, who could have stayed here and improved many companies competence, went back to their country or to other countries, some companied from other countries might grow and get the cake from companies in United States (with their lower labor cost and relatively worse but still qualified product).

In conclusion, although some people are concerned that F1 students would "rob" their jobs, but I believe this is shortsighted and the extension would only contribute to a healthier job market and United States' prosperity.
