Ting Ye Hi Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,

Thank you very much for giving me this chance to make some comments for the consideration of improving and expanding training opportunities. I think it is a very good method to benefit U.S. a lot. Here is my thought:

1. Study

As what we can see obviously, international students contribute to the economy of U.S. a lot. The current plan can boost more foreign students to come to U.S., since they can have much more time and chances to get work experience here. Some countries don't have so much benefit for international students, which will make them less attractive(comparing with U.S.).

2. Industry

If more excellent international students stay here, the STEM industries can get more power from them. Even "one student one more year" makes large differences.

3. Politics

The students who stay longer in U.S. to work know more about this country. This will reduce the cost of many fields, such as diplomacy, international trade, and industrial communication.

So, my thought has been post above. Thank you very much for giving me this chance again!

Sincerely,

Ting Ye
