I strongly agree with the extension. STEM extension is not related to all jobs. It only related to science and technology, engineering and mathematics. In order for the United States to be a leader in the world, it has to have more diverse ideas in these areas and also have many excellent people in these fields. OPT extension is helpful to collect more ideas and make excellent people stay at the U.S.
