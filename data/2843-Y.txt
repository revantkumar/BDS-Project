It is a hard time for people to find job nowadays, but it is not caused by international students. Brilliant minds from all over the world come to the US to study then make their contributions to the society. The international student community especially STEM students have been significantly improving the productivity and competitiveness of US companies and organizations among the rest of the world thus resulted in more US citizens getting hired. International STEM student community is comprised with small number of population compare with Americans who possess negative opinions on this OPT extension proposal. Therefore people cannot ignore the fact that even though 10% of Americans reject the proposal will caused the comments overwhelmed by negative opinions and the rest of the 90% remain silence because they might not even knowing the proposed rule. Please think rationally to figure out what has caused such hardness in job market and don't aim and harm wrong targets which will make US less competitive then more people lose their jobs. There are many non-immigrant nations having far more severe economical issues, please don't blame STEM student, they didn't make the job market like this. On the contrary, they are trying to preserve the advanced technological position US now is in.
