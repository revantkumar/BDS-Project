I think this policy will benefit the economy of the USA a lot. These STEM students are valuable to the US and will make contributions to the US. Looking at these negative comments above, I'm pretty sure a lot of them are left by other country officials who don't want their good students to stay in the US. It's a big loss for them, lol!
