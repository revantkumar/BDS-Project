Anonymous If blue-collar Americans are forced to compete with illegal (euphemistically, undocumented) aliens and we import college-educated foreign talent from third world countries to undercut the salaries of American-born graduates, when and where will the race to the bottom end? I guess with a lot of unemployed and underemployed people. Maybe, the American dream will be found somewhere else in the world. Maybe, we'll have a brain-drain from our own country.
