How does the proposed law affect current international students that are on F1-OPT visa (on F1-OPT STEM extension for 17 months). I am one such student and my F1-STEM OPT extension, EAD work authorization expires on 24th December 2015. Can I apply to get work authorization for another additional seven months, once this becomes a law ?
