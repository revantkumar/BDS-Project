It's so good hear this quick action, as one of those working on a OPT F1 visa, I was really nervous about my career. I am sure this action will benifit both companies and STEM students once it gets approved. As a matter of fact, the hiring market in US need more STEM employees currently and in the future, I am sure the prolong of STEM extension period is a thoughtful, reasonable move for the Bureau to stand up for the continuous development of the States's science and technology industry, it's also a smart action for US economy.
