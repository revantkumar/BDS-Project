The new OPT extension program should be approved as it ultimately benefits the United States. First, the policy draws more skilled and talented students from abroad to keep United States as the center of the most advanced technological center in the world. Second, because of more workers coming, there will be more tax paid each year to the government. Since the students are not U.S. Citizens, the tax paid by the working students will ultimately benefit the citizens of United States. So I stand for the approval of this policy to benefit the United States.
