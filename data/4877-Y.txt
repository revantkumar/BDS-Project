I do support this extension. 

I have 3 reasons:
1. OPT STEM rule will benefit U.S. technology companies. Companies need to spend months to train new employees. If there is no extended OPT STEM rule, companies have to find a replacement in a year. So do the math, companies pay a large amount of money and time on training those students, and have to see them leave before they profit.
2. OPT STEM rule is good for US economy because talented foreign people contribute to US technology and economy. Moreover, the extended OPT will attract more talented people to come to US to study. So do the match again, $10,000 tuition for each student, how much US is gonna get for attracting foreign students to study, and that doesn't even include daily expenses and stuff. 

3. It's American spirit to give everyone equal chance, and it's unfair to limit talented foreign students in working in US.
