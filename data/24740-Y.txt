I highly support this proposal. Every talented and passionate young professional deserves this extended opportunity. 
If I am an employer, I would like to find the best fit from a bigger pool of qualified candidates. If I have a good employee who isn't lucky enough to win the H1B visa in his/her first year, I want to give him/her a second chance. 
With this proposal coming into effect, both the employees and employers will see the benefits and the difference it makes.
