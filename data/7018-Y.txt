I strongly support enhancing the opportunities for f1 students by increasing stem opt and I also strongly suggest to increase the stem opt to 36 months instead of 24 months because the international students come all over the world to America to study in the best schools in the world and also to get the working exposure by opt . If the stem opt is not enough it doesn't make sense for a student coming all the way here and spending a lot of money because as a student from a middle class family I know how hard to pay the tuition.so I think the opt should be 36 months which can help the student as well as the countries economy.
