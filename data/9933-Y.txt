I am in support of the amended regulations based on several facts as follows:

First off, International F1 STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) students are boosting the US economy instead of harming it. These students take positions WITH NO AMERICAN REPLACEMENTS AVAILABLE in cutting-edge fields such as IT, engineering, math, physics that have been creating THOUSANDS OF JOBS annually. F1 STEM students are GOOD for the US.

Second, OPT extension is offering the F1 STEM students a practicum period for them to do good to the US economy, to help the companies in the STEM field who are unable to hire enough people with the required skills. In this sense, the OPT extension is helping these companies which play a critical role in the US economy.

Last but not the least, the US is a great nation in the sense that it is created by talented and hardworking people of different country origin, race/ethnicity, and religious beliefs. The F1 STEM students are among these kinds of people who came to the US to make it a greater nation by fulfilling their own American Dreams. These students came here with unique skill sets and enthusiastic minds. Denying a chance for them to practice their skills and contribute to the economy will not do any good but harm to the US people. The US nation will be less and less competitive in the globalization happening in the 21st century.
