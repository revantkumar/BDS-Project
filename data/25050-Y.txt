Optional Practical Training (OPT) is totally good idea. It provide business contacts to other markets, enhancing America's ability to trade and invest profitably in the global economy. They keep our economy flexible, allowing U.S. producers to keep prices down and to respond to changing consumer demands.

Other countries would criticize our OPT rule, as we " steal " their jobs and their talented people who have been trained by their countries for so many years, who finally contribute to our countries and our peoples. Our people would applause it. 

This is definitely good thing.
