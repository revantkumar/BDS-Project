I strongly support this proposed rule since it brings more benefits for united states. As far as I know, most tech companies are trying to hire people with strong technical skills. A lot international students with STEM degree match those tech companies hiring requirements. If more US citizens have matched technical skills or background, I believe that tech companies will prefer hiring them instead of international students. But the point is, most US citizens are more active in other industry instead of high tech industry. Meanwhile, international students are not only making contributions to tech industry, but also IRS which will distribute tax income to benefit US citizens. 
To sum up, I think this proposed rule should be passed!
