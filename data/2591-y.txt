Zheng Cui I strongly SUPPORT this OPT extension for STEM students. 

The reason is not on the side of me, but the country.

For me, it provides me longer time to work here. I can devote myself to this country that gives me such a precious opportunity to lean the knowledge I'm interested in. 

For the country, a huge amount of money has been applied to cultivate high lever student. If they do not make any contribute to U.S. It would be a huge loss to the government.
