Ad an engineering student, I strongly encourage the 24 months OPT extension, my reasons including,

1. America is an immigration country, people should not be too criticized about the other people's willing to work in the USA.
2. As the engineering industry are developing very fast and the high needs for educated technical employees, the 24 months OPT extension definitely will help with American industry development and offers even more jobs for people.
3. If the educated technical persons are worried about their immigration status too much, they will seek jobs in other countries, and that is a loss to the US science and technical development.
4. The students are working very hard which pushes the US economy forward.
