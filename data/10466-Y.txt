I'll consider OPT as an valuable opportunity for both companies and international students. For companies, they are able hire more talented student, contributing to development of science, technology and arts. It's benefiting all human beings. For students, longer OPT period will enable them to focus more on their work, instead of worrying about their visa problems. It is a win-win situation.
