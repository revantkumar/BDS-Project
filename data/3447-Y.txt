Okay first of all these students learnt knowledge from the US universities and colleges, why not let them make more contributions to the US first after graduation? And with this policy obviously the universities and colleges in the US can attract more students than the other countries like the UK or Canada - that's an obvious profit for the education. Yeah the last thing, everyone is equal. You have skills, you gain more.
