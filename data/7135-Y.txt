Being a manager in an Banking giant, I can strongly vouch for the STEM extension. People who get advanced degrees in Engineering and Mathematics are able to fill quite a lot of important positions in the firm which would otherwise remain empty or having to be filled with under qualified people. The extension would ensure that the participant has a motive to remain for some more time and help the organization grow.
