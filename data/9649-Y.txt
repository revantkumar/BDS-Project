I believe an extension to this program would be beneficial. In order for American companies to continue to be able to compete in a global environment, it is critical that we retain as many skilled and educated workers as possible, both domestic and foreign born. By creating a longer extension period, we can help ensure companies to have access to as many talented candidates as possible.

Additionally, this could help alleviate the significant worker shortage that some STEM jobs are experiencing.
