I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1 This benefits both the education industry in US and science and technology industry. OPT is one of most attractive reason for students choose to come to US for their study, without it many students may choose other country which provide better opportunity. And this will cause great lost of income for many universities and some education peripheral industries. The income from international students can benefits both universities and native students. Besides, great amount of international students can bring some peripheral industries around university, such as restaurants, house renting, etc. which will providing more job opportunity.

2 OPT is kind program that can make the international students continue to contribute to US using the knowledge they learn from here. Most international students are very talent in their studying area, and with their effort, it will create benefits the developing of the since and technology industry of US. So in other words, they do not take the job opportunities from native students, on the contrary, with fast developing of those industry, companies can provide more opportunities which will also benefits the native students.
