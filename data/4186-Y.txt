I strongly support this policy.
First, America is free land with freedom spirit. Anyone has equal chance, study here, work here, live here. Everyone has a hard time in a completely new environment, so international students need time to suit.
Second, there is no obviously differences between America and any other countries people on this world. Many international students already show their brilliant thought in the areas they work.
Third, International students also help economic development, and create more job opportunities.
So America should accept different culture and we can work together to make America better!
