Stella Wang I strongly support this new STEM OPT extension Rule. This rule will give more opportunities for students to enhance their practical skills, which will benefit US companies a lot by having more capable graduates working for them. This will in turn boost the overall economy in US. Also, a fair competition environment is the essential for the society to develop.
