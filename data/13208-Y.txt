I strongly believe this is a good decision. 
1) Extending the STEM OPT will allow more well educated foreign students work for US companies, which will strengthen the competitiveness of such companies. 
2) Such STEM students get high salary and mostly are doing high-tech jobs in areas like engineering, mathematics and science. They are not cheap labor but high-end intellectuals, which will contribute to US society a lot.
3) It's more difficult for foreigners to find a job and more troublesome to hire a foreign student for employers. Employers usually hire citizens first. Usually after there is no enough local labor on the market, do the employers start to hire foreigners. This policy is not likely to make citizens harder to find a job.
