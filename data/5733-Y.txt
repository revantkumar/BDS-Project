I strongly support the OPT extension policy. First of all, many objection voices come from the conclusion that US already has enough qualified employees right now so they don't need more new fresh faces. However they neglected one fact that this is based on a large amount of employees already in the OPT position who are waiting for winning a luck in H1B lottery. By abandoning the extension, the company could lose many well-trained workers while the short 12-month will be hard for any employer to give a correction evaluation of the new people. In this case, human resources loss will be unavoidable in the near future in most STEM field. Secondly OPT extension provides US education an absolute priority for study abroad. As we all know, the financial contribution from international students largely help the education of local American students. Without this policy, I believe the amount of international students will be significantly reduced, which will be a big loss for US eventually. Last but definitely not the least, US is known as a melting pot, which allows the development of various culture. The OPT extension policy obeys this origin and provides chances and hopes for every new curious face coming to USA to achieve the dreams. I agree that problem of unemployment is challenging for US government, but definitely it won't be fully solved by decreasing the amount of international workers. The OPT extension will bring more advantages from long-term consideration.
