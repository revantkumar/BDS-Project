I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:
1. STEM related jobs are important to America's development especially in hi-tech fields. Therefor, expanding opportunities for F1 students makes US companies more powerful with such good employees.
2. It's good for US economy to have talented foreign people work in IT area.
3. It's good for US education since longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in US.
