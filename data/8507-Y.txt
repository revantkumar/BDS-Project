OPT extension for STEM degree students is very important to us. As an international student who will graduate with a EE master degree soon, I really worried about my future in USA. I love my own country very much, but I like Houston too, like my second hometown. More importantly, I have been diagnosed as Multiple Sclerosis several month ago and I really need the medicine in USA. That is the reason make me longing for an opportunity to work here. I know not everyone with the same reason like me. However, many international students have their own reason to desire a work opportunity here. The extension give us more chances to stay in USA. And I believe USA need and want us to be part of the strength who can help USA be a better country.
