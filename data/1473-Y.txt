I think it is shortsighted to deprive international students' right to work in US simply because they are not citizens. As we all know, international students bring huge amount of money to America, which helps so many universities to earn money. Moreover, they help increase income of other segments, like retailing, tourism, and rag trade, which in turn creates a lot of jobs for citizens. If international students are forbidden to work in US, there will be less and less international students willing to study in American for undergraduate or graduate degree. They will turn to other countries that have more attractive policies to them, such as Australia, Canada, and England. If this circumstances happens, not only the universities will be faced with a huge loss, the whole education industry, or even all industries mentioned above, will be influenced a lot.
