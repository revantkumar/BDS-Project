Dear Mr. Johnson:

I write to you regarding the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. 

America needs STEM talent for future development, and STEM students are the key to it, as they possess the latest up-to-date state of the art technology knowledge. It also happens that 80% othe STEM students are foreigners, and so, we have to extend their time of residence so that America can be benefited,

Extend OPT extension period for 48 months rather than 24 months.
