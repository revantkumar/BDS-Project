I don't understand why people feel uncomfortable with this rule. This rule simply gives foreign students a chance to compete with American workers, not a guarantee to work. For those who believe foreign students take American workers' jobs, why are you afraid of competition? American workers have unlimited chance to compete by nature, and now some of them want a guarantee by getting rid of foreigners. I smell discrimination. And I have never seen a qualified but unemployed American engineer. So stop dreaming and learn skills.
