I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:
1. Since the federal government let the international students study at U.S., many of them can make great contributions to the university, the local community and even the entire country.
2.Diversity really means a lot to the entire country, not only the higher educations. As the country which accept people from every difficult background and has the leading technologies in the world, the government should give bonus support to the STEM students. Also, there are many famous people who contribute a lot to U.S with the previous STEM student background.
3. Students who are in the STEM major, almost every one did not "rub" the jobs from domestic people, it is because these kinds of jobs need appropriate technology background and the recruiter cannot find domestic people who fit these jobs. Furthermore, competition in the technology field is not a bad thing, if U.S. does not want competition, it cannot has such a leading role in the world and other countries will surpass U.S. So it is necessary to have people, especially to make the domestic people to compete with the people all around the world, to make them become more competitive, in order to serve the whole country gain more competitiveness in the technology field.
