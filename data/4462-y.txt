wei cao I strongly support this rule.
I am a postdoc working in one of the Department of Energy's national lab. As far as I know, a significant part of the employees here are foreigners that just got their PhD degree. Thus they pretty much all hold OPT. By the time their OPT expires, they just learned the necessary skills to conduct cutting edge researches. In order to perform high quality research, an OPT extension is a prerequisite. Without the OPT extension, I do not see how possible it is to get enough US people or green card holders to fill up those spots that require almost a decade's high education level training. It is just a great loss for US to cut out the numerous talented engineers and scientists.
