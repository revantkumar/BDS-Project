Ketan Jani I am in complete favor of Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. International students with F-1 status absolutely need training opportunities, and extension for students with STEM degrees is must!
