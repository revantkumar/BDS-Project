I really hope the 24-month stem opt will be approved. In order to study in America, I spent a lot of time in GRE and Toefl, and finally I got the admission in US to study for a few years. At the end of this April, I got a job in US, and just started to have a chance to know the world-class industry. Thanks to OPT, and I got the permission to work here. I really wish this time can be longer for me to get more experiences. I fully support this rule to improve and expand training opportunities for F1 Stem OPT. Thank you very much!
