Most of working positions in STEM category are technical positions. Therefore, it usually takes at least six months, and most commonly one year to get familiar with the position before making good contribution at this position. If OPT is only one year, it is a great waste for companies to invest their budget and time to train a new grad, since at the time the new employee can make a good productivity, their visa status don't allow them to return to companies. 

Besides, students in STEM are still in great demand that native students number is not enough to satisfy. Therefore, in companies' perspective, it is only worthwhile to hire a new grad who could work for them for at least two or three years to make enough contributions to companies, and this is one of many reasons that OPT should be extended to 36 months in total.
