I strongly support this rule, for apparently the benefits greatly outweighs its disadvantages. 

As for the opposing opinion that nonimmigrant students"take jobs away", it is nonsense to say that the total amount of job opportunities are strictly settled. Those who are able to find jobs and stay in US are often the most innovative ones, and they actually play an important role in developing new products and improving the whole industry, which creates more job opportunities.

Moreover, the percentage of international students in top 50 us universities are more than 10%. Why do we provide them with best resources and education just to send them back to be our strong competitors? Now that they are already here, already "taking away" the resources of American students, what we need to think about is how they can benefit US. The beneficial way is apparently not sending them back, but letting them stay and contribute to US economy. If there's ever a need to complain about too many nonimmigrant students in STEM, complain to college admission officers. Nothing here is about job, since though the foreign STEM job-seekers were indeed consumers when they were college students, they are producers and innovators NOW. US is not a charity, we need them to contribute after years of educating them. And this rule is exactly the way to do it.
