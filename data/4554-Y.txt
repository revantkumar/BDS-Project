I support this new rule. The new rule will help the United States retain more high skilled STEM workers, especially in the high-tech industry. It's good for the U.S. economy. Furthermore, international students tuition is good fund resource for universities. If this new rule passed, more and more international students will be willing to study here, and pay the tuition.

The competition between international students and U.S. citizens in the job market is not a bad thing. Generally, it is much more harder for an international student to find a job than a U.S citizen, because there are a lot of restrictions. The competition in the end will create more excellent U.S. workers.
