I strongly support OPT extension for it's beneficial both to foreign students and US society. 

In some of the opposing comments, it has been repeatedly mentioned that OPT extension brings more immigrants into the country. This absolutely NOT TRUE.


Im a Chinese student studying applied statistics in the US. For me, OPT extension definitely DOES NOT EQUAl more immigration opportunity. China with its thriving economy is very attractive for young professionals like myself, not to mention getting a job in our home country means living much closer to my dear family and friends. However as STEM students we need to be trained in practice, to gain professional experience and most of all, obtain a global perspective, which I consider to be the major purpose of OPT. OPT makes it possible for us foreign students to come back to our home country fully trained as field professionals. The culture and language experience we gained while working here in the US also opens the door for future collaboration between countries. 

In a word, OPT extension lead to more young experts with a global perspective in the field of STEM, which in the long term is obviously beneficial to the US society. Opposing the extension for the hatred towards possible immigrant shortsighted, and is a sign of nonconfidence.
