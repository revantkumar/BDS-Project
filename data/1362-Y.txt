Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Non-immigrant Students With STEM Degrees are amazing. There are more educated, skilled foreigners have chance work for United Stats. Some Americans said that foreigners take their jobs. If they do some research, this is not really true. STEM Degrees are most science and engineering major in the university, if you go to take an engineering or science lecture in the university. You will find your most classmates are foreigners because those major are harder to learn and related works are also not easy. But as a foreigner, they only have qualify for those jobs.
