There is no need to create more opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students because there is no shortage of STEM workers in the United States. The following quote emphasizes this point. 

--Over the past two decades, lobbying and public relations efforts to convince U.S. political elites that the country faces damaging and widespread shortages in its critical science and engineering workforce can only be described as stunning successes, according to Michael S. Teitelbaum, a senior research associate at Harvard Law School. In his recently published book, Falling Behind: Boom, Bust & the Global Race for Scientific Talent, Teitelbaum says, This apparently broad consensus prevails notwithstanding almost universal inability by objective labor market analysis to find any convincing empirical evidence to confirm the existence of such generalized shortages."--

As this highly credible source indicates there is no shortage of STEM workers in the United States. It is nothing but a fabricated lie by business owners so that they can import foreign workers and drive wages down. As so many recent articles have stated STEM wages our basically stagnant. I am living proof of this. I started with a software company in February of 2010 and have not received a pay raise since that time. From what I can gather very few of my colleagues have either. When we recruit for interns there is no shortage of applicants and we basically get to hire whomever we want to. From this group of interns, full time job opportunities are extended upon graduation from college.

Also, if there was such a shortage of STEM workers then why aren't outrageous salaries being offered to STEM workers with huge signing bonuses. I don't know of one instance where this has happened. In summary, this idea that there is a shortage of STEM workers is a big lie from business owners.
