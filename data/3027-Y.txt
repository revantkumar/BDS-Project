I totally agree with and support the STEM extension. Now that H1B lottery is tough, this is essential for U.S. to attract international students to work in U.S. and thus making the STEM competitive worldwide.

Apart from that, I have a friend studying in public health but it's not included in STEM list. This is unfair and unreasonable to those students. They are equipped with a strong capability in statistics and medical science, but the major in not included in STEM which has science and maths in it? I believe there're some mis-understanding here, and please make it fair and make it right.

Thanks!
