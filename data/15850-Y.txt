US should not extend STEM OPT. Indeed, it should reduce H1 CAP as well since right now US labor participation rate is at record low. I don't see the point of trying to keep so many immigrants while we have slow job creation rate. 

Please revoke such proposal and impose stricter policy on F1 OPT and H1b working visa.
