Michael Zhang When the time I decide where to go for my graduate study four years ago, US was my top choice not merely because it has one the best education systems, but also my own American dream that guided me to establish own career and family in this land built by intelligent and industrious immigrants. Now I am proud that I finished my graduate study and work as an engineer addressing the most challenging problem facing our world - renewable energy systems. I love my career as well as the people and the culture in this country, which makes me decide to devote all my life in this friendly and beautiful land. However, this is unlikely to happen if the OPT extension expires and ten of thousand of excellent foreign students, who have their own American dreams, have to face the situation of going back.

Please don't let parochialism blemish the foundation of the great country. Please don't make protection harms the American dream of talents from around the world. Thank you!
