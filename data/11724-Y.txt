I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. High tech companies is one of the most important industry of U.S. STEM students makes a large contributions on this field.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. Since it's a country has nice immigration policies. To be honest, everyone except indians in the United States is a immigrates. Right now, more and more countries changed their immigration policies and welcome international students stay in their country. Such as Canada and Australia, more and more international student choose to study in those two countries because they can easily become permanent residents in those countries. So for a potential student, immigration policies is one thing they will consider when they choose which country they should go for their future. We all know international student bring a lot of funds to the U.S. universities. Since the tuition in the U.S university is increasing, if we lose those international students then tuition for the domestic student will crazily increase. 

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. First of all, international is not able to work on a position that company can easily find an American to replace. Companies also need to pay a large amount of money in order to find a lawyer to process the H1B visa. So in many circumstances, companies usually prefer people with U.S citizenship or Green Card holders. Competitions can help improve abilities of employees and let them provide more profits to the company.
