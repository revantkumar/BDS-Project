Chunliang Lu I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. This rule is crucial for keeping foreign talents in US. I'm an international Materials science PhD student from China. Before I came to US, I had a few options to purse my PhD degree in US, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. BTW, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Dow, Dupont, G.E., Google, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents.
