Innovation is the foundation of long term strong economic of the States. The history has proven that the country thrived with skilled immigrant joining our innovation research and production. Giving the 24 months extension on OPT will ensure those high quality STEM students have motivation and enough time to obtain H1B working visa to contribute to the economic. Their contribution is not only important to the STEM industry but also to the whole country. Other industry will not thrived without innovation from the STEM related research. Forcing the STEM graduates back to their own country will delay innovation of the States and promote innovation happening in the rest of the world. It is my strong belief that attracting skilled and legal immigrants is the fundamental interest of people living in the States.
