I support OPT because OPT is good both for the economics and development of US society. OPT has already restricted the major in STEM, which is the majors few US citizens are interested in. After the WWII, US accept many STEM major expert and student from German and European, thus we get touch to the moon and deep into the sea. Nowadays,with the challenge of the developing countries such as China,Brazil
, we should absorb the brilliant students from them to help our society develop. Furthermore,the pass of the opt will attract more students from abroad to learn in US, which will benefit the economics of the country.
