Jin Guo I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:
1Science, technology and engineering are the foundation of a country, with the 36 OPT, US will attract more talented STEM students to come to US which will benefit many high-tech companies growing healthy that keep US NO.1 in technology in the world.
2: With longer OPT, more international students would choose american college as their priority. This will bring money into education system so that those college and universities would focusing on the quality of teaching without financial problem, and it will benefit both american students and international student.
3: STEM students did not steal their jobs, they are creating jobs. one of my friend(mechanical engineering)got a job to manufacture a high performance window, he increase the efficiency of drawing but need develop a software to make it happen, so the employer hired an another students who is from computer science.
