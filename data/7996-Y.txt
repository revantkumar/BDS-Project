I strongly support this proposal. The Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. I'm pretty sure if anyone has the chance to study in those fields in the top ranked universities he or she would notice how absurd the popular opinion "foreigners are taking their opportunities to work in a fast food chain" is. In my understanding, the problem is in selecting the candidates of this OPT benefit (i.e., OPT program should only be available for students from top 50/100 US universities). Because right now a lot of foreigners are cheating to get their chance in the lottery. And I think those people might be the primary reason for some Americans to be afraid of taking their employment opportunities away.
