The subsidies to OPT for STEM workers are unfair to U.S. Workers and new graduates from college local to the U.S.
In my state, almost 20% of scholarships are now given to foreign students. My child was never afforded this subsidy.
Many of the foreign students were never required to pass the rigorous standardized tests required under 
Common Core in my state.

Foreign students should be required to pass all local math and English proficiency tests required by colleges and universities in the State which they choose to enroll. No double subsidies of scholarships and plus OPT should ever be allowed because local students are not afforded the same subsidy. As a STEM worker, I have never met non-native English-speaking foreign OPT/H1B workers who could speak English better than U.S. nationals. The vast majority of OPT and H1Bs are lacking in basic English and technical skills.

As many as 250,000 or more students graduate from U.S. colleges and technical schools and find it very competitive to find work. The market is generating around 125,000 STEM jobs annually, not nearly enough for the new graduates. The claims of labor shortages are provably false by these numbers alone. There is no need for OPT or the F1 or the H1B except in the delusions of management of corporate America.

DHS is putting a mandate on local colleges and universities who will pass along the cost to students and parents in the U.S. already strapped with high tuition costs. I should add, that along with high and rising tuition costs, I face competition from H1Bs who commit rampant degree fraud in obtaining their H1B visas. The fraud is based on the specious claim that the workers have "advanced" degrees, Southern Asian colleges call a U.S. bachelors degree a masters degree.
