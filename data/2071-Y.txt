Usain Huang I strongly SUPPORT the new OPT rule.
As a potential student in the U.S, the U.S would become less attractive if we lose the OPT extension. Having been studying in a top-notch university in my home country, I have the opportunities to pursue further education all over the world. The U.S interests me most because the OPT extension provides me enough time for professional training in big IT companies. Without the OPT extension, I would not have enough time to get enough working experiences that qualify me a professional engineer. Simply one year is far from enough for a nice project in the IT industry. If I was sent home immediately after getting my degree, why would I bother investing huge money in studying in the U.S? I want to be become a professional engineer that work in the industry field, not a professor that stay in the academia. And to be frank, the degree will not guarantee me anything, only the working experience does. 
It is disappointing that some commenters argued that the international students had brought too much competition. Everybody is clear that the job market needs competition to ensure the quality of the employees. The citizens should go sharpen their professional skills if they find it hard to land for a job in the IT industry, instead of trying to keep international talents out of their countries. Please do not try to limit the U.S companies to its "own" companies because a prosperous economy needs diversity in its working labors. And I think that the success of the U.S owed a large part to its friendly policies towards talents from all over the world. 
Hope more people support this great rule.
