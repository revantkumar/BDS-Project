It is conspicuous a stupid proposal that is intended to abolish the OPT.
First, it is not necessary to say more about the devastating consequence of removing STEM students and employees from their positions which will only deteriotate the economy in US. Everybody knows that.
Second, US is a country consititude by immigrators since its birthday. How could these people forget the spirit of freedom and justice. Are there anyone who used to be an immigrator or his/her parents are immigrators? Will you do that to yourselves or your parent when they want to live and work in US?
Third, these opponents are just not capable enough to compete with these preeminent students and employees, who just want to replace them with low-skilled workers. What a despicable means to get a job! What I see is a country that promote freedom of competition not country full of tricks and conspiracy. DO THOSE PEOPLE STILL REMEMBER THE MEANING OF THE STATUE OF LIBERTY?! Do not forget the history.
