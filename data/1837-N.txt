It is outrageous and unconscionable to accept = that the Department of Homeland Security has proposed a rule to EXPAND the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program, 

It is not acceptable to give employers financial incentives to hire foreign students and recent college graduates over Americans. The negative impact on American workers has to be taken into consideration, but more so understood. 

This program has never been authorized by Congress. Currently, foreign students who have been pursuing their degree for at least 9 months can work in the U.S. for 12 months or 29 months if pursuing a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) degree. 

This new rule would extend the program's length from 12 months to 36 months for these STEM students. The program incentives U.S. companies to hire foreign students and recent graduates because they do not have to pay the prevailing wage or their share of the 7.65% payroll taxes for the foreign worker, costing Social Security an estimated $1 billion dollars a year. Again, the NEGATIVE IMPACT ON AMERICAN WORKERS has to be taken into consideration, but more so understood.
