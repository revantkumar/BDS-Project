I strongly support this new OPT extension rule from 17 months to 24 months.

I am an international financial engineering master student from China in New York University.

When I applying for the master program, the thing that attraedct me a lot is the OPT extension of 17 month,which gives me enough time to accumulate working experience. If I have three years work experience in US, I would be more competitive in the job market of China.

What's more,DHS also recognizes that it must quickly address the imminent vacatur of the 2008 IFR, and the significant uncertainty surrounding the status of thousands of students in the United States. As of September 16, 2015, over 34,000 students were in the United States on a STEM OPT extension. In addition, hundreds of thousands of international students, most of whom are in F-1 status, have already chosen to enroll in U.S. educational institutions and are currently pursuing courses of study in fields that may provide eligibility for this program. Some of those students may have considered the opportunities offered by the STEM OPT extension when deciding whether to pursue their degree in the United States. DHS must therefore act swiftly to mitigate the uncertainty surrounding the 2008 IFR. Prompt action is particularly appropriate with respect to those students who have already committed to study in the United States, in part based on the possibility of furthering their education through an extended period of practical training in the world's leading STEM economy.

I am in the second year of master degree and I will graduate May 2016, so I am really concern about the extension of OPT.

Once again,I strongly support this new OPT extension rule from 17 months to 24 months.
