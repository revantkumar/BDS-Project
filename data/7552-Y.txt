OPT extension is beneficial to U.S. as a country. It may not necessary good for a specific people. The US development depends on contributions from non-US-citizen based on the US history. This is still the case now. And it will be the case in the future. So I think it is important to have the OPT extension for STEM majors. Those people are well educated and smart.
