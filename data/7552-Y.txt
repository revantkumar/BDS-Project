Abilash Rangoju Good move. I completely support the new proposal which facilitates students to gain some industrial experience in their respective fields.

As an international student I heavily relied on the STEM program in order to make a decision to do my masters in United States. If I could not get a relevant industrial experience, why would I consider investing thousands of dollars to pursue my studies? Thank you for continuing the program. 

I urge you to please take necessary actions to implement it before the existing rule is voided in Feb 2016.

However, I had a concern about the mandatory mentorship program. It might be very difficult for some companies especially startups to provide a mentorship program and can discourage them from hiring F-1 students altogether. Even if it is made mandatory, how do you make sure that the program is being implemented?
