I highly agree to expand training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. Those nonimmigrant students come to U.S. to learn high-tech knowledge from various fields. Even actually they bring a lot money to America during the time they study. However, high technology is much more valuable than the simple expense. Without the long enough OPT time, more and more high- tech students will go back to their own country,leaving America with nothing left. Will American students want to study CS, EE,ME and so on during one evening? It will definitely damage America economy in the long run.
