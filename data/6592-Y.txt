David Winkleman Sr This government needs to support the American worker who is seeking gainful employment, but cannot find any because illegals are filling these positions. The American worker is native citizen who will invest/support his local community and this country's economy. The illegal will send a major portion of his paycheck to family members in his/her homeland, therefore supporting their economy, not ours.
