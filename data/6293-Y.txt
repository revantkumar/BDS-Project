Manish kumar I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed 24 Months STEM OPT Extension rule.

My cousin is a great scientist and he loves to contribute to Innovation and American Economy. I don't think it's anyhow affecting American job. Moreover if they don't find the talent in U.S. they will outsource this to other country which can affect usa economy greatly. I love the proposed STEM OPT Extension Rule. I strongly support the proposed 24 months STEM OPT Extension Rule. This rule will attract great intellectual minds from all over the world to U.S and benefit its economy by providing improved and better technology in the field of medicine and technolgy.

He is an International student and STEM graduate, I like to see this rule published and implemented without adversely affecting the 1000's of Highly Skilled and Highly Motivated students in F-1 status who are contributing to U.S. Innovation, scientific discovery, technology improvements and U.S. economy.
