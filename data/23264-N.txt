As an American STEM worker, I am totally against this process. It seems to be any 'training' opportunity should first be extended to American students, not foreign students with no real ties to the United States of America. I have also seen too many Americans fired and replaced by H1 B and offshoring. 

There is no shortage of Americans interested in and qualified for STEM careers. But we are discouraged by the preference shown by companies (I am familiar with AIG). for H1 B people. Most are not particularly skilled either. But salaries are lower and the people can't easily change jobs. 

Our president and Congress keep telling us that they are working to help extend the American middle class. Apparently that is not the case based on ideas like this.
