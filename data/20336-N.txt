I'm opposed to allowing foreign students on visas to remain in the US for up to three years following their graduation. We are already providing those students with centuries of accumulated expertise in technical fields. Do we also have to allow them to take jobs away from US citizens? There appears to be little reason for a change to this policy ( i.e 3 year extension of student visa) other than to give certain corporations some financial advantages. We ought to place the needs to US employees first.

The proposed rule will destroy the job prospects of recent American STEM graduates.
The proposed rule is an assault on American middle class workers.
Expanding OPT eligibility to three years after graduation will increase the labor pool for American tech jobs by hundreds of thousands. That alone will adversely affect job opportunities and wages.
OPT provides significant financial incentives for companies to bypass American workers.
Because OPT workers are technically "students," employers will not be required to pay payroll taxes for these employees. That would save companies about $10,000 a year for each of the three years they employ OPTs.
OPT workers will not have the same rights as other workers to unionize, or to move to different employers.
OPT expansion is a blatant attempt to make an end-run around limits on H-1B visas.
