We The People, are tired of being lied to, while our current government destroys this great country. STOP the Obama administration. Do not allow any illegal entry into the U.S.A.. I support my neighbors. I support hard working people that come here legally, become a part of the American Dream while making this Country stronger. I do not support the illegals that enter by the thousands just to abuse our system.

DO NOT ALLOW businesses to hire foreign workers, or receive funding to do so.

Stop the Tidal Wave. Stop the invasion. Fix the fence & patrol it!
