I strongly support the proposal!

In order to keep the continuing competitive position of United States, it is necessary to take action to attract the greatest talents from all over the world. One of the most important ways is to attract more STEM students, make them feel welcomed and offer them more opportunities to study and make contribution to the science and tech of United States. OPT extension is an effective way to help them. OPT extension is a double-win policy which offer STEM students opportunity for practical experience as well as gaining the benefits of the work of the talents. 

Diversity is one of the reasons which helped US to become the strongest, as well as the most attractive nation in the world. Generations of immigrants infused so much fresh and energetic ideas and thoughts into the nation. As the essence of out society, diversity is worth our effort to keep. 

STEM students are potentially the most talented people in the world. They came to US with their unique yet innovative minds. Competitions do exist, but it is not completely a bad thing. Competitions help people hone their skills, preserve their positive attitude and struggle to help our nation stand in the world. In the long run the significant advance in our technology and economy will pay the price of competition. 

One practical reason is that there are a lot of OPT employees currently working in the tech industry. Once the OPT extension is deprived, they will be forced to leave their job. There will be temporarily significant loss of work forces. The jobs they are doing now will be left unattended and the employers will have a hard time to find and train new candidates. Eventually it might take years to recover and some of the companies may experience major negative impact. 

I sincerely hope OPT extension for STEM students could remain due to the aforementioned reasons.
