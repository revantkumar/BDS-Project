Y Zhao I strongly support this proposed rule. The immigrant-friendly culture is definitely one of the few things that have made US a great country. It is also one of the most important reasons why US has long been the most attractive country to work for talented people all round the world. Since great scientists like Einstein, talented immigrants have made great contribution to both this country and its people. Thus I believe it is a great decision to extent OPT to provide more opportunities for both international students and employers.
