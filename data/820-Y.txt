I SUPPORT this proposal for following reasons:

First,a fair circumstance for both U.S. students and international students to compete for STEM OPT has a great deal of potential advantages. For international students, certainly, OPT is a precious experience, for most of them will come back to their countries after finishing the study and internship in U.S. In addition, more and more international students now come to U.S. are capable enough to enroll in OPT, and they obey the rules in U.S., being one part of te society. How unfair it will be if STEM OPT for them would be shortened simply because of their nationalities but they have done nothing wrong.

Also, this proposal is equally beneficial for U.S. students. We all know that competition can turn out to be a positive catalyst for young people to learn and improve. Many international students can exactly be such catalyst. Students of excellent academic performance can gain such chances of OPT, so the competition should be fierce, but it is actually a push to U.S. students to be more hard-working. I don't mean that U.S. students are not diligent. But if our propsal allow them to have exceptional priviledge on OPT, they can choose to live with less efforts.

Third, U.S. is famous for its inclusive nature, which attracts many international students to come and study. In these years many institutions have proposed objections toward international students, pointing out that they have taken up the resources which should be used by native students. Perhaps that's the reason why this proposal receives strong objections, but I believe we should not cut the rights of current international students. They are innocents. Many of them really appreciate the chance to come to U.S. It is unfair to blame them only because their number is too much, which should be controlled by people other than themselves!

Sincerely hope you can take these factors into consideration.
