As an F-1 student on stem extension, this is a very welcome news,thank you. But ideally it would be nice if the stem extension can be extended to 36 months.

The reason for requesting 36 months is as follows:
Currently the H1B system allocates 20,000 openings for F-1 internationals with a degree in the U.S.A. Although this limit of 20,000 was sufficient 4-5 years ago, currently this does not match the application inflow. For the year of 2016 alone 240,000 applications were received.

This large demand for H1B forces students on F-1 to look for opportunities elsewhere to exhibit our skills learned here, causing lot of difficulties for the students and the employers who have to react to such relocation.
