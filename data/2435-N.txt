I oppose the Optional Practical Training program. I don't believe that companies can't find the employees they need in this country. They have a duty to hire within this country and if there are not enough qualified people then they need to work with area schools to make sure the programs and training are in place to get what they need. They must work within the communities that they are based to get what they need. Going outside the country will hurt Americans going to school and looking for work. 

This is the easy way out for these companies. By expanding guest worker programs you allow these companies to get cheaper labor and restrict employment for our citizens. I urge you to pull this proposal completely.
