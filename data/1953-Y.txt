Actually non-citizens(international students) are not better treated. I'm a master student of Geographical Information Science. I have seen so many companies and local governments looking for a GIS student which is for local resident only. I thought it will just pick the best qualified person no matter whether he is citizen or not. Most of my Chinese classmates plan to go back to China for further career development. They could only be more competitive unless they have experienced enough here. Apparently one year's OPT session is not enough. 

Hence I strongly support this proposal to have an extended 24-month OPT session for the international students.
