ziyang zhang I strongly support this rule.
First, the OPT will attract more students coming to study in US, which can be good for US economy because the international students pay more tuition and consume more.
Second, the it is good for US economy to have talent foreign student working in US. We all know that the Indian and Chinese IT bussiness is very prosperous.
At last and most improtant, the spirit of American is to give everyone equal chance. The talent foreign studnts need time to practice their skill after graduation. If the the right of more prepare time were deprived, it could be a kind of discrimination.
