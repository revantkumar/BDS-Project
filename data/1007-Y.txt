I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:

1. Students received education in US should also contribute their effort and energy back to US society, if they just brought what they learnt back to their own country, we might lose some important human sources.

2. US is a country of diversity, we should not give people from other countries an impression of discrinminating, it's really mean and terrible!!

3. personally speaking, students from other countries such as some asian countries, they give me an impression of diligence and hardworking, I do not want to work without them!
