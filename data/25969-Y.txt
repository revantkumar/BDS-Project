I strongly support this OPT proposed rule for F1 students in STEM program. International students on OPT are contributing to the US economy. Their hard work and dedication to the STEM field is essential to the growth of US economy. This proposed rule will benefit everyone in the U.S. It will not take jobs away from American workers, rather, international workers bring their talent and diversity in the US companies and communities. This proposed rules will make America stronger and better!
