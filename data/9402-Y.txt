I really have no idea why there are so many people against the OPT extension. I know some citizens may worry that a lot of job opportunities in the United States might be taken by international students, but it is not true. The truth is the native still have way more chances to have a job than international students do. It is ironic that China, which the government always considers as the most competitor, is trying to be more open to absorb more talents, while the United States is accidentally doing the opposite thing, insisting to be more closed, which is what the ancient Chinese government did hundreds of years ago. Is this what we expect? The United States is dying if the government believes so.
