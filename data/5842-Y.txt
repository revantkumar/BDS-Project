I really support OPT extension with STEM. Not only I am an F-1 Student with OPT extension but also I know lots of foreign students who work really hard to get significance positions in good companies.
I still remember when I was looking for a job after graduating. Many companies don't want foreign students because their OPT time is too short! The ones who got jobs in here because they are really outstanding and companies really need these people. 
Therefore, I really support 24 months OPT extension.
