I strongly support this extension.

Most competitive graduates would have stayed in the US. for at least 5 years prior to OPT STEM (4+ years of education for Bachelor or PhD and 1-year of basic OPT). Hence, they would have been considered resident aliens for tax purpose by the time OPT STEM starts (by substantial presence test) and liable to the same tax as US citizens. They will not be exempted from Social Security & Medicare Taxes. 

So there will be no preference for employers to save money from hiring those foreigners due to the exemption to contribute to social security fund. Only master students (who spend less than 3 years) may have benefited a bit from this. Still, substantial presence test counts calendar years (school starts mid-year), so most master graduates will eventually be no longer exempted from SS at some point during OPT/STEM extension period.

But if the exemption to SS is really the issue, the amendment should be performed on tax policy for aliens rather than OPT policy. This OPT extension will definitely be advantageous for tech/research industry/academia, boost economy, and in the long run create more job opportunities in the US.
