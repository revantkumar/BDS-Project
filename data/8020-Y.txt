Jane Wang Young students come to the U.S. for better future life, not only for good education. If there is no hope to stay after graduate, STEM students will stop coming to the US for their graduate education, they will choose Canada or Europe, or just stay in their own country. U.S. will lose leading edge in STEM and thus other area by losing international students.

It may be true that wage of STEM people may increase because lack of competition, the minority U.S. local STEM people will benefit, high wage may attract more local students to this area. However I would expect this procedure to take several generations, the U.S. will pay too big price in a highly competitive international environment.

The U.S. has spent a lot of education and research funding on international students, it is stupid to force them to leave right after graduate without making contribution to this country.
