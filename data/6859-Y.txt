Dear Department of Homeland Security,

My name is Ao, I'm a newly graduated Physics Ph.D. I obtained my degree in April and started working in a government research laboratory. 

I strongly support expanding the training opportunities for F-1 students. I am currently on OPT myself. The training I've got at the lab is very beneficial to the lab and myself. After I graduated, I've contributed a lot to the lab, and my enthusiasm about applying my knowledge to projects have inspired colleagues around me. My satisfactory work is recognized by my supervisor and the project leader. 

There are a lot of Ph.D. like me. We want to contribute to the country by using what we have learned from the Ph.D. student period on real projects that will help the country grow in its technology, science and economy.

It is not hard to find examples around you. Please continue providing such a good diversified, nationality-friendly environment for us. Thanks!

Best regards,
Ao
