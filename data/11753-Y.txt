I strongly support this proposed rule. Reasons are stated as followed:

1. Having talented foreign people to work in the US can make contribution to American's economy. Nowadays there are lots of foreign people working at different position and are dedicated to their job.

2. It is a good way to make the American people study hard and work hard as there's competitive effect if talented foreign people are working in the US. This can make the whole society and economy better.

3. If foreign people are not allowed to work in the US, there will be much less students coming to study in US, which could lead a large decrease in the income for the education institutes.
