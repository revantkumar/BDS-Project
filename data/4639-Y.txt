I totally support the OPT program for international students who pursue their degrees in US, and followings are my reasons:

1. United States is a country open for immigration and providing equal opportunities for education, life and work to people coming from every part of the world. And this is one of the most attractive points for people who would like to come here.
2. To achieve a degree for international students who are not using English as their mother language is really a challenge, and those who succeed to graduate must have the abilities to make contribution to the US economy with what they have learnt from the college. But to achieve these contribution, they deserve an opportunity for a job in US, otherwise the country is just wasting the resources of talented people and education.
3. A longer OPT program will attract more and more talented students to come to US which will definitely bring the benefit to US education.
