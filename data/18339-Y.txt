I do agree and support this proposal. Several reasons are listed to explain my standpoint.

To begin with, for F-1 students, it's fundamental to get an opportunity to work in the US, since the working environment can help them implement what they've learned during Master's degree effectively.

Meanwhile, the students will be more competitive after getting the chance to work in different companies, which will contribute to their future career not only in America, but also around the world.

Last, with the rapid development of US IT companies, their growing requirement of fresh and skillful employees makes it more urgent that F-1 student should get more time to work in the US after graduation.
