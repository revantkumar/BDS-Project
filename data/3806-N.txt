This is utter nonsense! We have unemployed American citizens who have paid taxes to support our government and you are caving in to special interests who use unneeded foreign workers while they lay off Americans who can do the jobs they say they need workers for. This undermines American workers and pay scales and is poor policy that should be ended.
