I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

China used to be one of the most advanced countries in the world hundreds of years ago. I think one of the reasones China were left behind in technology development in 19th and 20th century is China closed the entry for incoming knowledge. I believe only if a country is open for and welcoming talented people to contribute to it, the country will keep developing and improving. And the people living in the country will eventually benifit from a better country.

Instead of saying the income student are taking the job away from American, I would say they are making American a better place and creating even more working oppurtunities for other people in the mean time.
