I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. STEM extension is a chance for talents from all over the world to contribute themselves in USA for the entire humanity. I believe the reason why USA can keep its powerfulness is that it keeps attracting new talents and give them opportunities to show off. One year is short but plus a 1-2 years' extension is a reasonable length for those stem students to make real contributions. If stem extension is cancelled It's unfair to international students. Chanllenges exist everywhere and who deserve the jobs will finally get it. International students are not robberies or thieves stealing jobs here. They are contributors and possibilities for the country.
