Of course I support this proposal. America is no longer America if there is no equal opportunity for every person with ambition and enough ability. Especially in the field of STEM, we have advanced technology and the most talented people in the US. We have no reason to stop other talented people coming to join us just because they are not American. These people working together will not only helps themselves but also helps our society get better and makes our country the best in the field of STEM.
