Dear President,

OPT program for F1 Foreign students is hurting our American students because more and more companies prefer to hire OPT F1 students as the companies save on taxes.... Also, as there is not limit on F1 student visas, there is no way to manage the growing number of foreign students and there is increase in the crime and fraud by the foreign students...For example: F1 students show fake experience(as there is no way to really validate) and get the jobs by fraud. Consulting companies target F1/OPT students and abuse them by not paying them for their service. Also they provide fake resume to the clients and another resume for the H1 sponsorship...On the other hand American students who graduate are not able to get the decent jobs as they cannot show fake experience(it is easy to validate the resume when they have done complete education in the USA)

F1 students who are bright and smart manage to get a job through campus selection and do not need to be on OPT. OPT program extension will replace the experienced workers for good...
