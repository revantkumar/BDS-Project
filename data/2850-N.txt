The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it
We fail to see why our tax dollars should pay for foreigners to come to this country, get an education, and take jobs from citizens. American citizens come first. We are being gouged by the government on student loans, college is becoming unaffordable for our young people, and few of them can get positions if they mange to graduate. We are tired of corporations benefitting from our hard work and tired of paying the salaries of politicians who betray us and take money from those corporations so that they can have cheap labor at our expense. Tech workers have seen their salaries decline with increases in foreign workers, and need a strong national union to protect their interests!
