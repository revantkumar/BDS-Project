Mishiko Koyama I strongly SUPPORT the new OPT extension proposal.
I spend some time today to review negative comments about this. I must say it is very shortsighted for the thoughts that citizen will get job easily and get higher wages by depriving the foreign studentss legal right to work in the US. Through all these years there is only the fact that international employees are equally paid compared to the citizens. And we all know that more jobs will be created for citizens or even citizens only by allowing more international students to study and work in the US
