I strong support this rule.
A lot of people says that extent OPT will allow international students compete with American people for limited job and employer prefer to hire these international students because they are cheaper. This is actually wrong! From the perspective of international, OPT or OPT extension are just temporary stage, most of them will be transferred to H1B visa finally, so international students will choose the employer who will sponsor them for H1B Visa or Green Card. Employer will need to pay a large amount of money to sponsor their international employees for H1B Visa or Green Card, so if employer wants to save money, why they are willing to pay these money? I think the reason is that the US still needs more engineers and international engineer are very skilled. When these international students in H1B stage, they will pay the same tax rate as US citizen! IRS will never lost money. Many people only see international students pay less tax, but they never see how much money they make for their company and the United States!. From 1point 3acres bbs
So in conclusion, we are not seeking for the job positions which most Americans are seeking for, we are seeking for those positions which still need a lot of international students!
