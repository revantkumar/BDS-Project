I strongly support this rule with the following reasons:
1. DHS is taking this action to include a STEM OPT extension as part of the OPT program under the F-1 nonimmigrant classification in order to better ensure, among other important national interests, that the U.S. academic sector can remain competitive globally. As a international student, when I decided to choosing which country I would pursuing my master degree, compared with Germany, Japan and some other countries, United States was my best choose since there is OPT program that provides me enough time to get more experience in my field .

2. The duration of an extension would be set at 24 months, rather than limited to a shorter period, due to the complexity and typical durations of research, development, testing, and other projects commonly undertaken in STEM fields. Just like me, I am developing a new database for my current company, it's a large project and will definitely improve the system performance and efficiency of the whole process of our department. However, this project will last for about 2 years. If there is only one year for OPT program, then I cannot finish this project. It will be loss of company and myself.

3. Diversity is a significant character of United States. OPT program ensure that students from all over the world could have equal chance to get experience in their field. Otherwise, DHS continues to believe that the E-Verify program is an important measure to ensure the integrity of the STEM OPT extension.
