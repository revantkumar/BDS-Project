Expansion of the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program is rather short-sighted in that the American employers and foreign workers are exempt from payroll taxes. This cost the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds $4 billion between 2009 and 2015. During that same time period almost 500,000 work authorizations were approved; that translates into almost a half-million Americans who were "aced" out of tech and STEM field jobs. The extension would lead to H-1B worker visas and eventually to employment-based green cards. The OPT program has never been authorized by Congress.

Please suspend this OPT program for several years, and you will see a greater benefit to American citizens, the economy, and the solvency of Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds. At the very least, please do not expand the OPT program. Thank you.
