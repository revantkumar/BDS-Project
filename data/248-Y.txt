Just as every Americans know, Asia especially China and India are getting up. The principals behind raising countries are its populations and technologies. Those Chinese and India students learned advanced technologies from us and went back to service their own countries. Do you feel it is a waste of resources? They can service us actually if they have the right to work here. Also this will increase our populations. To complete with China is not a wise choice. See, currently China's Xi is making friends around the world. Our US is pretty much taking wars over many countries. To complete with China will only have bad effects. We can collaborate with them and achieve a win-win. With large amount of international students, the trading and communications will become much more easily and frequently. This is great! We can not be ignorant any more. We need to learn from good sides from other countries. Make this country great again!
