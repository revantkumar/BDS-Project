It is unfair and unreasonable to stop expanding the opportunities for F1 students! 
Today globalization is an unstoppable trend and many companies, especially ones in America, will not make any progress or make any benefits without those international students with STEM, like google, uber or Facebook. 

Besides, many projects from big companies or US government last more than 1 years, for instance, NSF funded projects or ones funded by local government in each state. Canceling the OPT would seriously harm and impede the the progress of the companies and governments, thus having a negative impact on Americans.
