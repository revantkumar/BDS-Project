The new rule is very important not only for international students but also for US companies and US economics. There are so many large companies in US which have international offices. I am working in one of those large companies. Our company has offices in UK, Japan, China, India and other countries. Some of my colleagues didn't get H1B visa lottery within OPT period. Instead of firing them, our company sent them to London office, Shanghai office, etc, without hiring new people in US. That means the job positions are transferred from US to other countries. With the new rule, it is easier to keep those positions in US. More positions maintained in US obviously will obviously promote US economics.
