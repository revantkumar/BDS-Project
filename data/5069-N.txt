Top Whom It May Concern:

Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students is beyond 
reprehensible. DHS has already put their hands in MY TILL by taking over $4 Billion of Social Security and Medicare trust funds. In other words they have STOLEN MY BENEFITS to give to people who are NOT DESERVING. It is no wonder there will be no COLA again in 2016. Our COLA is going to corporate welfare as the employers don't pay FICA nor Medicare taxes because these "students" don't have to pay payroll taxes. How absurd is that! And 
DHS has denied over 430,000 Americans employment between 2009-2013 so that these so called "students" can have jobs. That is being really loyal to your American citizen neighbors; friends and family. How many of them could use $60,000-90,000 tax free money to support their families? Oh, I forgot, they would have to pay all taxes so you can keep your tax funded job. 

To even consider expanding this program is outrageous. How do you sleep at night? What is the legacy you are leaving your family members let alone your fellow American citizens? SHAME ON YOU.
