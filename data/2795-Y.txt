James Higgins I am absolutely opposed to DHS's proposed expansion of the OPT program. It is an insult to OUR technical graduates and a detriment to our wage structure, tax structure, and specifically our Social Security program. 

It incentivizes US business to hire foreign workers by allowing employers to NOT pay the employer portion of payroll taxes for 3 years! Workers who benefit by working in the US MUST pay the same tax as US citizens... they're using our infrastructure, technical developments and resources to make a living here in the US. The proposed extension from 1 year to 3 years is great for business and foreigners but bad for everyone else in America. 

This proposal suffers the same ailment as most of what comes out of Washington, PRIVATIZE THE GAINS (big business), SOCIALIZE THE LOSSES (taxpayers, US students, and US workers).

I say no way.
