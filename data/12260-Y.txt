The sustainable development and upkeeping of leading position of the American technology and other industries need a lot more STEM students. The enrollment of the American citizens in STEM studies is not sufficient to supply the need of the industries. This must be supplemented by the recruitment of the international students. Extending the OPT is a simple and quick way to meet the industrial demand of the STEM graduates. It is a short term solution. In the longer term, these graduates should be given a permanent residence to serve the industry and national interests of America.
