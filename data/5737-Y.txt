I think the extension of OPT is beneficial for both american people and international students, and I strongly support this ruling. It makes me sad to see so many people against this proposed ruling. Contrary to what some may believe, the fact that foreign graduate students try to take highly skilled jobs to work in this country makes it increasingly competitive. The work they have done in places like silicon valley has benefited this country as a whole as well as its people. 

Nevertheless, it's been significantly more difficult for foreign STEM students to stay and work here now compared to 5 or 10 years ago because of the obsolete immigration regulations. The chance of scoring a H1B visa has reached the lowest in the history which drives foreign students out of the country. It just makes no sense for the US to educate students with its best colleges for other countries and then force them to go home, especially when many of them receive scholarships and free tuition for their graduate level studies. 

STEM students take jobs that require special training and skills in science and technology. In fact, when both foreign and american STEM students with similar background aim for the same job, companies rarely pick foreign students and everyone knows recruiting them and going through the process for their visas is a pain.

Extending and improving the OPT program can potentially give more foreign students more opportunities to work here and stop the immigrant exodus.
