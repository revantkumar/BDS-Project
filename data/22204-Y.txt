OPT Stem should exist for the following reasons:
Its completely understandable that the local residence should protect their rights and home in states. The truth is that the threat target isnt the group of international students. Each year, large amounts of illegal immigrants flow into states and they are the threat for the safety and resource in states. They are using natural and human resources but due to their education limit, they can not provide much high technical work which is in high demand in the fast growing world. Besides that part, still large percent of non technic immigrants flow into America each year. They are the main threat to the local residence. We always want immigrants who can help protect our home and make contributions to developing our home. So take a look at the statistics of past 20 years immigrants. How much percentage is those F1 holders gain residence after they graduation in states. Compared to other immigrants, the amount of them is too tiny to be mentioned. As a result, how can they be the target that threaten the local residence.
Most of the international students they have higher education and better technical skills. They make high contributions to the IT area, medical researches, financial investment study.
Again, Stem doesnt make a threat to the local residences living or career. People who hold F1 visa face more challenges to get a job because of their temporary status. And the job should strictly be within their study area.
