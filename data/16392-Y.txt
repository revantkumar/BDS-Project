I strongly support this new rule. I work in Silicon Valley. Despite a large portion of domestic workers, each department has foreign STEM students as well, taking responsibility in core projects for a certain time now. If this new rule does not pass, I can be certain that tech companies will be in panic, millions will be lost because of a messy roadmap, halted workflow and no right men in charge for. The worst case would be this will catalyze IT bubbles, and no men, not foreigners or U.S. workers, will get a job whatever!
