I strongly support this policy for following reasons.
First,everyone deserve to have equal chances,we international students have studied in America and we do deserve to have chance to practice what we have learnt.
Also, US universities can attractive more international students by that.
Last, the exist of international students can improve US economics in a considerable degree.
