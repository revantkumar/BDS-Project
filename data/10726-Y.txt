Mi Zhou Extending opt means a lot to me:
I'm a Computer Science master candidate from China. I applied to study in US because the experience in silicon valley is very valuable when I get back to China. However, fresh graduate or 1-year experience is not enough. If I'm a 3-year experienced software engineer, internet companies in China would like to hire me with salary that is 5 times of that of a fresh or 1-year experienced person.

Extending to 24 months would guarantee that I can gain at least 3-year experience in Silicon Valley, which I appreciate a lot.
