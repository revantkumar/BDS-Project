I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1.It is excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months. This brings the total duration of OPT for STEM majors to 3 years, which is sufficient for F-1 students to secure a great deal of very valuable experience and practical training and make very meaningful contributions to US research, technology development, and product development before returning to their home countries.

2.Diversity is very important for the U.S.

3.Competition is everywhere, without it maybe is bad thing happened.

Please get this proposal passed!
