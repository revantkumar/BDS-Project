Cutting the OPT extension is not a smart move for the U.S. due to the following reasons:
First, the amount of international students in U.S. will go down because a lot of them come here not only for a study but for a future career in society. Once the OPT extension is cut, then they will choose other countries for further study. And also, US universities currently have a lot of international students and universities need them for financial reasons. Once these students leave, the tuition and fee for domestic students will go up and may cause less education in next generation and damage U.S economy in the long term.
Second, the OPT provides students with an opportunity to work in the U.S. They are not hurting the U.S. economy, to the contrary, they are helping the U.S. economy. Cutting the OPT extension will hurt U.S. economy because a lot of new grads will be forced to get laid off and go back to their national origin. And they also leave with newest technology in their mind. Technologies in different areas will be taken away, such as IT, civil engineering, physics, chemics.
Third, the U.S is an immigrant country. And to be a student then a worker is always like the first step to become an U.S citizen. Cutting the OPT extension may cause U.S a lot of talented students and workers, such the foundation of this great country may be lost.
These are my opinions. I do not think cutting OPT is a good move. And the appropriate time period for OPT should be around 18 months to 24 months. Thus, students that are able and willing to stay in America can get enough(2 times) chances to stay in this country.
