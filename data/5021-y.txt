Lichen Weng OPT and extension for STEM majors are critical to US education, vast US employers, and eventually US economy. 
Education in US is not a small part of economy and OPTs are important to provide necessary training opportunities to maintain the quality and reputation of US education. Such reputation helps attract 27 billion dollars from foreign students in 2013/2014 according to IEE.org and that's even growing. Shrinking OPTs may lower US education quality and thus make it less attractive to foreign students. 
Those foreign students also help spread US values throughout the world. They are trained hard in US, contributing to their employers, and are engaged in culture and knowledge exchanges actively. They will take their learning, not only knowledge but also US values, with them and influence more sections in the world. 
The bottom line is there is a need and someone can prove his/her value, their stay is a working visa discussion, instead of optional practical training. 
Taking OPT or its extension out of US education curriculum is definitely bad news for US education, a big revenue industry, and for US economy. It does not eliminate needs for excellent workers from US employers, but rather pushing talents to countries that compete with US and have been vying for more talents since long ago.
