I totally support this proposal. Im really surprised to see so many comments against it. Many people are worried that foreign STEM workers would take jobs away from US citizens. Well, first of all, these jobs arent supposed to be US citizen only -- unless these companies or employers give up being the top players in their games. For my own experience, there is just no way to hire an all-American work force at my currently company due to the extremely high hiring bar. Same for the company I worked before. Sure they can lower the bar, but the consequence would be disastrous -- next thing people discuss would be whether to prohibit foreign companies in the US market, because they can build so much better products with the top talents they have who would otherwise be hired by the US companies. And its also ignorant of people to think foreign STEM workers as cheap. Companies pay top dollars for good foreign STEM worker, and thats only because they really really need them. 

I think the United States is still the best country in the world. And that's because she still attracts and keeps top talents from all around the world. Handicap the OPT program? Sure in the short team US citizens might get more jobs. But I think people are missing the big picture here. Without a global talents pool, companies wont have a work force to be able to win in a global market. So in the long run, companies will struggle in the global competition, and if they fail, their US workers will also suffer. In conclusion, I think its shortsighted if we dont let this proposal pass.
