I will write my U.S. Senators and Representative to oppose the latest extension proposals on OPT and STEM. 
Please do not allow this to be passed by Executive Order. Congress should oversee any and all extensions for student 
and other visa's. Americans should be filling these positions paying taxes instead of allowing foreign students to learn and 
work at the American taxpayer's expense.
