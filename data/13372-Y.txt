Obviously, canceling OPT extension will lead to a big economy loss for United States in the next few years. For IT Industry, a great number of engineers come from those F1 students who aren't native Americans or green card owners, without legal OPT extension authorization for those work here in U.S. , they have no choice but to go back to their home countries after graduation or first OPT ending, which will lead to the result of being lack of fresh labor power and innovation power of U.S IT industry. Under this case, ensuring and expanding OPT for F-1 nonimmigrant students with stem degrees and cap-gap relief for all eligible F-1 students is by all means a smart idea and the best solution, it should and has to be PASSED.
