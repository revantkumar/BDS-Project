I strongly support this act. The US society itself is a immigration society, and the core spirit of American dream is that everyone can have an equal opportunity for success. The US is the most powerful country in the world mainly due to that it can attract the most talented people all around the world to come and serve for it. By expanding the OPT, certainly it will help to attract more talented people to come and keep US's superiority.
