As a international graduate student I am really counting on OPT and its extension. I love USA and I'd live to work and live here for the rest of my life. But it is becoming harder and harder to get a H1B working VISA before your opt expries simply because the number of H1B is limited every year and we have to roll a dice to choose we can get a H1B. The extenion of OPT will really give me hope that it is still possible to acomplish the American Dream here.
