I think that this new rule will definitely benefit the country from long run. Those comments which claimed that this would harm domestic workers are making no sense at all. No companies would tend to hire foreign employees over domestic ones since foreign employees have a higher chance to leave and go back to their own countries any time. The only reason why the companies hire foreign workers is their special knowledge or skills which no domestic applicants can match to the same level.

It is not fair for some unemployed domestic people to blame foreign workers. After all, as the world becomes more connected, domestic protection will be reduced and everyone has to improve their skills and knowledge to stay employed.

On the contrary, foreign workers may serve as a incentive to boost the overall level of all employees across the country.

In summary, this new rule is more than necessary for the better future of the country.
