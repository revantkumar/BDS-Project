Dear Home Land Security Department:

As US Based technology companies are desperately competing for talent, please be mindful of adding additional burden to the already heavily burdened employers while hiring OPT workers. Especially in STEM fields, OPT is a great way to seek talent, see if it will lead to a sponsorship for H1B and a valuable addition to our company. By making the STEM OPT extension almost like an H1B-light, it is adding unnecessary burden and expense.

We understand there is political pressure and nativistic tendencies that may make the government take steps in further restricting access to highly skilled workers but in reality what ends up happening is larger companies with deeper pockets being more compliant and smaller companies being shut out of the foreign high skilled talent.

This is a net loss for the US economy as these these highly sought after foreign nationals fuel the amazing innovation engine we have created and it is mind boggling why we should shoot ourselves in the foot. Let's make it as easy as possible to hire foreign workers with STEM degrees without making them wait up to a decade for a green card, so when Australia, Canada, even Germany pitches the same talent, we don't loose out!

Sincerely yours,
