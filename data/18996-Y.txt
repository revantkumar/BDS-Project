It is great that there is a new regulation for OPT STEM. I can comment on great impact of this from my side. I am currently a postdoc in biochemistry at Yale. I am really sure that I am not "stealing" this job from any American with equivalent (or even a little bit lower qualifications) because none of the Americans that have experience and knowledge comparable to mine would agree to work for this salary after spending 6 years doing PhD. And somebody has to do this job, it is about discovering new medicines and treating life threatening diseases! Doesn't US want to be the leading country that develops some medicine that cures cancer better than any other known drug? With all of that I am paying 1/4 of my salary in taxes, do donations to non-profit organizations that support those in need, live, eat and use other services spending most of my salary here, in the US. So, money that are payed to me for my job are staying here, in the country and provide something for US citizens. It is something that I doubt many Americans with my income at my age can afford to do. I don't know what is the situation in other STEM sectors but speaking for biochemistry that is done in universities, US needs foreign workers.
