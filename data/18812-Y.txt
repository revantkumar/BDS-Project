I am a software development manager at a small company and I strongly support the OPT extension. Because most of international junior and senior developers in our team do very well in their job. A lot of them are in OPT status, if the extension is over, I will have to find more folks to fill in the slots, but thats not gonna be an easy task to do in any way. I believe currently there still are a huge need for international STEP employees in the States.
