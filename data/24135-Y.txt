Oppurtunities should be available to anyone who are actually capable of seizing them, no matter where the people is born or coming from. It is hardworking people who contribute to our society, to our world. Students coming to this country spend time and effort to make it a better place. They shared their intelligence and good personalities with everyone else, made contribution to both academia and industry, and as a fact paid the tax as a common US citizen. So every student deserve equal opportunities, it is not about nationality as it is not about gender. It is natural and rational for the government to support STEM programme. Everyone is just trying to contribute to the whole society by taking full advantages of her own abilities, not stealing anything from the others.
