I'm writing to support STEM extension because it serves our tech industry. People need to know that the people who are unemployed are not the same type of people as these STEM students- they simply have different set of skills! Stopping STEM extension doesn't solve unemployment. In fact, it will increase unemployment cuz the lack of tech workers would force big tech companies to move to other countries, or simply die!
