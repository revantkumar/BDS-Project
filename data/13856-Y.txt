It seems very weird that US forbids (or at least strongly limits) the possibility for people all over the world to serve herself. One reason for US to prosper is that she has provided first-class education to international students, and then attracted the best among them to stay and contribute to this beloved country. But now the States are effectively forcing them to leave US and work for their motherlands. This is such a strange way of showing altruism.
