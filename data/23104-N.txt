I strongly oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. Many recent college graduates in the USA are already struggling to find jobs and this action would be the equivalent of a kick in the teeth for them. What employer would not prefer to hire a foreign worker over an American worker if they do not have to pay their fair share of the employer portion of payroll taxes and additionally can offer lower wages to the foreign workers? The American worker doesn't stand a chance! It's a lose-lose situation not only for American workers, but for citizens who receive services provided by taxpayers, since companies will be paying less taxes. With more people out of work, unable to attain jobs acquired by foreign workers (hence, in need of unemployment income) *and* less tax revenues from companies, you do not need to do the math to know that this is a dangerous and preposterous proposal. Why are we training foreign workers anyway with the expectation that they will return to their countries and utilize their new skills (which also may not be the case since this program would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card)? Is it to make other countries more competitive with ours and ship even more USA jobs overseas? It makes very little sense. Please, I implore you to use a modicum of common sense and reject this hurtful proposal. The long term effects if this expanded program passes will be felt acutely by all Americans. Thank you.
