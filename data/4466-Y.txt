Foreign STEM graduates are well educated in the United States and will make huge contributions to the US economic development. It is a wise decision to extend STEM opt times so that the US will still be the leaders of the world without sending them back to their home countries. It is ridiculous to believe that foreign graduates will take Americans' jobs because there are not enough qualified American candidates for those positions in many high-tech companies.
