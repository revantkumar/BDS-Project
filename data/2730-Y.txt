I am a student at UW-Madison doing my Masters in Engineering.I truly believe that extending the OPT period will vastly improve the already well structured engineering program in the United states.

I am currently doing my internship in a very popular company in Milwaukee and I am learning a lot of new ideas and methodologies which aids my education and also helps in the growth of the company.I believe that this will best suit all the students who would like to go back to their mother nations with a good 3 years of experience. This is a win win for both the USA and for aspiring MS graduates like us.

Kindly consider this petition.

Thank you
