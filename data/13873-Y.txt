As a Chinese student who are going to study Pharmacology in U.S next year, and I hope to get Ph.D in my dream school just like millions of young people, who born and grown in America. I deem that the performance of this rule would benefit Americans as well as international students. So I support this proposal for these reasons:

Most students admitted to get further education in U.S are excellent in their field. To acquire this chance we have studied assiduously for years to meet the rigorous requirements. Evidences have proved that international students possess the capacity to enhance the development in various aspects of U.S. As same as the prospect of native people, we all hope to create better life on this land.

Competition is the source of improvement. By competing with foreign students, native students would make greater contributions. Notwithstanding in most cases competition is combined with cooperation. The combination would induce both kinds of students to earn visible benefits.

Moreover, there is no essential difference between these two types of students, because of our desires to acquire knowledge, explore our areas and build this nation. Compared with the founders of USA, we are doing the same thing.
