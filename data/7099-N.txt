I strongly oppose allowing foreign students to stay longer in this country so that cheap, corrupt corporations can hire them instead of American graduates with similar training. I strongly oppose a rule that would allow companies to pay lower wages and no social security taxes if they hire foreign students over American students. My son is graduating this May with a STEM degree. How can he compete for a decent job if companies can get cheap, foreign labor? How will Social Security stay solvent if foreigners are allowed to work here without paying Social Security taxes? I urge you to do all in your power to stop this reprehensible rule from being enacted!!
