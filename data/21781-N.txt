This won"t take long...
As I see it, the Optional Practical Training Program (OPT) is nothing more than a concerted effort to replace American workers, primarily white and black, with foreign nationals, mostly, from Asian countries. This anti-American ruse, perpetrated by the Obama administration, is steeped in racialist assumptions that foreign workers are vastly superior to American-born workers. Those of us who live in the real world know that these infuriating conjectures are false and, primarily, designed to replace the high-tech workforce with people who will work for a few dollars less. 
For brevity's sake, I defer to my fellow Americans to bolster my argument with statistical details and such. I would cherish the luxury of doing so myself, but I simply don't have the time to spare. 
For the record, I am a 59-year-old, underemployed, white male with a Master's degree in Mass Communications Studies. I have had a few decent jobs in my life; however, for the past three years, I have been working one, and sometimes two, part-time jobs. My combined salary, for all three years, barely took me over the ONE-YEAR federal poverty line. I have been supplementing my income by "borrowing" money from elderly parents. I could continue with this woeful tale, but self-pity tends to turn my stomach. 
For God's sake, and for the sake of this country, stop messing with the American worker. There are millions of people out there like me----and we are fighting mad!
