I SUPPORT this regulation for expanding OPT for F-1 with STEM degrees.
If US could not keep these international students with STEM degrees working for our own industrial in the field of science and technology, these students will go back to their own countries and work for our competitors. It will be huge impact for our own industries. Economy will be shocked and jobs in the US will decrease. We should not transport our knowledge, talented engineers to our competitors.
