I strongly support this rule.
There are several reasons:
1. These foreign graduate students, especially PhD students occupy a more than 60% percent in American research institutes. The development of future technique is mainly relied on their knowledge and hard working. If they left the US for this reason, it would be a great loss to the future of the US.

2. They paid lots of tax to the whole country. 

3. One of the most important reason why US leads the development of the high technology is because of its good attractiveness to these high-educated foreigner scientists and well trained engineers. Such as after world war II, most of the advanced technology is leaded by these excellent scientists who came from other countries.

4. These high-educated people have very good training in the US. This means this country has spent lots of time in training them and teaching them knowledge. All of this should be in preparation for the development of the US instead of let them contribute to other countries. Some of these countries may be the direct competitor of the US. 

5. It's American spirit to give everyone equal chance.
