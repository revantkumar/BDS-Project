I strongly support this proposal. I think it is beneficial for both us citizens and international students.
Firstly, based on the US history, we can see that the more diverse the nation is, the more stronger it is. Many talented scientists were OPTer before. They made great contributions to US. 
Secondly, competition is not a bad thing. It helps Citizens as well. 
Also, international students helps a lot in information technology industry, which makes the United States a better country.
Please SUPPORT! Thank you.
