It is important for students who spend their parent's hard earned money to repay them. We should have the opportunity to work and reside here in USA. Please ease the immigration process of OPT, H1B and green cards. This would encourage more people to have a fruitful, memorable experience in the country. I strongly vote up for the OPT STEM extension to anything > 24 months.
