Yichu Li I'm a supporter of this rule. 
For yeas America has leaded the world as one of the most innovative countries in the world. America needs to keep its leading position in STEM areas by attracting the most intelligent people from all over the world working for her.
Those students who graduate from American universities are eager to implement what they've learned from school and make a real impact on the economy. They are not stealing jobs. They are making their own contributions to this country and creating more jobs by innovation.
It would be more than stupid kicking these people away back to their home countries right after their graduation. This is in fact, against the very spirit of what makes this country a great one.
