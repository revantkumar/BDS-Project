I'm totally support this regulation for these three unbeatable reasons:
1. It's obviously the IT driven and data driven century and these four majors have a really great impact and it will make united states a great country better than ever. Technology will improve the working efficiency and give people more time with family
2. Another 24 months extension gives employer more time and patient to evaluate if this candidate will make a contribution to the company and make sure everyone being selected is valuable. At the same time, employer will consider more native workforce and enhance the competitive of Americans
3. An attraction for international students, more tuition and fees income.
