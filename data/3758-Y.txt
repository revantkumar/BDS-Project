I support the OPT extension for 24 months. 

I have completed PhD in Civil Engineering from one of the top 10 universities in United States (Carnegie Mellon). After PhD, it is extremely important for students like me to gain industrial/professional experience for understanding the application of research done at the University. Not only for me, but also for the employers in United States, this extension is extremely important. The employers and organizations (such as: NSF, National Labs) in US fund PhD research in Universities and train PhD students. These highly trained PhD students are then needed in these organizations/industries to carry forward the research done at the universities and implement it industrially. 

Moreover, the slots for H1 are very limited. OPT gives students more chances to apply for H1. Currently OPT extension period is 17 months, which is unfair, because some students get two chance to apply for H1 where as some others get three chances based on when the OPT is started. The 24 month extension would make it fair and equal for everyone.
