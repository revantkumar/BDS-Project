I oppose how far America has gone in globalizing in that the wealthy powers-that-be have outsourced our jobs to foreign countries and give what is left in employment to immigrants. Hence, there are multi-millions of Americans out of work and struggling to hold on while many other millions of Americans are homeless to semi-homeless and essentially dying on the streets.

Based on Genesis 11: The destruction of the Tower of Babel when God spread humanity around the world as different races speaking different languages. God will destroy the one-world economy effort also and send people back to the countries HE put them in in the Old Testament.

I hear a rumor and don't know if it is true or not, but there are groups of unemployed and homeless planning a violent revolution in America just like the French REvolution in terms of secrecy and shock to the powerful that such a thing could happen
