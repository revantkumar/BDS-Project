I strongly agree with as what DHS has pointed out. The opportunity for job training is a very useful part in American college training. International students have made great contribution to America economy and development of technology considering the tuition and living expense. Also, more international students mean great increase of fusion of America society. America as a great and developed country aims to attract more superior international students to be here for studying and living.

I notices there's one comment saying" safeguard for US workers in related field", which protects the locals' rights. Also, as mentoring and training plans proposed that " formal mentoring and training programs to augment students' academic learning through practical experience", which is also very useful to protect US local workers' rights. I believe that this shouldn't be a barrier to local US workers. On the other hand, international students' rights should not be sacrificed because of small amount of lazy people. This should be a motivation for all people in America to contribute more to social development.
