As an international student in U.S. I strongly support the proposal. 

First, I think let international student work in the U.S is a way to show the diversity of U.S. We also pay taxes to U.S government and make contributions to the U.S. 

Second, the competitions between international students and U.S citizens do exist. But most company like to consider citizen instead of international students as their first choice. Also, competition is not a bad thing. 

Finally, the reason STEM students can find a job in the U.S lies in the truth that American do lack of students in STEM field.
