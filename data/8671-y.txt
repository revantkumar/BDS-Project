Terry Stephan I oppose DHS's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. Right now, it's difficult for US Citizens to get jobs in tech, and when they do, the entry-level salary does not compare to the costs of schooling it took to get the job. Having to compete with foreign workers would make it that much more difficult for American Citizens!
