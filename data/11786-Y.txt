I don't know why there are many of negative voices. 
Expanding is not harmful to our country. Most STEM foreigner students are talented and more willing to contribute themselves in a company. Having them stay can potentially speed up growth of an organization even for the whole society. Kicking them out will lead to outflow of talent to the whole tech field. Loss is UNPREDICTABLE!!!!! If there is no expanding, no company will spend time and money to train a "swing" person. Please think the situation before making any decision!
