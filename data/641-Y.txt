I support that OPT for F-1 students should be extended to 24 months. We need more time to get ourselves more prepared for working, and to get better job opportunities. We want to transform our knowledge from classes into really working abilities. We pay for the taxes, make contributions to the United States, please give us more time to make a better future for ourselves and for Uncle Sam.
