Fully support on extension of OPT time for F-1 students.

For such a great country that is well-known for its freedom and equality, equal job opportunity for F-1 students should be the next thing this country could do. 

If we look back at the modern history a little bit, highly educated foreign intelligence played an important role in boosting science and economy in US and will continue to be a great contribution in these fields. Offering F-1 students better training opportunities will benefit not only the individuals but also the country in terms of continuously attracting global intelligence and keeping this country the leading position in science and all other endeavors.

Earning the job by capacity instead of by nationality is equality. This will only make this country stronger.
