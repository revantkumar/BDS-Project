I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule expanding the Optional Practical Training program to allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, it also allows them to avoid paying their share of payroll taxes. With so many Americans struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens. This rule is particularly egregious given the heavy debt burden of American STEM graduates who need good quality jobs to help them pay off their loans.
