I would definitely vouch for expanding training opportunities for F-1 international students. It is a win-win situation both for the student and also to the US with respect to the economy.

For the international student, it gives him/her more time for practical training on the area of his study in terms of exposure to industry. It also gives him a chance to exercise his/her skillset in an industry environment.

For the US, the contribution to the US economy is immense by a foreign student in terms of generating revenue, generating Intellectual Property which can then be used for commercialization, etc.
