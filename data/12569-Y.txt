For all people who object to the plan, please see this story.
I am working under OPT STEM extension now. In 2013, I came to the US to pursue Masters degree on computer science area. Two years later, I graduated with high GPA and high quality thesis. During those two years, I hold a graduate assistance position, which waived all my tuition (totally around 45k dollars). I never paid tax to this country before I came here. I enjoyed all free public facility, including free advanced education here for two years. Dont you think I own this country? Now I have a job, and this job is not only for making money for my family. I am well educated, smart and young. I pay tax, and work hard to create more value for my state, for this country (I am working with a state government). If you are a tax payer, do you want me to stay here for a longer time, or to go back to my county to make contribution over there? Yes, I do want to stay in this country, because the friendly people, good environment, good education for my kids here. But my staying is also benefit to my employer and this country. I was not luck enough to get H1b visa in last visa lottery. This new OPT STEM extension policy will help me to get more chance to win the lottery. So that I can pay more tax, make more contribution. Its a win-win result, isnt it?
Now thousands of people are on the same boat with me. You have two choices:
Option number one: Young people come to this country; learn new technology and useful skills. When they are ready to work, send those tenants back. America is the most generous country; we educate people all over the world, and let them help their own country.
Option number two: Young people come to this country; learn new technology and useful skills. When they are ready to work, let them stay in the US, serve this country.
Its not about right or wrong, its about how tax payer in this country will think on this thing.
