Rahul Muthoo I support STEM OPT Extension. It is a MUST
As an International student and STEM graduate, I like to see this rule published and implemented without adversely affecting the 1000's of Highly Skilled and Highly Motivated students in F-1 status who are contributing to U.S. Innovation, scientific discovery, technology improvements and U.S. economy.
