I am very supportive to the newly proposed rule about the OPT extension. The international students who graduated from STEM majors have been making great contribution to U.S. economy, research and education. The OPT and OPT extension policy provides a good way for U.S. to retain those skillful and precious talents in US, contributing to keep U.S. competitive and powerful. In addition, for the most fields the STEM students work on, there are insufficient local talent supply from US citizens.
On the other hand, if this rule cannot be approved in time, lots of highly skillful and educated talents will be forced to leave US, which will definitely cause unacceptable loss to many high-tech companies and research organizations. By the way, these lost talents might in turn strengthen U.S.' competitor countries.
In addition, lots of the OPT holders are with master/PhD degrees, who achieved their research degrees through the sponsoring from scholarship and research/teaching assistant-ship, which source from the US tax-payers. Their leaving from US also causes a waste of tax investment.
In a word, it is imperative for the government to approve it in time, which can win support from the majority of U.S. industries, academia and common citizens.
