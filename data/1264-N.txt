I just don't understand how this administration can keep breaking the law! An internel memo reveals four options of varying expansiveness, with option 1 providing EADs to "all individuals living in the United States," including illegal aliens, visa-overstayers, and H-1B guest-workers, while option 4 provides EADs only to those on certain unexpired non-immigrant visas (Giving EADs to any of the covered individuals, however, is in direct violation of Congress's Immigration & Nationality Act and works to dramatically subvert our carefully wrought visa system.") There aren't enough jobs for U S citizens, let alone jobs for legal immigrants. Our govt. is NOT looking out for OUR best interest. Obama's agenda is to flood our country with thousands and thousands of illegal aliens and that's not even counting the Muslim refugees he plans to bring to this country by early next yr and we are talking about 75,000! His plan is to destroy this country and create new voters(illegal aliens) which will add to his Democratic /Socialist party. This dictator must be stopped. Our country is on the verge of a economic collapse. NO MORE IMMIGRANTS, NO MORE ILLEGAL ALIENS, SECURE OUR BORDER NOW.
