the new OPT extension is really encouraging for both companies and students.

The high technology companies can keep the top talents and make a lot of profit, like apple, google and facebook. Three years OPT give the international students and the companies enough time to finish a research or project. The high technology will make the whole country more competitive. 

At the same time, the opt extension is also a rewording for the foreign students. More and more foreign students coming for education, which brings the related industry development. Some big companies are increasing business outside of United States and those foreign students are the target potential employee. Because they have more than 1 year working experience in United States, which means they can serve well in those multination companies.
