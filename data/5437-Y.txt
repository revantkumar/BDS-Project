I am an international student from China. I graduated this summer and got a job tow months ago.I strongly supported the extension of OPT for the following reasons.

1.My major is environmental engineering and I am doing the right job related to my major. I get great interest in my job and want to make more contribution to the United States in the future. However due to my international identification, I have to have H1B before my OPT end. My boss will not give me the sponsorship until my training period ends which is 18 months from the day I began working. So if the OPT extension is canceled, I will not be able to work here. I will loose my favorite job and I even not be able to have a chance to become a good engineer. if the OPT extension is canceled,all I can do is wait for my OPT expires and go back to my home country. I will loose all I have had here,friends,families. I cannot even imagine what a disaster it is to my life. I may even loose my hope of life.

2.It is a pity for most of the talented international students. Most of them who can find a job in the United States are excellent and hard-working. Don't let the short OPT becomes the limitation of introducing talents. That will be a great lose of the US government. 

3.The OPT extension will definitely attract more people to study in the United States and international students can obviously develop local economy and absorbing foreign investment. For example, I study and work at Michigan State University which has lots of international students. Every year they pay for high tuition fees which is truly important to keep MSU running. In addition, many restaurants are operated by Chinese students at East Lansing. So we may conclude that international students play an important role in American society. There properties should be guaranteed.

Please take my suggestions into consideration! Thank you!
