I strongly support this ruling simply because
1) The well believed American Spirit should allow anyone with certain talent or advanced education to share his/her wisdom in the US, not hindered by any immigration blockage. 

2) These talented personal will be the national interest of United States. It has been positively impacting the American society not only academically but also economically. And I do believe United States are in need of this national interest for the year to come.

3) It will be against the Constitutional law that foreigners are US citizens are treated differently. Human being is born with equal rights. Half a century ago, MLK made his famous speech "I have a dream" to enlighten general public the danger about racism. It is today my responsibility to put down a seed that would very possible leads to equal rights in the near future.

Thank you!
