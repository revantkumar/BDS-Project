I strongly support this Rule:

1. The international students come to our country to spend money on their degree. They are customers and bring money to our market so we can have more job opportunities. This rule will attract more international students and let them stay longer in US, that is a great thing!

2. Some of the international students become faculties in our universities and make great contribution to our Science and Technology area. So many examples to name, many Nobel Prize winners were international students before.

3. Many of the international students build start-up companies. These companies bring us more job opportunities instead of taking job opportunities from us. Yahoo, Monster are all founded by international students from China.
