Yiqing Zhou As a student of STEM degrees
First of all it would give us a opportunity to work here, it's a good way for two countries communicating each other and it can also improve the relationship 

Secondly, as I know, Not a lot of American students are studying in STEM major, it would cause a huge gap if do not employ the foreigner employees.

The last but not least, there is not relationship between the American people would lose job and foreigner can have longer time to work there.

So, I'd like to say OPT extension do more advantage than disadvantage.
