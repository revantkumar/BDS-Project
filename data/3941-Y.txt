I totally agree with this proposal! Just because if there is no expanding OPT chance for international students, it will significantly decrease the economic growth of America. According to one estimate ,international students bring a lot of money into the United States, contributing roughly $22 billion to the U.S. economy in 2012. Even the Larry Summers, former secretary of the treasury and former Harvard president, lists exporting higher educationbringing more international students to American institutionsas a key part of his recommendations for economic growth.
