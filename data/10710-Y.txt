I strongly support the extension!

Why do so many people think the hired STEM students will be detriment to the social security system and complain about they are stealing your job by asking for a lower wage? Do those people have any common sense at all? 

STEM students are well-educated student and they are not easily compensated. They are not cheap labor at all! According to a statistics, the average salary of foreign H1B worker earns as much as an average American worker does! More importantly, they create more fortune than what they earn! For example, every foreign tech worker would created more than two working positions for American citizens? Why would we send those job creators back to wherever they are from with the skills and knowledge they learned here? They would only help their native country like China and Russia to backfire on us!
