I strongly support this rule because international STEM majors in school generally get MUCH higher GPA than americans. Why not hire some more academically achieved foreigners? 

America as a country started with immigration and grew to the best country in the world by attracting talented immigrants from all over the worlds. All those talented students who had a outstanding academic performance deserve a chance to stay in US and contribute to this blooming society.
