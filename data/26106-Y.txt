Simply looking back at the development of science and technology, as well as economy of the US in the past 50 years, one can easily see how international talents are making significantly contributions to this nation. The OPT STEM extension is one of the basic rule to continuously provide opportunity for these smart people to further contribute to the US. Consequently, I strongly support this new rule.
Some people consider that this new rule imposes further competition in the job market for US citizen. I would say this is completetly insane! Competition is one of the sole of the US, and such competition is the very force which makes the US the most powerful nation. Also, a individual can move to higher level to the society through his/her own effort by competing with others. This is the American dream! If one considers such competition as a negative thing, then probably he/she should try to spend more effort in improving himself/herself, rather than trying to turning down the OPT rule which is so important for long-term development for the US.
