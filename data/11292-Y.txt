This rule really saves my life! I'm currently a Harvard student and I'm employed by Google after my graduation. Without OPT, I'll be having a tremendous pressure on continuing my job as a prospective Google Engineer. 

I really like US and I wish I could have the chance to work for Google. Please make it pass.
