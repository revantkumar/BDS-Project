I think the proposed rule is beneficial for both international students and American people. 

1. Many international students got full scholarships from American universities. The U.S. educated them and supported their lives in America. When they got a Master/Doctor degree, it is time for them to make their contributions to the U.S. economy. It is reasonable to give them more opportunities to work for the U.S. 

2. Those highly educated students will make numerous innovations during their OPT and STEM extension periods. And will help develop the most cutting edge technologies which make American companies more competitive in the world. A good economy will apparently be benefit to most American people.

3. STEM majors are most engineer/science majors with specific expertise. It is hard to train a STEM student in a short time. It is important to find a way to make their knowledge serve for the U.S. I think the proposed OPT STEM extension rule is one of the solutions.
