To expand and improve training opportunities other than for US graduates, is an infringement upon our Constitution and
it places our own graduates in great disadvantage . We require our students to pay in full for their schooling , yet out of our
taxes that we the American citizens pay for, we provide those who are not our own the ability not only to provide them with
free tuition but give them an advantage after they graduate.

I propose that this program be completely canceled. It only takes funds from our country to provide, who get free tuition and other expenses paid for without any way of paying back for the free education provided. Why are these programs not provided for American students instead of foreign students, which, we do not know if they are involved in terrorist groups, we should not allow foreigners to get free education period.
Many IT companies, which are indian or foreign, are the ones pushing this program, which allows them to have a constant flow of trained workers, which they do not pay well, and do not provide jobs for American workers, because they want to be
paid in relation to their education and ongoing pay.These are workers trained by our government to provide foreign companies with unlimited amount of workers at a low pay scale.

On the other hand, this program has never been approved by Congress. Every American citizen should be indignant, with this abuse .

We want our citizens, our American fellowmen to be hired and paid what they have paid to get an education, instead of
providing education to those who are not our own. If foreign students come to study let them pay their tuition. 
Enough is enough with the abuse!!!!
