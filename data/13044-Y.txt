I strongly SUPPORT this proposal for the following reasons: 1. F-1 nonimmigrant students in STEM are making great contribution to the U.S., they are engineers who are developing and using cutting edge technologies for building great things to facilitate people's life as well as consolidating the technology foundation of the U.S., they are entrepreneurs who are promoting the economy and creating more jobs for the U.S., they are also investors who are bringing large amounts of investments to boost the development of the U.S.. 2. Diversity is very important for the U.S., diversity brings different innovative ideas, lots of professors in STEM were international students, lots of talented engineers were international students, and they are making the whole U.S. thriving. 3. F-1 nonimmigrant students bring competition that has positive effects on the U.S., international students take jobs which local students are unwilling to take such as programming intensive jobs, also international students are making local students preparing themselves better for getting competing jobs. In sum, international students in STEM are making great contribution to the U.S. as well as making the U.S. being more competitive in the world.
