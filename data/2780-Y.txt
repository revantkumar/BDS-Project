Strongly argument for Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students

1) F-1 students in STEM, are people who supporting competitively enterprise in the States, who taxes them a lot. OPT has 3 months limit if you have not found a job, which is a good way to filter some not very excellent or competitive people. Others who remains should be given longer opportunity to contribute in this country.
Applicants who are eligible for OPT, generally have been well-educated. They are the long-term competitive source of the states, please refer to the Roosevelt/Regan's reform which introduce the act/policy to build the foundation and infrastructure, that produce today's US. 
2) US should be a friendly country to immigrant through all its history. Your great president, Roosevelt, is immigrant. Please refer to the document: "His parents were sixth cousins[7] and both were from wealthy old New York families. They were of mostly English descent; Roosevelt's patrilineal great-grandfather, Jacobus Roosevelt III, was of Dutch ancestry, and his mother's maiden name, Delano, could be traced to a French Huguenot immigrant ancestor of the 17th century"
3) Worlds are more and more open today, so a restriction in accepting the foreign brilliant people is not a good choice for any country. As the leading country in the world, US should play a good role to let more diversity culture.
