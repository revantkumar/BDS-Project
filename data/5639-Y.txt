Sherry Wu To whom it may concern, 

A 24 month extension to replace the current 17 month OPT extension would only better the quality of the workforce in the USA. It will retain those who are the most dedicated to their profession to their industry by having a greater chance to obtain H1B visa status. OPT is a crucial tool in pooling together the greatest skills from across the globe into one place with greater ease. By denying the OPT extension, in a way we would also be denying positive progress in globalization. 

Thank you for your time.
