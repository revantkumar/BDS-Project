I support an expansion on training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. Here are a few thoughts I have:

i) The universities' STEM programs will be more popular to international students. These students pay a substantial amount of tuition to support the schools. They increase the diversity on campus. OPT is also a very good educational experience which can be viewed as a merit of our graduate level education system compared to other countries. This will keep our universities advantaged when competing with other universities in recruiting undergraduate students from all over the world.

ii) Hi-tech companies and research institutes will be able to allow these OPT students to work longer. Many projects could not be completed within 2 years. It is a big loss that people have to leave before they can contribute more to the projects. Recruiting a new person will be expensive because he will be much less productive compared to those who has worked on this for a while. This will also improve the effectiveness of research fundings which are actually our taxes

iii) These people are also contributing to a substantial amount of taxes. Indirectly, the companies they work for will also earn more and pay more taxes if these people can benefit the companies.

iv) OPT students are after all interns. Unless the company wants to treat them as long term employees, most of them will leave after they gain enough work experience. I don't understand why people are claiming they steal American's jobs. They create value for the company which beats their foreign rivals and expands itself to create more jobs. Someone also says they receive less salary. How can you expect a new intern to earn more than other skilled workers?
