I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens. Not only that, as one of those who has faithfully paid taxes all of my adult life so that American children could get advanced degrees and better jobs than I have had and saved what I could of what was left after paying those taxes, in case my own children needed help to succeed, I highly resent it that these foreign freeloaders would go to the head of the line against equally well-qualified Americans because the government that is pledged to protect them has betrayed them instead!
