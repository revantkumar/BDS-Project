Longjiu Chen I have to say our stem students have done lots of work for U.S Eco. We have contributed to both tech area which local won't take. Meanwhile we have promise most the real estate occupied which means great contribution to tax. Also we are not causing crime to this country which means less burden for the local policy. Also we invest lots of money for local community and promote the growth of the county.
