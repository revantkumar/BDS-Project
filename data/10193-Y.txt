I highly support STEM Extension and hope it takes effect. The STEM Extension would be highly beneficial for students, technology companies, and US economy. 

1) for students, this would allow them to start a career without worrying excessively much about visa, so they choose the right career path, get experience and settle on a job that suit their skill sets and career goals before they rush into a long-term visa sponsorship commitment (it takes up to seven years to get a green card and applicants have to stay with the same company during the period).

2) for tech companies, the policy would make it easier to hire more talented students from the world and keep them for longer. Currently many companies cannot afford to hire international students because it's both high cost and high risk to sponsor them a working visa, and they really don't have much time to make an informed decision before the candidates' OPT period runs out; as a result, they just don't hire international students at all. This policy would allow them to keep a new hire for at least three years before making the decision about visa sponsorship. So the cost and risk of hiring international students would be much lowered. Thus, they get a larger pool of candidates to choose from and have a higher chance of hiring the "right" candidates.

3) for US economy, the benefit goes two ways - colleges and tech industries.
a. for colleges, this is a big incentive for talents to attend US colleges because they can get practical training after graduation. So more people would consider attending US colleges over European, Asian, and Canadian competitors. And those international students are great assets to colleges - both cultural-wise and financial-wise.
b. for tech industries, talents are key to tech companies' success. Since the companies would get and keep more talents, they can make more contribution to American tech industries. That's what makes America awesome.
