I strongly support OPT 24 months extension for STEM students. I'm a director in an IT company. If we only hire US citizens, our company won't last for next two years because we cannot find enough talented STEM students who really can do this job. We pay exactly the same for foreign students and American citizens. Students from other countries are very contributive. Thanks to their contributions, our business expands and we now are creating more job opportunities for both UC citizens and stem students.
