I strongly support the new OPT extension rule. I am an international PhD student majored in medical neuroscience. Based on my research experience, most of the research projects take at least 2 years. If our OPT program is too short, we might lose our visa before we finish the project. On the other hand, I think OPT extension is critical in attracting foreign STEM students. We are eager to apply what we learned in school/lab to industry or academic institutions after graduation. OPT program with an extension will definitely provide good opportunities for us to better transit from school to job market and to receive further training. Without OPT extension, it is hard to believe that US would still be attractive to international STEM students. I hope more people support the OPT extension rule.
