Emily Stewart I ADVOCATE for this proposal. 
1. Diversity is so important to us that we cannot afford racial discrimination which might be brought by opposing this proposal. The pioneers of Americans come to this land and enjoy the diversity and survive on the growth of Science. Without science, how can we keep ahead of other countries?
2. Foreign students come to our country at the cost of tuition and rental, etc. If there were not sufficient foreign students here studying, then a lot of apartments would be vacant, thus those apartment staff and managers will lose their jobs, directly raising the unemployment rate.
For these reasons above, please get this proposal APPROVED.
