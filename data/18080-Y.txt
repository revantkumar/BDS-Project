I strongly support the new DHS proposed rule of OPT STEM Extension.

I read through lots of the comments no matter they are with or against the proposal, now I want to state some facts to all of you that don't really understand what this proposal is about.

1. Most of the disagree opinions are accusing OPT STEM students of stealing the jobs from US Citizens which is not making much sense because the truth is - only the E-verify approved company could employ OPT STEM students and they are "required to ensure that the terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity are commensurate with those for similarly situated U.S. workers in other employers of analogous size and industry and in the same geographic area of employment." --- i.e. the employers are forced to fairly consider US citizen candidates first before hiring any OPT STEM student. 

2. Most of the disagree opinions are accusing the companies of hiring OPT STEM students for paying lower salaries putting the US Citizens out of their jobs - which is again not making much sense - because OPT STEM Program is designated to be training positions such as internships, research assistants, trainee programs which come with a lower wages themselves. Again, US Citizens are treated equal upon all these opportunities. 

With all the facts above I don't see there is any reason we should stand against OPT STEM students.

Instead, I think we should stand with them - International students created or supported 340,000 jobs and contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy during the 2013-2014 academic year, according to NAFSAs latest economic analysis (attached). 

So people, please see the real fact and support this beneficial proposal instead of letting your emotion blind your eyes!!!.
