The Optional Practical Training Program (OPT) is one of many programs that undermines the US citizen who seeks work in his or her own country. This program targets recent graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) who are from other countries. The result is that they get extra "training" and work opportunities, thus displacing citizens of similar and sometimes greater qualifications. Reduced wages also result from this program.

I have a mechanical engineering degree, and like many other STEM graduates, I am not able to obtain employment in that field. Instead, I have to drive school bus and perform farm and ranch work -- generally the same work I did prior to obtaining a degree. 

There is no shortage of labor in the United States, just look at the numbers of unemployed and underemployed. The employers, particularly for STEM positions, purposely create job descriptions that limit qualified candidates. Then, they complain that they don't get enough applicants. 

We do not need this program at all, and no sane person who cares about US citizens and the obstacles they face while trying to provide for their family would call for an expansion or extension of it.
