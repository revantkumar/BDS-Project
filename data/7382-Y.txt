John Lenski This proposed rule change is yet another way to create unfair competition to American citizens who graduate with STEM degrees and is designed to favor non citizens hear on student visas. The large US corporations have lobbied the corrupt Obama administration via political contributions in order to gain tax advantages by hiring non citizens at the peoples expense. In light of the high unemployment rate by our own college students even in the STEM fields this is an outrage to all Americans. By the way what happens to student visa holders who disappear after they get into the USA without even going to school? Does our corrupt government track them down and deport them? I think not!
