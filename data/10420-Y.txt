Somreeta Mukherjee I support the 24 month OPT stem extension but I strongly believe that the proposal should be increased to 36 months as that will give international students enough time to implement the knowledge they have received from USA. It will also give USA a chance not to lose the talented individuals and more international students will be encouraged to visit USA for further education.
