24 months gives students up to two chances -- maybe three -- to apply for an H-1B. Since even the additional Masters quota is subject to a lottery, there's a roughly 10-20% chance the candidate will not be able to get through the lottery in that 24-month period and will have to leave the US. This is unfortunate. As a tentative fix, I would suggest allowing unlimited STEM OPT extensions for 12 month periods to people that have made a good faith attempt to apply for an H-1B but were not selected in the lottery.
