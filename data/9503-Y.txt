According to the research conducted by NAFSA, international students created 123,465 Direct Jobs + 216,543 Indirect Jobs for the U.S. I believe that the Americans who could not find jobs now and blame international students still could not find jobs even though international students leave, because the reason for them could not find jobs is they are not working hard enough or having high-quality skills. The policy will bring much goods to U.S. economic development.
