I support this proposal, because this proposal could attract more talented students to come to pursue higher level education in the US, and also join the US industry. Currently the institutions in the US benefits a lot from the admissions of the thousands of students from China, India, and many other countries. Also the employers in the SF bay area and other places in the US find there are many potential young graduates from the other countries are very outstanding even compared to the US citizens and these foreign students just ask less. This proposal could make the US research and industry much stronger.
