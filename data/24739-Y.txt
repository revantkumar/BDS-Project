This proposal will absolutely benefit the US economy and society in the long run. The US economy greatly relies on technological innovations. STEM graduates are trained in the US: the majority of them are talented and hard-working people. They can bring more innovations required for the sustained growth of high technology in the US. Because they need time to develop great innovations/projects, without the STEM OPT extension, many of these talented graduates would've been forced to leave this country without major contribution to the US economy and society. What makes America the greatest nation on earth was, is, and will be the openness and innovation. People, please vote for national interest, NOT for individual benefit.
