I strongly support this policy. My advisor is an American, here I will quote my advisor's words "United States is a free country, it's free market here, competition and cooperation should be encouraged so that this country can thrive". 

US is leading the world in innovations and technologies, the reason for that is the welcoming environment and the encouragement of free cooperations all around the globe. Innovations will thrive if new blood is keep coming. And opening up this gate for the free market is exactly the essence of this country which is freedom.
