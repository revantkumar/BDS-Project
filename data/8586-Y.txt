I support this policy for the following reasons:
1) It can benefit US high-tech companies with diversity in employees and also intelligence in their fields from all over the world.
2) It is great attraction for potential international students to come to the states to make contribution to the country. If they are told they have to leave or no one gonna hire them for 1-year OPT period after graduation, many students would consider other countries that have friendly policies instead of the states
3) It will not necessary hurt the rights of the us citizens. When a company decides to hire an international student, they already needs to provide information that they are not able to hire us citizens of the equivalent level. 
4) The working policies in European countries were used to be not international-student friendly, but it turned out they do need more intelligence especially in STEM fields to help their industry grow. Thus this policy really supports US to be the leader in science and technology.
in total, I'll say this is a win-win policy.
