I strongly support the new rule on STEM extension.

Most of the STEM international students work for high-tech companies that could not find enough US citizens to fill the positions. Forcing these international students leave the country is harmful to US economy. 

These students make big contribution to the country and pay high tax. 

America has always been an immigration friendly country. Because of that, so many talented people have come work in the country in history. Now many other countries start to compete for talented people, it would be a great pity if America would do the opposite.
