I believe that it is important for international students who graduate from US graduate programs have to opportunity to work in the United States, at least temporarily. Our education system invested in them and they should have the chance to use those acquired skills and knowledge to strengthen American companies which in turn can boost the American companies. They also bring a different perspective that can lead to much greater innovative ideas and foster international cooperation.
