Was reading some news about extension on OPT for F1 students a few weeks back. This is definitely important for both the international students and the United States companies. As there are more and more complaints about the limited headcount for H1B visa, extending OPT for F1 students, especially those majoring in STEM, becomes more and more necessary. Many talents will be lost by chance since they might not be able to obtain H1B thru lottery. By extending OPT, it allows more talents to work for US for longer time and get higher chance contributing to the economy of US in longer term.
