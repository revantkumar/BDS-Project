Sheila Liu From a STEM PhD students perspective, I am for the new rule. One of the many straightforward reasons is that, image what the composition of workforce would be without OPT extension. 
High-tech nature jobs are often the one that requires a long-term fostering and nurturing. However, due to the increasing risk of not selected by H1b lottery (without OPT extension), employers tend to factor in the potential risk of losing the international candidates therefore reject them. Thus only the jobs that are easily fill-in or substituted left which usually are the ones that dont require high-education or specific talents. 
To sum up, revoking OPT extension is equal to rejecting the talents.
