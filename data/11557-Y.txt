I do strongly support this proposal as it is good to keep the leading position of US in economy and technology areas, and keep the diversity of United States for which it always chases. Besides, universities and colleges attracted many excellent international students from different countries for their research in STEM areas because of this positive policy, which is also good for United States academic.
