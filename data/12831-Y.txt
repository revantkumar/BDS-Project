I believe this is a great move for several reasons:

1. This does not harm US citizen. Every year, only 85k H1-B foreign employee are authorized to work in US. That number does not change. The STEM OPT extension is just like contracted workers for very junior positions which more Americans don't like to take.

2. US need more technological based workers to fuel its economic boom, while there is a big gap between supply and demand especially at junior level workers. Termination of such rule will be disaster for the Valley and the further impact is unpredictable.

3. US, benefit from the global talent, will continue to be the most attractive country to attract the top. Closing the door means giving your privileged to others. Anyway, a US citizen or green card holder is much much easier to find a better job than foreigners. Why need to worry?
