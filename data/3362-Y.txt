I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons.

The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. institutions stay in the country and allow them to apply their knowledge to benefit not only themselves, but also this country.

Most foreign students I know are hardworking and eager to learn. It's 2015 now, and companies in their home countries don't want to hire students unless they've also got experiences. Students can get experiences, and our country can benefit from their handwork. 

Diversity is very important for the U.S., and many AMERICANS now who achieved something great, were also once F-1 students. This list includes Arnold Schwarzenegger, Madeleine Albright, Dikembe Motumbo, Ieoh Ming Pei and so on.... without them, our country wouldn't be the same. 

Competition does exist, but it is good for the United States. The foreign students did not take over jobs for Americans, it's because the positions did not find other suitable Americans. Competition helps our country to find better and well-qualified candidates and improve everyone's skill. This will benefit the Untied States to stay on top of all other countries in various of fields.
