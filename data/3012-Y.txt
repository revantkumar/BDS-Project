I strongly support OPT extension. This just provides an equal opportunity to everybody. A lot of protesters are obviously copying from this website: http://www.stopoverreach.com/ . Funny thing is none of these is a valid reason to oppose this proposal. Let me tell you why:

1. People complain companies will prefer to hire people with OPT than domestic workers. How ridiculous it is to even think this way! When I was in college, despite their impressive experience, a lot of my foreign friends were having a hard time finding a job, just because they are on F-1. That being said, consider two candidates with similar experience and skill sets, one being American, the other being foreigner, are applying for the same position. The American candidate would be in absolute favor to get this job.

2. People say companies pay less to hire foreign labors. Again this is wrong. Foreign workers are just paid as much as Americans at a similar position. They do pay taxes, and bring value to US economy. Also think about this, eventually foreigners need a work visa, and to get that, their employers need to show USCIS that their salary is no lower than prevailing wage, don't they?

3. People say they get laid off and are replaced by foreign workers. Come on! Everybody could get laid off. A lot of foreign workers get laid off too, not because of their lack of skills, but mostly because of a company decision to reduce cost. See? They lay off foreign workers to reduce cost, this again disproves the statement that foreigners are paid less.
