Dear Congressmen,

Please do not expand the OPT program for foreign students. American citizens need those jobs and it's time to stop giving OUR jobs to foreigners!! And, it's time to stop using OUR Social Security to expand such programs!! We Americans are tired of OUR government going out of their way to provide for foreigners instead of taking care of OUR own citizens all because employers might get a monetary incentive. The greed in this country towards OUR own citizens needs to stop!!! Send those foreigners back home as soon as their training program is over!! NO MORE EXPANSION!!!! Thank you!
