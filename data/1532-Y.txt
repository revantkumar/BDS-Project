Anonymous Anonymous I STRONGLY support to extension of OPT. Foreign students play a strong part in not only the work field but also the monetary value of many schools. With the stopping of OPT, Universities run a huge risk of losing many students who are paying more than 15K per semester. Furthermore, they deserve this right after paying so much for this education. The amount they have provided to this country is much more than a lot of people think. Lastly, the hard work and determination they put towards their job only motivates Americans to strive further and do better, it does not harm them in any way but make them better. If we bring a sudden halt to foreign workers, the government is going to have a big gap that they do not have the resources to fill which will definitely hurt the economy.
