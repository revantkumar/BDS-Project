I strongly support this new rule.

I believe stem opt is essential to the leading technology companies/industry in the United States. They need international students to fill the increasing demand for tech talents. As most tech projects in these companies take years to implement and it takes months to train a new graduate before he can do the real valuable things, OPT extension is a great idea to create a win-win situation for companies and students.
