Edward Pacewicz The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be 
a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. Most of these foreign students are in college on a 
scholarship which should have been given to an American student. In addition, these foreign students do not have the
burden to pay back student loans . The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been
pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly
in science, technology, engineering and the mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for
all tech workers. We give these foreign students an education for free and now we are giving them our jobs. Furthermore,
the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of
payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interest of American workers and students, not 
against it. I am a U.S. citizen exercising my rights to comment on this proposed regulation. Please make sure that any other 
comments are only from other U.S. citizens and not foreigners who are trying to influence our government for their own gain.
Do we give away our rights as citizens so easily?
