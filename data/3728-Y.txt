This proposal by the DHS to extend the OPT to 24 months is yet another slap in the face to American technologists.

I remember distinctly in the 1960s and '70s, the worries of my father, an electronic engineer, over possibly being laid off and being unable to find employment at competitive wages for a man in his 40s to 50s.

The OPT extension is essentially the same thing only applied to the opposite end of the age range.

If DHS really is in the alleged business of "Homeland Security", let it start by protecting qualified technologists from foreign invasion.

If DHS is unable or unwilling to do so, perhaps the personnel of DHS can be replaced by foreigners as well.
