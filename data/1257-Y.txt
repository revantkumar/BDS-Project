I think OPT visa for foreign students with STEM degree should be expand to 24 months. Here are the reasons to explain why this should be done.

Firstly, foreign students with STEM degree could make profits for the company or corporation that they work for. As we all know, the students have their expertise since they have the degrees on their own major which makes them ready to contribute their abilities to the profits of the company or corporation that they work for.

Secondly, they have good characterizations like working hard, be determined and be kind with people around which already proved during the process of obtaining their degrees. Determination and working hard are the essential qualities when they tried to complete the tasks from their professors. 

Thirdly, they have good communication abilities which make their contributions to the economy development possible. 

Overall, I think it is a wise decision to expand their visa valid time to 24 months considering the development of the US.
