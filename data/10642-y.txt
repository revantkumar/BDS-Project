Mike Johnson I strongly support this regulation.

Firstly, the international students are not paid lower which leads to Americans can not find jobs. It is known that if the company do not pay a reasonable amount of salary to them, the visa will not be verified. Perhaps lots of Americans have confused this well educated group with others. In the contrary, they contributed large amount of tax to US.

Secondly, US is so developed because of importing intelligent people and make them work for US. Stem students received the best education and have advanced tech, they are who US society needs. If they go back to their home country, it will be a loss to America.

Lastly, lots of international students come to America and consume, which is good for economy. Why do they spend so expensive tuition? The tuition is always 30 times more than their hometown's. Because they want to gain some american work experience after graduation. If they can not work, I am afraid they will stop pursue a degree here.
