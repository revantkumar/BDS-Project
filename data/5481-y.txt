Ethan Sharp I definitely support this rule. 
I work in silicon valley, I clearly know how important this rule means to our tech companies. By revoking STEM OPT rule, U.S. will suffer from tremendous financial loss. Also, it's so stupid to train these smart asian people and then send them to their home country :(
