This OPT will attract more international students to choose US universities over those of other countries, and thus eventually benefit the US economy. As far as I know, international students normally pay out-of-state tuition that can be twice or three times as much as what local students pay. Combined with living expenses, one student may contribute tens of thousands per year to the US economy, which creates more than one job for the locals.

United Stated is now a country that depends on its creativity, especially in the STEM area. Facing intense competition from other developed or emerging markets, US should arm itself with knowledge, which by the structure of the source of creativity, comes from everywhere in the world, not just US. STEM students in the US are equipped with the most advanced ideas and tools that will definitely benefit the leading workforce if they are applied in the US market. After nurturing the talent, US should keep the talents and implement policies to guide the talents to create an growing environment benefiting the Americans.

DHS has implemented sufficient methods to ensure that OPT workers are receiving the same compensation package as Americans, eg, OPT approval based on prevailing salary, e-verification, etc. As far as tax goes, the three-year OPT period makes it unlikely for students to retire in US and receive any social benefits.

I don't see why it is not a win-win situation.
