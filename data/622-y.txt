Dear Mr. Johnson:

I write to you regarding the Notice of Proposed Rule making (NPRM) on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. I graduated from Arizona State University last spring , I have been working with Amazon since last 4 months . 56% of ASU graduate students are international students and a vast majority of those are in the United States on F-1 visas. I and/or many of my colleagues will be strongly affected by the Proposed Rule.

I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I'm particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months.
I am a Software Developer Engineer at Amazon, In Amazon only there are 30% of all the new hires are on OPT STEM. This rule defines our career here in US. 
OPT and OPT extension is important to be because [Insert personal reason here].

I am very concerned with the possibility that the ability of students to make use of the STEM OPT Extension might be disrupted by recent court actions, upcoming court actions, and delays in this rule making process. I commend DHS for working quickly to prepare this new Proposed Rule.

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule and thank you for all of your hard work in keeping America safe and providing educational and training opportunities to F-1 students.

Best regards,

Harshid Thakkar
Arizona State Uni.
