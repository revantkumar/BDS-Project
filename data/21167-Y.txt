I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1.Why US attracts so many international students every year? Because they can find a job here, even if they don't get H1B in the first year, they still have another chance. But if you cancel it, what is your advantage against other immigration countries?

2. STEM students are QUALIFIED talents who can work in High-Tech areas, they create HUGE value for US economy. Some people may say that there are so many Americans do not have jobs, so they blame international students... That is SO UNFAIR!!! Companies hire us because we work hard, because we are talented because we can do the work better than you! 

3. My major is Electrical Engineering, I got my master's degree in US. 95 % of my classmates are international students. American students do not learn these courses at all. So, there is no competition at all. We just fulfill the task that are not capable by anyone else.
