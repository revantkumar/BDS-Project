I think the STEM rule gives a very positive signal not only to foreign students but also American's future.

These STEM students are among the best in their own country, forcing them to go back home will harm the long term benefits to of the states.

I see some people blame unemployment on foreigner take their jobs, i would like to ask: 1. What types of jobs are you talking about. 2. How many percent of jobs are STEM jobs. 3. Compare the absolute number of STEM foreign students with us citizens, this number is not that significant.
