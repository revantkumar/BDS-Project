Nancy Yang The STEM OPT extension is extremely beneficial to the US economy and the education system. It is a nice approach to attracting smart foreign students to study and temporarily work in the United States in their professional STEM fields. The US universities have spent great efforts to expand and improve the STEM programs, and it would be a total loss if the foreign students are not able to give back what they have learned at school to strengthening the competitiveness of the US in the high-tech world. Therefore, STEM OPT extension should be approved.
