ravisesank koganti The students can greatly contribute to the economic development of the country. After the extension, good students can stay in US to contribute more. The US companies do not need to worry about the h1b visa for new grads and can hire more candidates easily. Longer extension benefits US more. I am looking forward to witnessing the proposal to be approved!
