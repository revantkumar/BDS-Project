The Department of Homeland Security has proposed a rule to expand a program called Optional Practical Training (OPT). This program gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students over Americans. Our government needs to be standing up for and looking out for American citizens. Programs like these are the governments way of looking out for big business and providing them with employees that will cost them less than American citizens. These government officials should be ashamed of themselves.
