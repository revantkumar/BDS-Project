I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. Foreign students always have cool technical ideas to guarantee the security and freedom on the Internet, especially those who come from countries with deep Internet censorship. They would surely keep our works and products more competitive, everyone like such ideas but we do not understand how important they are. It's better to keep them stay in the US than go to Canada or Australia to make awesome things, because many of them said they do not prefer to go back to their homelands.
