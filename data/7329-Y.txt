Junwen Chen I think the expanding OPT is NECESSARY for the great America to attract more elites all over the world. In my experience of studying in a master's degree program of game development, we have come up with some great ideas only because of the diversity of our cultural backgrounds! The gaming industry will get ruined with no diversity!
And the reason why I chose to pursue a master's degree in America is because I can learn more in the university and also have a much better practical training with OPT extension. I declined the offer of the universities from England or Hong Kong, because it is much harder to get a practical training opportunity there. It is definitely a disaster for me and other international students if there is no OPT extension. What's worse, it will also greatly lower the attraction of American education and therefore harm the American world-leading competitiveness.
God Bless America!
