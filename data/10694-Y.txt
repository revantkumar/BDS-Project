As an international student, my tuition is very expensive and I only consider the price I payed worth it with the 29 months opportunity to work in the US. The opportunity or chance to work in the US, to learn in the best companies would worth my tuition. If this opportunity is taken away, I wouldn't suggest anyone to do their Masters in the US. 

I don't believe that I have taken the job away from the qualified American Citizens. If you go to any career fair, you could see that American Citizens are always given the highest priority, which I believe is the correct thing. According to my experience, if there are two people who have the same qualification, the company would take the American Citizens. 

As for the unfair competition that everyone is talking about, which says that generally international students would work for really low wages and therefore more appealing to the employer, I believe is not true. For my knowledge, the payment of my friends are good entry level payment. Besides, international students would require extra large amount of money for their employer to sponsor them H1B, which is most of the cases. If we only look at the financial side, I really don't think that would give international students advantage. 

I have many friends struggled to find a job in the US, some of them succeed, and some of them failed. There are many talented people who failed to find a job in the US, and went back to their home country. As for my friends who did successfully find a job in the US, I must admit they are very talented, smart people with great personality. I believe the working experience would be a good experience for them, and they would achieve some even better goals.
