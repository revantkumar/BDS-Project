The F-1 STEM student program should be abolished in its entirety !!
There are approximately 90 million legal U.S. citizens currently not working.
Many of those have the credentials to do the jobs F-1 STEM students are hired for. Protecting and serving legal U.S.citizens is your only priority!!
Expecting your support
