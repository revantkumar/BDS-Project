liuxue dang I graduated in summer, using opt for a contract job. after the 12 month of opt, Im on stem extension. Ill be in the h1B lottery draw next year. If opt extension can be 24 month, Ill have the one more chance to get a h1B, if I didnt get it next year.

I dont understand why there are so many people with high skills and great personality are forced leaving jobs and left US. US are pushing a significant amount of outstanding people to other countries.

If US dont provide more opportunities for us to stay, we will leave. Its the countrys lose.
