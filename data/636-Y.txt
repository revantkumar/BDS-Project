I strongly support the proposal because this proposal is to the best interests to both international students and the US. Many talented international students begin to contribute greatly to the development of this country after gaining their degrees in the US. Many people believe that allowing international students to work in the US may increase competition in the job markets which they don't want. This is probably true. However, it is this very competition that drives people in this country to work hard and strive to make their country the best in the world. Rejecting international students may relieve the intensive competition in the job markets in the short-term. But where would these talented brains go? They would go to other countries and contribute to their development. These most well-educated and talented brains are the power that drives the development of science and technology around the world today. Rejecting them would be a great loss to US in the long run. 
We talk about diversity all day. Why is it? not because it is what we supposed to do according to the laws. It is because it is a wise thing to do.
Being afraid of the competition is understandable. The best thing to do to get rid of this fear is not to reject hard-working talented people and lower the standard; rather, learn from them and get even better than them.
