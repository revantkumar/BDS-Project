As a US citizen, I highly support the extension of OPT.

I have some international college friends who have told me about this. I did not such a thing existed until later I looked it up online. I think the extension is extremely important since I know some of my international friends have landed some job offers and about to start. The job seeking period already took them a while (two or three months or even longer for some of them), if there is no extension for them, then they will only get couple of months left working in the companies. They will not be able to gain a lot of work experience and more importantly, they could have contributed to the companies, the organizations and this country more but they could not if there is no more extension. 

Moreover, letting international students stay will INCREASE not decrease jobs. Companies ship the jobs to India, China and many other countries with lower pay if they cannot hire enough high quality workers in the US. More likely, international students create more jobs by starting companies. According to Kauffman foundation, Immigrants were almost twice as likely to start businesses in 2012 as native-born Americans, and bout one-quarter of the engineering and technology companies started in the United States between 20062012 had at least one key founder who was an immigrant.

On top of that, OPT is a key fact that make American colleges appealing to those foreign students. If this is gone, then based on what I have heard, some of my friends friends who are from other countries have started considering applying for European colleges. The diversity of our community will be harmed if we have fewer international students here.

Thus, I highly support the extension of OPT. And I believe American people are wise enough to choose what would benefit us the most!
