Lacy kelly I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S.
Technology is the most important power to US nowadays,and most of those student could do very good in technology,without the help of new computer employee,many company may lack of people to solve many very tough problems.
