This is a fantastic program which I strongly supported. 

OPT extension attracts lots of international students to study in US, which brings prosperity to the local economics from real estate, retailers, to education and technology. I used to live in the rural country in the upstate US. However, the village is full of vigour because of the university attracting lots of young, intelligent, enthusiasm students from all of the world. They are the major economic contributor in the small town and i can't imagine what the village will become if this policy has to be cancelled.
