dhananjay joshi I strongly support the rule proposed by ICEB. The reason is simple, it lets me to contribute (although temporarily) back to the US Economy after I received my MS and PhD degree in Engineering here in US. 

This rule would also let US tap the best "brains" in the world and makes them more competitive than other countries. 

There are several examples in this world, where, immigrants have helped reshape the economic landscape of a region. Here in US, I recently (on WorldChanel.org) came across an example of Utica, NY (up-state NY region) where, local economic boost is attributed to the unskilled labor force who were "legally immigrated" to the US. Considering this example, I would argue that if unskilled immigrants can bring about this much change to the local economy, the skilled "non-immigrants" can definitely bring a great deal of positive changes to this country's economy.

Again, I strongly support this rule and request to continue to improve and expand the OPT opportunity for F-1 students for making US competitive.
