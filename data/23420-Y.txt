Honestly, I don't think the extension of OPT program will impact the working opportunities and wages of citizens. Since the OPT extension is ONLY authorized for students employed by "E-Verify" employers. The equality of working opportunity for everyone is guaranteed to be the same, for both citizens and non-citizens. The fast-growing high-tech fields require more and more elites to ensure the competitiveness of the nation globally. This large amount of work force is unable to be solely supplied by citizens. We need to bring in these students with STEM degrees since their knowledge and skills are great help for the development of the whole nation. For the concern of driving down wages, we should look at this in a reverse way. These students work very hard and contribute really a lot but with relatively low wages. As a tax payer, this means my money is used on the right thing to make the nation better and stronger. I believe the government will make the right call, we definitely need these students and two-year extension provides enough time for them to thrive and do something great.
