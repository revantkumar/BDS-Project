Kevin coltin I strongly support the extension of the OPT for another 24 months. Firstly, the US government and schools invest a large amount of money to train the international students. If those students leave the country right away after they graduate, it is a waste of the country's money. Secondly, the STEM students, especially those with Master or PhD degree, are in high demands, and they are the foundation of a lot of high-tech company. Thirdly, those people who claim that international students are taking their job is invalid. Because those people that are out of job are not well trained, and they can't get a position in the high-tech company anyway.
