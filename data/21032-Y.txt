STEM extension really helps both the companies and the students. The Optional Practical Training provides extra time to the companies to apply for H1B visa for qualified candidates ( talent not available in US). The current H1B Visa process which is a lottery process greatly hampers the retention of talent in US. The STEM extension process at least helps candidates to get an extra chance in the lottery system.
