I strongly support this rule. Because of this rule, I had a chance to work for a US company and support the development of physical metallurgy area. From what I learnt in the US university to applying them into industrial applications, I believe my job is beneficial for the US and even the whole human beings, since the technology is always promoting the human civilization. This is the American spirit that every one has a same chance no matter what he/she came from. This is the reason that makes US the greatest nation in the world.
