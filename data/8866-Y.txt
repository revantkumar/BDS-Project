Michael Avery International students bring money, skills and jobs in USA. Americans who engaged with international students while on campus are more likely in later life to appreciate art and literature, place current problems in historical perspective and read or speak a foreign language as per survey from duke university. STEM graduates should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide STEM graduates with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. This suggestion will not only give the F-1 students more time to win the H1B lottery but also will increase the revenue of US companies specially in tech and engineering fields significantly. This is essentially great help to US economics growth.
