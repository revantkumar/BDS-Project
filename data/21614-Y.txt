Big supporter!! So many jobs needs to be fulfilled by the international students especially in STEM field. The international job seekers pay much more effort to find interviews than the Americans. These efforts they put somehow will pushing them learn more and inspired through learning. It is because the hardworking of immigrations making the US strongest country in the world. Accepting workers from the rest of the world make this country diverse and inspired! Hope the Americans won't give up such a good tradition.
