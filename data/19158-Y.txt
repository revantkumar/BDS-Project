I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S
2. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Foreign students with OPT will not take up the work opportunities for American because STEM work opportunities give priority to American
3. High tech companies creates opportunities for other industries. For example, Uber creates opportunities for drivers. OPT students are essential for High tech companies since High tech companies usually can't employ enough engineers from native citizens
