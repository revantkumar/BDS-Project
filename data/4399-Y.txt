I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S universities have the chance to make contribution to this country.

2. I do not think there will be a job competition between U.S citizens and these international students. As we all know, international students need the sponsorship for H1B, and Green Card, etc. which will cost the company a lot of money and effort. And not every company could do that. Due to the sponsorship, if there are both U.S citizen and international student satisfy the position, the company will choose the U.S citizen without any doubt. And for the few jobs which international students could find, basically there are no qualified citizen candidate apply that, and the task need to be done.
