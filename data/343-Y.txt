I support this rule. 
It's astounding to see people oppose this because they think foreign student would take jobs that do not belong to their whiney individuals in the first place from them...
The most offensive thing about this opposing force is that it represents everything that America is not. This is a country founded by immigrants for god sakes. This is a country where contributions made by immigrants grow the economy and create jobs for all americans.
If you are afraid of losing your jobs, here's the hint: stop your whining; stop running to court; suck it up and step up your game.
why? Because this is America, where the smartest, hardest-working people should win. Because this how America become the greatest country on planet earth.
