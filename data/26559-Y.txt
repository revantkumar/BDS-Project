This revised proposal for the OPT extension deserves applause. It is beneficial to take certain amount of competitive international talents while the DHS take every necessary measure to safeguard American's interests. As it has been quite clear from the proposed statistic that NAFSA students had made a contribution of $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy in a single year 2013-2014, the payroll deduction from the employer can be deemed as trivial compare to this annual procurement. Meanwhile the government has provided strict systematic control in the control of immigration, particularly for STEM OPT period, it guarantees each aspect of the term and conditions would take American's interest first by providing commensurate measure with those applicable to similarly situated U.S. workers, and none of the domestic workers will get laid off by introducing the OPT students. The audience regarding this matter mistakes the immigration intention and the practical training, latter of which facilitates sufficient resources and trained personnel in connection with specified opportunity. I would vote yes for this policy to get approved.
