This is a typical case where the CEO ends up with all the money by hiring cheap foriegn students who will end up in staying in this country.

As law makers you should fix the law where corporations are prohibited from hiring non American citizens, and your obligation is to train and educate the U.S. student to have a career that contributes to our economy.

Let us hire our young workers, train them in good work ethics to grow up to be productive citizens.

We need to reduce the unrmployed and not give them food stamps.
