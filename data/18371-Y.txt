While it seems international students are taking jobs from America's land, it occurred to me that we've been creating jobs that otherwise wouldn't exist: international student service, ESL exams, TOEFL exams, English Language School, international-oriented scholar programs, and the list goes on. So the argument that international employees steal jobs from Americans is invalid.
