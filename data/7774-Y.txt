I think it is necessary to support the 24-month extension for International Students. Us can become so prosperous is mainly because the multi-culture, people from all around the world contribute their knowledge for this country. It is a win-win for US because only when the market is a perfect competition market, the potential and the best of the market can be activated. I know maybe this regulation may harm the benefit of some people, for some locals, these international students can become their most competative competitors, but when competition occurs, why what they do is not try their best to improve themselves instead of using the government to refuse the competitors out of the country's door. That's too ridiculous.
