This president hates Americans.Our young people haven't yet wised up to the realities of a technical education, but 
this rule will permanently create an American underclass of angry graduates who will now NEVER get a chance to reeducate
themselves.Moreover thousands of aliens will become necessary fixtures in our workforce...How long before
they start joining the "progressives" in a push for citizenship. Haven't we had enough of this guy abusing our people in
favor of aliens? Stop him. I am a retired attorney that worked in the labor relations area. Rules like this are killing
our chances to catch up. Once they are in...that's it.They stay.Stop this rule call your representative,especially the gutless 
republicans that have been pushed around repeatedly by this anti-American president,and unfortunately that's most of them. Without our pressure, the rule will go through because the mainstream republican hacks won't do anything unless they feel the pressure from home. Some democrats who fear what might happen when this madman is gone can be swayed so if you live in a dem district don't sit on your hands.LPM
