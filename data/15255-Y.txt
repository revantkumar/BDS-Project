STEM students contribute a lot into U.S economy growth, especially in hight tech industry like Biotech, computer science, software/hardware development, and also very important to the U.S society diversity.

Cancel STEM will make huge impact on U.S economy, also, U.S university will become less attractive to foreign students. In my opinion, U.S government should make STEM extension even longer than 24 months, and make it easier for all high skilled foreign students and talents to find a job in U.S, and be wiling to stay in U.S to contribute to U.S economy growth, instead of expelling them, and let them work for other counties.
