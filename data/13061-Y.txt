I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Student studying in US should have the chance to serve in US. Or it will be waste of time for US university and college to spend the sources. For example, the high quality of US high education provides the students ability to create things in the field. If those students have to opportunities to serve here because such regulation, they will have to go back to serve their homeland, which is not benefiting to US.

2. The students bring in diversity here. And this is a critical point for all US companies and governments. Also this proposal will show the following students and the rest of the world the opening of US to all talent people.

3. The students stay here will not take the opportunities from local people. Mostly students in US will stay in hightech companies, and no government related area. And there is a lot of rules for them. Therefore not a company will spend time and money for a low position. For those positions they prefer residents in US. And competition is always the thing driving US forward.

4. The truth is a lot excellent companies are built by international students who stay in US. Yahoo is all well-known example. Ren Ng, a PhD student from Standford University, starts his own company about a fashion camera, which leads fashion now. This contributes to the economy and education in US.

To sum up, I am greatly agree with this proposal.
