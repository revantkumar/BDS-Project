To whom it may concern:

I am in F1 visa right now, and I am working for Bogue systems Inc. My first year OPT almost end, I do need STEM to continue my work. I am doing well here, my supervisor said so. But me and my company don't want my visa will be the only reason that I can not work here. 

I need STEM!!!!
