Dianshi Li The new OPT extension rule is definitely a large improvement for the existing one, which has big benefits for America's industry, as well as for OPT holders. 

Each each, there are several hundred thousands students who come to America pursuing higher degrees(BS, MS and PhD) in science, technology, engineering and math. Those students, no doubt, are among the most excellent groups at their ages. They are the most potential human resources for America's industry, especially for the high-tech industry. Just taking a few minutes to go over the statistics on the employee's diversity in some big IT companies, you can easily find that more than 50%, even more employees in Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, etc are actually from other countries. and you can also count how many famous companies are actually set up by them. Those people, students today and can be great people tomorrow. The value of them cannot be estimated more. America needs them! 
However, if they cannot stay here to make contribution due to expiration of F-1 visa, they have to go home. America will lose a lot of valuable human resources. This lost may be more than hundred billion dollars! Due to the more and more tensive H1B application, more than 40% of those students cannot get H1B application in the first year. That means more than 40% of them have to leave America, leave America high-tech industry, which is the core industry of America. What does America lose?
A lot of positions of big and small high-tech companies will be empty. Many extra efforts, money, time has to spend on recruiting new people and training them. A lot of smart people will make contributions to other countries instead of America......
More examples can be easily given to emphasize the importance and benefits for the new OPT extension. In one word, it is an more important rule for America than the OPT holder.
