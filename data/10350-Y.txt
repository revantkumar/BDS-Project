I do support this proposal. Foreign students try great efforts to get better education here because this country could offer great training and practice opportunities in industry. Students majoring in STEM, they especially need more legal time to get themselves equipped by internship. With longer OPT, firms are more willing to hire these students since they are able to get involved in more projects, rather than just jump in and jump out of projects soon due to short OPT. With OPT extension, I really think it is a win-win proposal. For foreign students, it is their choice whether to stay in this country or return back to their home country. If they decide to go back home, with more experience in industry during OPT, they will get more decent jobs and get their tuition and efforts made in US paid back. If they choose to stay here, that means they have passion in this country, want to make contribution to this society, it is a good thing, as well. So I do support US to provide more training opportunities, such as OPT extension, to foreign students, and to attract more elites here.
