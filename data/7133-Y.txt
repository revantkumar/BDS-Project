Haiou Qu I strongly support this rule on OPT extension. International students come to America to receive the best training in the world. After graduation, their still sets will no doubt be needed by US. As a matter of fact, in the form of OPT training, numerous talent people have already made tremendous amount of critical contributions to the technology and economy of US while receive much lower compensation compared to not only American workers but also the values they have created. Additionally, there is no such thing as stealing American jobs. There are only qualified and unqualified people. If after OPT training, a student can demonstrate that he is the top in his field and successfully land a job after competing with many others, which, of course, include American applicants, it means that this particular individual is the most suitable for this position. In terms of contribution to American society, it does not matter whether the individual is an American or not. Only how much contribution has an individual made matters.
