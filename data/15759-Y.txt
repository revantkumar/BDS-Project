I think prolong the training oppptunity for STEM student is necessary not only for the student himself but also for the USA resident and comapny.
As I know, in the microsoft, the foreign employees in the big percent. Actually, not just Microsoft , a lot of analogue Tech corp existes the same stituation. And this company contribute a lot of benifits for US goverment I think. As the techniche develop, they need more freshmen join. 
In fact, we immigrant students work in USA, we are contriubte our time and sweat for USA. It's good for the America's development. you nurture us, we flourish you. it's perfect.
other hand, it's better for us foreign student's personal development. maybe it is no relationship with you. but I think we all member of the earth and if we can do something brilliant thing. maybe it can help all of the peoples in the world. hah it hears like a joke, but we can deny its' possiblity. 

I support prolong the trainning opptunity for STEM foreign student. because it's a double-wins situation
