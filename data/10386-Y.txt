The United States of America has been providing a fantastic opportunity to students and researchers to come to this country and pursue their education/research. I believe that after graduation, it is the time for students to return the favor to this country by hard working in companies and industries and keep their knowledge in this country. Without OPT extension, a great subset of this group must leave the country and it is a loss for both people and the United States. I do strongly believe that 24 months OPT extension will benefit all of us. This will give the students time to file their H-1B visa, since the lottery system is in place for H-1B. I appreciate your efforts to bring this rule in timely manner. Great Job DHS, Thank you!
