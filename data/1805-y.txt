Jenny Wang I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.

2. We actually just want to have more chances to improve ourselves, this definitely matches the spirit of each STEM program!

3. During the period we work in the U.S., we actually help U.S. to become better. Otherwise, it is meaningless for U.S. universities letting international STEM students study in the U.S.
