My parents were immigrants and worked two jobs for most of their lives. They raised three children, paid their bills, paid their taxes, and worked hard all their lives. My sister is a CEO, my other sister a history teacher, and I work as a librarian. My parents were fortunate as they were able to come to this country and get citizenship. As a country of immigrants, we should never turn our back on immigrants, especially immigrant students who will learn so much and contribute so much here. Please make it easier for them to extend their visas after they graduate to stay and work in the U.S under the Optional Practical Training Program (OPT). They deserve it but, more importantly, we do too. Their contributions are priceless.
