Jenny Weng I think this is a good extension not only for STEM students, but also for the U.S.! Because lots of universities have thousands of the international students studying in STEM programs, if there is no more extension, studying in the U.S. will not be attractive any more. Then it further will generate a series of other problems in academy, economy, employment, etc. Also, each country wants geneius working for them, contributing to it! Geneius in science are important for each country! If US does not have something to attract them, they won't contribute their knowledge, skills to the U.S. any more, at the same time, other countries will get the benefits.
I don't think this is what US wants to see.
