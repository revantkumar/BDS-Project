Are you serious thinking that the international STEM students are taking our jobs? Let me tell you the truth. The truth is that most of the my friends, as citizens, they have NO interest in STEM at all. They love arts; they fancy in law; they prefer financial. Who's gonna facilitate the whole industry? The international students with highly proficient skills. Let's thank god to bring them here and support our industry to keep progressing.
