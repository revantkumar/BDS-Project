Strongly support the new rule considering OPT extension!
The reason the high-tech company pick international students, is just they are so excellent ! The master course for them is like a piece of cake! They could finished the project assigned by professor only in several hours, and get a great grade , but for others they need to spend days on it and still struggling ! For students excellent like them, why shouldn't they deserve a great job and contribute their talent for the company ! The union just want all the competitors get out of the US and left them get the jobs no matter they are qualified or not ! This is discrimination and anti developing progress! Without the OPT extension program the US would loss huge amount of talented people ! And it's gonna loss a lot of international students ! And the workers here will loss their jobs much sooner and the unemployment rate gonna raise much faster !
