I strongly support this extension.
First, isn't it the American spirit that we should respect people with abilities and knowledge? Should we treat everyone equally?
Also, think about what those international students can contribute. It is not about them taking job opportunities from American people, it is about what kind of talents those companies need. For example, software engineer, high tech hardware enginner, companies have huge demands of these kind of talents. So it is a win-win situation for both of the international employees and the USA.
Let's show our respect to those people who can prove their values to this country, and make it a better place!
