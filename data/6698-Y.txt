Why would someone think they are taking our jobs away?

1.These work require very specific knowledge. And the reason OPT exists is that we haven't supplied enough qualified American graduates!
Go to a college and get into a Computer Science class, see how many Americans we have there.
So if you want to blame someone, blame the education system.

2.Big companies don't pay less to those foreign students, check our regulations! They have to pay even more for those OPT students.

3. Look at our report numbers, we are having less and less unemployment rate! Check the Fxxking NEWS!

The number doesn't come from killing competitions! 

Anyway, the reason that U.S. can be the best country in the world is, thank God, we have enough people working on these high tech field.
