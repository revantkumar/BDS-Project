Aaron Wong I strongly support the OPT extension opportunity for F-1 Nonimmigrants Students with STEM Degree. I believe what empowers America today, talents, no matter he/she is born in US or not, is one of the keys. Dates back to half a century ago, embracing talents from all over the world laid the foundation for rapid growth after WWII. Nowadays, one of the biggest engine what drives Americas economic growth is high-tech industry, in which employees from foreign countries playing big role in. Many of them starts with F-1 status and continue working with optional practical training (OPT). The new OPT regulation would relieve the stress of H1B-cap lottery for many working international students working with OPT or OPT-extension. The loss of 17 month OPT extension has already exposed much pain for the OPT workers, if new regulation doesnt come out, many would have to leave current occupation, not to mention the impact on prospective international students.
