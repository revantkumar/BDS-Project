I totally agree to expand the opt extension to 24 months for STEM major. Majority of the companies in America need a large number of science students and there are more than thousands of tech positions have trouble to hire science talents. There is a large capacity in job market for science students. And from a global perspective, allowing sicence students from different countries to work longer in America would help tech companies in so many aspects, so I believe it would be a brilliant ideal to expand the opt extension for stem majors.
