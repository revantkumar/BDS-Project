Ellen Hu I strongly SUPPORT the STEM extension new policy. I live in Cambridge Massachusetts, and I know much technology and tech companies contributed to the GDP of the country and the atmosphere of the tech prosperous of Kendall Square. More importantly, STEM extension will NEVER harm job opportunities for the U.S. Citizens. First, if both an U.S. Citizen and an international STEM candidate are qualified and powerful candidates for a tech position, a company will still prefer to hire the citizen. Second, the new policy will benefit MORE U.S. citizens in fields other than STEM because in those fields less employers will be willing to sponsor H1b visa to the international candidates. They know that the total amount of H1b visa will not change, but the probability of STEM major winning the H1b visa increases. That basically lowers the probability that non-STEM majors winning the lottery, which makes less of the employers willing to take the risk. In other words, this policy is actually gaining more work opportunities to citizens from all the non-STEM fields, which have lot more job opportunities than STEM fields. Obviously, this policy is not only a way to attract more STEM experts from all over the world to maintain the countries' tech global position, but it also will benefit the citizens by saving more non-STEM job opportunities to them. Since It won't change the total amount of H1b visa winners every year, it would only gain STEM internatinal H1b candidates more opportunities from INTERNATIONAL non-STEM candidates, but NEVER from citizens.
