As an international student, the STEM extension is extremely important to not only help me find employment in the country but also give companies a chance to get the best talent in the market keeping visa status aside. International students are essential to keeping the US Economy at bay and keeping corporations staffed to ensure continuous improvement and research. Also, universities earn a good portion of their money through international student fees which is at least 4 times an instate student fees. Therefore, the 24 month rule will aid in attracting students to join universities in America. In the absence of the rule, students will no longer want to study abroad, thereby reducing the money earned by universities, which then reduces the amount universities can spend on research which again reduces the development of the country. I am strongly for the implementation of the 24 month OPT extension rule as I believe it not only benefits international students, but also benefits companies and the country itself.
