I'm a first year master student in Georgia Tech and strongly support OPT extension.

First, why we foreigners come to US,rather than England, Germany or Japan to pursue higher degrees? It is because of OPT. OPT gives us chance to work in US. And that is why US can keep attracting world class students to study and work for it. Without OPT, US would lose its attraction to the most brilliant students in the world.

Second, many of us come to US because we know that there will be 17 months OPT extension for STEM students. It will be unfaithful to cancel it.

Third, STEM students are working for those greatest companies in US. And they have become the foundation of these companies. Without OPT extension, those great companies will lose their energy and cannot keep growing fast. This will influence US economy a lot with no doubt.

Fourth, If US companies like Google, Uber and Facebook want to explore China market, they will definitely need Chinese students' help. We are like bridges between US and China.
