I do not want any laws past that work in favor of hiring foreign workers.

I am in favor of legal immigration but we have too much immigration at this time. 

There are too many unemployed American citizens

There is too much immigration legal and legal that is lowering the standard of living.

All foreign students should be sent back home after earning an education.

Reducing foreign students would also be helpful. If would help free up space for our students to go to school.

Furthermore the added burden of to many immigrants is causing government to expand too much. This expansion is causing our national debt to rise and increasing the long term burden on our citizens.

You may not fully appreciate the extent of our national debt.
Quickly approaching 20 trillion. With 500 million citizens (+/-) that comes up to $50,000 per citizen. That is every citizen whether they are working or not. $25,000 of that has all occurred in the last 10 years (Thanks to all the damn liberal democrats and moderate republicans)>

Bringing more immigrants in is not fixing the problem. It only causes lower standards of living and more poverty.
