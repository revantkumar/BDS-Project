I strongly support this proposed rule. There are a few reasons.

1. America needs talented people to help it stay #1, and STEM international students play a big role here.

2. Extending OPT not only help those talented international students stay here and help America become great, but also it may give some international students more chances to even start their own start-up, hence help U.S. job market and provide more jobs to Americans.

3. We should distinguish between legal immigration and illegal immigration. international students in STEM are definitely not cheap labor, instead they are beneficial to the whole country.

Thanks for your time reading my comment.
