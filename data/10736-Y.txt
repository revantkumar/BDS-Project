I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S, a lot of international students have great achievement in the U.S.

3. It can help U.S. have the best people in it.
