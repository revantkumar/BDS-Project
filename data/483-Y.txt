What makes America a great country is that He allows every man chase there dream equally. The prosperity of America is founded on the efforts of both US citizens and immigrants. Steven Jobs' parents are immigrants, Barack Obama come from a immigrant family. America is incomplete if you ignore the contribution from the people all over the world.

The reason that America takes the leadership in the world is because he could always attracts the elites around the world, and make himself greater. Actually, the current rule for H1-B visa is very strict. Only those people who are extinguished in some fields could work and live in America. They work hard, pay taxes and contribute to this country, all they ask is a better opportunity to do this.

That's what I'm about to saying. This OPT extension for STEM student will not give any benefit to international students. It just give them more time to find a job and wait for H1-B application. It's totally fair for US citizens. Everyone in this country will work hard for a job equally, that's what American Dream about.

Finally, I want to tell those who opposes against this proposal that, if you have some economic knowledge, you will know that the job positions in a nation is not fixed. It doesn't mean that each international student steal a job from Americans. If one person make great contribution to the economy, he will create more jobs. The most effective way to create jobs is to develop the economy, that's how international students contributes to this country.

I know Americans concern about immigrant issues. I think this could only be fixed by encouraging legal immigrants and regulating illegal ones. As the leader of the world, American should not fail to those who chase their dreams.

As an international student, who came here inspired by American Spirits, I hope I have a better opportunity to contribute to this great nation.

Thanks you all.
