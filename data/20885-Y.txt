I would SUPPORT this proposal with following reasons:
1. Demand is HIGHER than supply, hiring international student will help US economy

The demand of science related jobs are actually much higher than number of US citizen who has enough knowledge and experience to fill these jobs.
Helping US company to hire more international student actually helps company to have the enough man power to create product and services to gain profit and create even more jobs after that.

2. Employer CANNOT abuse OPT to lower "labor cost"

The market plays the role of the "invisible hand", employer cannot decide the salary by its will. The salary is determined by the demand and supply. 
A lot of international student who graduated from US colleges are earning much more than what us citizen earns. For example, a number of international students who work under OPT extension work under IT company. These students earns from $50000 to $100000 annually which is way more than average earning in United States. In addition to that, when these students got hired, their salary is determined equally with their co-workers regardless of their citizenship status. There is no evidence showing that companies are abusing the OPT rule to lower their labor cost.
