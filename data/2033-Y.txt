I strongly support this OPT program for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities, what comes with those international students not only their learning ability but also their consumption ability which will have and already had a positive effect on our market and economy. At the mean times, the increasing job opportunities in the education industry is another evidence indicates their beneficial effect.

2. The reason why we started OPT program focused on a simple fact the best way to learn is by doing. During this OPT process, those international students can master their academic knowledge and it also helps our society to select and absorb the brilliant citizen. American society is a diverse one, and what keeps it as a world leader is continuously let them staying in the country and keep making contributions to the U.S.

3. I have to admit competition does exist but is not a bad thing. Beside international student do not get their job using any unfair measures.
