I support the extension and I think such extension on STEM subject can greatly help united states' engineering advancement.

From the universities I graduated, a national science funded center has a percentage of 80% students from outside of US for the program. After 4-5 years of PhD or 1-2 years Master study funded by US tax payer, it doesn't make any sense to just limit the time period of these high education engineers. 

The company I currently work for struggled to find us employee that possess required skill set. We have government projects that have no other approach other than to hiring foreign STEM graduates, who has contributed enormously. Again, such situation can not be solved by limit their OPT period. On the contrary, shorten their work period will increase unnecessary wast of our HR resource
