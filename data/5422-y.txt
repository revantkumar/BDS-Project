Maria Estabrooks Clearly these proposed regulations are detrimental to Americans and thus America. Government in the United States was formed to protect the people and it's borders. Instead, you are assisting in putting Americans out of work, jeopardizing our safety by admitting people who wish to destroy and take over our way of life, and putting your personal beliefs above the US Constitution and Americans. What will you do for Americans? Why haven't you eve feigned an interest in our jobs, safety, and respect in the world? It is apparent that you have another plan for America regardless of what we want. These attacks on 
Americans are unacceptable.
