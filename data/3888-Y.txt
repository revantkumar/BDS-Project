I strongly support this rule since this well in turn help the economy of the nation. The knowledge that the students receive can in turn be used towards the development in all the sectors of the economy. It encourages diversity, knowledge growth, new thought processing, value added to the community, prosperous nature, good international relations etc. There are a lot of positive sides to it than the negative ones. In an era that we are in, a combined force of knowledge is much better than the isolated knowledge base. So I support this cause and urge the necessary authorities to encourage this process.
