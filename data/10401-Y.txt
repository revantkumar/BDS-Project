Chun HE I strongly agree.

OPT won't affect job market for native Americans. In fact this OPT extension is only for STEM majors, where insufficient amount of US workers can meet the market demand. Without this regulation the IT industry can be affected badly.

In most job areas other than STEM foreigners don't have any chance to get employed. 

And if an US worker is looking for a job in STEM major, he/she is usually considered first since the company won't have to pay for the visa application. There is no way that OPT regulation can hurt US employment.
