This is essential for United states to attract foreign students to pursue higher education in America. This is a significant advantage that United states has over Europe which makes it a suitable location to pursue further education for students especially from the developing nations. I would recommend making this OPT extension 36 months to give the students time to properly apply their education and making foreign students a viable candidate for companies who are looking to hire young people with passion and expertise in their field of study.
