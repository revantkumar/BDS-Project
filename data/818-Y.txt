Deborah B. Roberts As a tech company employee, I strongly disagree the claim that STEM students take away our jobs. 

First, if we don't offer STEM students chances to work, we are going to have to face a SHORTAGE of high tech worker. 

Second, STEM students create great companies! Instergram, Google, Tesla, each of these company creates billions of revenue, and thousands of quality jobs! 

Claims like "STEMs take away our jobs" are quintessentially short-sighted. Our nation is the greatest nation because throughout the history, we were constantly able to gather the brightest minds from all over the world. If we want to keep our throne in the 21st century, we need to keep it this way.
