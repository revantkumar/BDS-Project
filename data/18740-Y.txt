I give consent to this proposal.

From last year H1b visa amount granted by USCIS is no longer satisfy the total applicant capacity. Especially this year the percentage of selected applicants from the H1b lottery dropped a lot which kept many foreign employees and candidates of many industrial areas from a stable working status and potential opportunities. And this could only get worse if current market and human demand of industry is as good as so far. The truth reflected from the phenomenon is as long as market is blooming and more technology development is in process for many industry areas many companies start to get expanded and demand additional employees. People possess technical knowledge and experience of industry are valued by them and also the society. However, the fixed H1b capacity can't attract more keep foreign human resource to dedicate in this country.

This proposed improving and expanding OPT policy could apparently extend the service time for most of these employees and candidates. By not only several month direct visa extension but also mostly 1 more time of H1b application opportunity. By complimenting the decreasing percentage of H1b selection this policy could effectively suspend the cap of human resource. Otherwise a big and increasing amount of STEM degree employees would have their current visa expired and no way to extend during their most promising career period in US.
