I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their fair share of taxes.

Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it violates the foreign student's F-1 visa pledge to leave the country after completing their degree. 

With college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.
