I strongly support this proposed rule. This definitely is a win-win strategy for United States as well as international students. I am working as a data analyst and our team needs to find people with strong quantitative background, programming skills and great sense of responsibility. Most of the resumes we get are from International students. Without the OPT Extension program, it will be very hard for us to find new team members. It usually takes several months to get a new employee fully on board. One year OPT is not long enough for them to make fully use of their knowledge and working on the projects. Our team built statistical models for our clients, which needs to be updated and maintained biweekly. We also need to rebuild models for our clients every half a year to keep the model effective. With the OPT Extension, there will be less transferring of responsibilities and we can work more efficiently. 

I am really shocked to find so many negative comments who object the rule. STEM students will not drive US citizens in all industries out of job market. The proposed rule only allows international students who got their STEM degree in US to work. It is illegal for them to work in other industries which do not require a STEM degree. Yes, sometimes it can be hard to find a job. But, please be aware, it is also really hard to find the suitable people to fill openings. All companies have a preference towards US citizens if they have the same skill set and capability. It is because citizens can work without any restrictions but international students need sponsorship. 

So, let's face the reality. STEM students are not taking jobs from US citizens. However, if you do not have the right skills that companies are looking for, it will be hard for you to find a job, no matter whether you have a citizenship or not. Skill and experience matters.
