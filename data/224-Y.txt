Jianhua Huang It is glad to hear about the potential opportunity of extending the OPT for STEM major to 24 months, and I strongly support this decision. 

There are tons of jobs that needed the students with extensive training in the STEM major. The US economy depends on the experts with the necessary skills. Without the support from international students, most company will probably collapse.
