I was told by one of our international employees that i can send the comment here. I work for a start up company near Bay area and i'm the HR. When our company started 2 years ago, we cant find that many Americans especially Engineers to work for us. Since we are too small when we started, we cant attend the career fair of colleges and we also tried to post ads online, but we didn't receive that many resumes from people in our country. But fortunately, we received a lot of cv from foreign students. And they work hard and are smart which makes the business of our company blooming. To tell the truth, i know a lot of companies in our areas are facing the same problem of unable hiring enough employee because they are start up and i have viewed some negative comments and was wondered "do they really know the case"? Some of them said foreign students took away citizen's job and list the amount, but i think the amount is the total number of jobs got by foreign students last year. So those who list the numbers of jobs taken by foreign students actually do not want to give a single job to foreign students at all. I highly doubt those idea since US has kept giving people from all of the world chance since it is founded hundred of years ago. Also there are some post about low wage of foreign students. And i can promise that at least our company give equal wages regardless of nationality. 

The most important reason is that most complainers have no idea that how long it will take to find an engineer and train them to fit into the companies' business. Currently is it usually the case that it will took 3 months. But if lots of them can only stay in country for 12 months, then they only have 9 months to work with high efficiency and after that we have to find someone new and repeat the process which is very annoying.

So i highly support this extension.
