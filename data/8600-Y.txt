I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. They spent much more tuition to learn knowledge in US and they deserve the right to apply what they learn to work in this country. 

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. Many brilliant foreign people became students in US before they service this country.

3. Competition does exist, but is it a bad thing for US? I do not think so, HR will pick the best person for each position. No matter if there are international students, if you are good, they will pick you. Everybody is equal and everybody has the same chance to find a job.
