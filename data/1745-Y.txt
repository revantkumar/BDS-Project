The vast majority of international students are top students in different countries. This is especially true for PhD students. Because they have potentials, the US schools are willing to spend 5-7 years and $ 300,000 - 500,000 to train them. Those are a lot of resources. But more and more school are still willing to do it. Why? Because these peoples have strong abilities, the schools and the country are hoping to gain much more from them after they are well trained. If all of a sudden, these well trained workers need to leave US before they make any contributions for the country. It is the US that will lose the most.
