I strongly oppose cancelling OPT extention or any act in the spirit of discouraging qualified foreigner from working for American employers legally.
It will be tremendously detrimental to US economy.

To be more specific, I will use myself as an example.

I work in the credit risk department for a US community bank that participates in CCAR exercise in compliance with OCC Federal Reserve. Most of my colleagues in my team are recent international graduate students on OPT. If OPT extension were to be cancelled, most of these students will end up leaving; this will leave the credit risk department severely under-staffed; potentially causing the whole bank to dysfunction.

As far as I know, at least in the quantitative fields, international students do not take jobs from Americans at all. The reason most of my colleagues are internationals is that nearly all the applicants are international. In fact, American job seekers are privileged in that companies prefer to hire them as no visa sponsorship is needed.
