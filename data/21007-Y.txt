I'm an International student in major of Electrical Engineering and I entered the college in US. In my opinion the OPT program not only benefits the international students themselves but also the natives because the equal job opportunity can bring more rate of employment as well as vast improvement on US society in a long term, and those international students who succeed to win a job will endeavor to produce even more social values; this is a country we love just as well as the native does, and we all who live within want to witness its great development. That's the reason why we want to endeavor for this great opportunity.
