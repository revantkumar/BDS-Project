I think OPT extension is very important not only for foreigner workers but also for US citizens. The reason why US can lead the industry especially in high-tech area is that most talented people come from all over the world and decide to do great jobs together with Americans here. Most of these people came here first as a student and then became professions. If OPT extension is canceled, many high-tech company will face human resource shortage and not so many citizens have the ability to substitute their places. This will definitely affect the development of these high-tech companies. So I suggest retain OPT extension policy.
