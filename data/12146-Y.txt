I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. For most of the engineering jobs, it takes no less then one year to build a system. If there's no OPT extension, MOST of the projects could not be carried out.

2. America has meet the growth of IT industry, and international students are so important to big names like Facebook, Google as well as many many start-ups. There won't be so many students coming to America to study and work if you have a bad visa policy.
