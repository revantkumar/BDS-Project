I think this is a great policy that reflects what Donald Trump said in the debate. You gotta let talented people come and come legally. If this policy gets implemented, the United States will benefit from it. These STEM students pay taxes when they work and many pay for their college tuition all by themselves. Sometimes the tuition comes from their family abroad. If international students have the oppourtunity to work for two or three years here, there will be more and more parents sending their kids here. Money will flow in and help both public schools and private schools. How is this a bad thing? Plus, these students come here with valid visas are well documented. It's not the same thing as letting people from one of our neighbors cross the border illegally and stay.
