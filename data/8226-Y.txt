I cannot imagine why people keep saying it is horrible to let the forgiven people to work in US. If it comes to that, why on earth the University enroll so many foreign students in the first place? Just deceive the international students to contribute money to University to solve the financial crisis? Have you guys think about how irresponsible your education systems are and the horrible influence has been put on our international students. It is already very hard for us to work in this country and this will make it harder and harder. I know it is nothing to do with the citizens but it is just a 3 years extension and a lot of people still need to go back to their country. Don't be so selfish, people think they did something good to themselves but a lot of times what they did will jeopardize themselves at last. This is called short-sighted.
