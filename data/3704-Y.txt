I'm a foreign student who has finished undergrad and master degree in USA. I would love to see US government put proper level attention in improving the current policy of OPT/OPT extension. Since the working experience is also important for students. I believe, USA, as the leader of technology industry as well as the country with freedom and belief, will make its effort to improve the OPT policy for STEM F1 students.
