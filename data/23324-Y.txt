I support this proposal undoubtedly. 

USA is a country of great diversity. Diversity is beneficial and necessary to the country. Different people make huge contributions to the society, especially those people having high-level education background. This proposal could encourage brilliant college students from all over the world to have enough time to make improvements in certain industry field, even breakthroughs with the knowledge they learned. Without these young and smart students, our industry could not develop as fast as it does now. 

Also, the number of start-ups is increasing nowadays. Quite a part of them are formed by college students. New start-ups could provide a lot of job opportunities for USA, which is helpful to maintain the social harmony and increase people's average income.
