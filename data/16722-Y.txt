I strongly support the proposal of OPT extension with the following reasons.

Firstit allow international students valid time to finish their research in United Statebecause some scientific researches do take at least 2-3 years. So OPT extension is really necessary for STEM students. Such support benefits their research also contributes to the academics of U.S.

Second, OPT extension attracts international students to get education in U.S. Many countries are always working actively to attract international students, such as England, Canada, Australia and Singapore. Attracting international students not only enhances education revenue, but also rises the reputation over the world. OPT extension helps attract excellent people to America, who would definitely make contributions.

Finally, many people have already in their OPT extension. If the extension is canceled then. How should those people do? It disrupts their research plans, internships and practice after graduation. It will also let many e-verified companies and institutions have a great loss if a lot of international students leaves because of no valid VISA status. It is really a satire to the integrity of U.S. Such action will decrease the reputation and frame of America without any doubt.
