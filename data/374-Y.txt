I strongly support the proposed rule.

1. By improving and expanding training opportunities for STEM international students, U.S. can retain the best and brightest students around the globe and facilitate U.S. to keep its leading role in science, technology, engineering and mathematic fields.

2. U.S. STEM industry needs international students to fulfill the growing job market need. Recruiting STEM international students helps technology industry better understand the emerging market, expand and strengthen their business in the global market.

3. While living in the States, STEM international students' consumption benefits the entire U.S. economy from catering industry to housing, from automobile industry to airlines, and most of all the higher education industry. In that sense, every working STEM international student will create multiple jobs for U.S. workers.

In conclusion, the proposed rule will benefit every interest parties in the conversation. It is a perfect interpretation of President Obama's executive action on immigration reform. The proposed rule is also a brilliant policy produced by USCIS. It should be appreciated and implemented as soon as possible.
