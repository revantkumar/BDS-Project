Dear Officer,

I am graduate student in Computer Science who has 8 years of experience of working in IT & Computer Science and technology with several Industry standard Certifications. 

I want to comment that in absence of a comprehensive and specialized Highly Skilled Migration program, no modern country can think of moving to path of progress. Infact the current STEP OPT program is only bridging this gap. International students in anyway do not pose a threat to local residents because of absence of a level playing field. Even if they are able to survive in this competitive private sector job, then rest assured they would come up a positive change in US economic and Job sector which would ultimately benefit US Citizens and non-citizens alike.

I strongly commend for this 24 months rule and would urge that a clear path to of absorbing and benefiting from International graduates should be rolled out.

Thanks a lot.
Sincerely,
Hongmin
