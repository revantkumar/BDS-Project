HI from Silicon Valley:
Give legal Americans a chance! The new generation needs jobs, and I know how hard it is for
new college grads to find good jobs: they can do anything someone from India or China can,
and we need to look after our own first. I am not opposed to foreign workers but not at the cost
of Americans getting the jobs they need.........what family would starve their own children and
feed the neighbors?
