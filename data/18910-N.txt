Hello, I have lost 3 jobs to foreign workers over the past 15 years and I am about to lose another. My income has dropped to 1/4 of what it was back in 2001. All thanks to this government favoring foreign workers and students over American born workers. As an older STEM worker who cannot find a STEM JOB, I am not happy with all that you do. I have to take whatever job is offered to me at whatever low pay it offers, 

John Miano, attorney representing tech workers:

the proposed rule effectively "requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination."
"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit."

Professor Norm Matloff:

If the U.S. indeed "needs" the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training?
If workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans?
OPT expands the pool of YOUNG workers....this is the core of how SCE, Disney and so on can legally save lots of money by hiring foreign workers -- the latter are younger, thus, much cheaper, than the Americans they replace.

Ian Smith of the Immigration Reform Law Institute:

"Like other employment-visa programs, OPT works to lower the wages and living standards of a growing portion of the middle class."

So, you are happy with putting people like me out of work, and you are happy with lowering my pay through your actions so that I am no longer in the middle class it seems. 

Sincerely,
Don Miller MS IT
