I STRONGLY SUPPORT EXPANDING OPT STEM POLICY

The international students with STEM degree is an important part to keep the USA the most powerful country. We are facing a competition from China, Russia and India in technology and economy every day, and the majority of the foreign students in science and engineering are from these countries. The current immigration law makes it very hard for these students to work legally in the United States even if they are hired by the high-tech companies. If we force them to return to their home country, they will only support the tech companies in their country and our highest level education system is just teaching and training students who work for our competitors. By setting up this OPT-extension, these students will have a chance to work in the United States and contribute to the industry here for at least 3 years and possibly longer if they apply for other types of visa later.

Let's support this new OPT STEM policy to keep USA the MOST POWERFUL country!
