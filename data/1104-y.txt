Shreyans Kothari This rule will help skilled immigrants pursuing STEM education to further contribute more to what they have earned and keep continuing to do so for a sustainable growth of STEM work.
I appreciate the actions taken by DHS in taking this to Federal Register and would like to see this convert into a rule to aid the STEM community.

I support this initiative and look ahead to its establishment and inclusive and mutual success of all.
