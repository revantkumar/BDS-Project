I believe the expansion of the F-1 non-immigrant students with stem degrees is a very bad idea for a large number of Americans. The Center for Immigration studies indicates that 430,000 Americans were unable to find work between 2009 and 2013 due to the existing program for these F-1 students. 

Also, because these students were not Americans, Medicare and Social Security lost out on collecting approximately four billion dollars during this same time period. Both of these programs are in severe need. Why exacerbate it? If the idea is to be more competitive, then we should focus on providing American college graduates in stem fields every opportunity to find work. Not drive them away from it due to favoritism to foreign nationals. 

So it seems, this proposed rule will hurt the young and old alike. It will make it more difficult for a college graduate to find work, and it will hurt retired Americans. How is this a good thing if we are concerned about middle class Americans in any way shape or form. There must be some select set of individuals who would benefit greatly from this. I am not referring to the foreign nationals, but to rich and influential Americans.
