Dear Officer,

I write this comment on behalf of my company that located in Texas. I am a project manager of a hardware group and I have several international staff in this project. As a leader in this group we have a mixed culture and I really enjoy it and both of them have great passion on their work that bring great benefit for the company. However, some of them are still enrolled in the OPT program. If the program is terminated we will possibly lost them and the lost can't be imaginable. So please make a expanding for the OPT and give the students more time to stay here! Thank you.

Yours sincerely,

Tim Jeu
