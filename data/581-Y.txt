I strongly support the new OPT extension rule. As a Computer Science PhD candidate, I really appreciate this great country that gave me an opportunity to study the state-of-the-art information technology. I have been working with the most talented professors and students from different countries for years in our department. I also collaborated as a summer intern with sharp engineers and scientists of various backgrounds in LinkedIn Corporation, which is one of the greatest high tech companies in the US. The US is the only place that can gather top geniuses from all over the world.

All this can happen because of the foreign student program and, most importantly, the CPT/OPT rules. These rules allow me to acquire more knowledge and experience here. They are actually the reason that brought me to the US and made me withdrew offers from Canada, UK, and Hong Kong. Without OPT extension, most foreign students including me will have to leave the US within 1 year. We will not be able to be involved in any significant project that lasts for more than 1 year. We will not be able to contribute to this country in return. Even worse, the resulted brain drain will make the computer science industry in the US not attractive any more.
