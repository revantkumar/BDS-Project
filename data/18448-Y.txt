I definitely support this proposal. 
Taking my company as an example. We always have research program in Human Interface Interaction every year. The program needs so many researchers. And one program would last two to three years. Every year, we can find a lot of appropriate international students as our candidates. But we cannot recruit them because of their identity. Nobody can guarantee if these students are able to work in the U.S until finish the research.
If the government prolongs their OPT to 3 years, it would be perfect to us. You know what, although we can find excellent domestic students. Less of them like research. Well.. most international students like doing research job.
