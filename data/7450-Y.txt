Andrew Law I agree with the OPT extension for the following reasons. 

1. OPT extension is only applied for STEM major students that means they are highly educated people from our country. If you just let them go back to their hometown, we may lose hundreds of thousand talents every year. And the policy will have a great influence on whether they pick up the US to get a degree.

2. The OPT extension students get low pay and do the work most American students don't like to do. Therefore, the work force is still stable and robust within the students come in. Unlike hundreds of thousand uneducated illegal immigrants move to the States every week, the OPT students can do highly professional job and do it very well in helping our economy. And it takes only in hundreds of thousand people level. 

3. We should take a good care of them and distinguish them from illegal immigrants. These students are young, highly educated and talented, with low pay and high performance in many specialized areas. Furthermore, they pay the tax on time and receive little help from the States. As minority, it's a pretty good idea to guarantee an OPT extension to take good care of them. At the same time, pay more attention to the illegal immigrant issues.
