I believe this new STEM OPT extension rule will surely enhance US economy, employment opportunities and competitiveness.

Currently there are as many as 50,000 workers in STEM fields working for various core industries such as IT, High-tech, and Manufacturing. If the OPT extension rule were revoked, most likely countless US companies and organizations will suddenly lose competent employees, and years of effort and investment spent on training them. In the long run, revoking the STEM OPT extension rule will further hurt the willingness of STEM major students, who were born outside of US but received high education in US, to contribute their knowledge and skills to US economy. US companies will also face the problem of having fewer choices when recruiting qualified employees. 

Additionally, the 24-month OPT extension allows STEM students more time to prepare for their start-ups, which will bring more job opportunities to US citizens. As a STEM major student, my long term goal is to start a company that provides cloud-based intelligent devices. My research area during M.S program has been focused on designing affordable intelligent medical devices, and my invention has already been brought to third world countries and helped people there. I believe there are numerous job opportunities that highly-educated STEM students can create, and this new OPT rule will definitely help ensure those new job opportunities are created in US.
