I support improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students and extension for F-1 OPT period. Many technical positions like software engineer, quantitative analyst consist of many F-1 students working under OPT. The extension of F-1 OPT has a tremendous impact on American industry, economy and future global competitiveness. So I vote for the extension of F-1 OPT.
