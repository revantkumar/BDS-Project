Ailin Liu Liu This proposal is definitely GOOD. 

Competition does exist; however, it's NOT a bad thing. This is always a FAIR competition as F-1 non-immigrant students NEVER exchange job opportunity with low paid.
In fact, international students fairly compete with Americans and at the end take certain positions because the employer cannot instead find suitable American employees.

The person who is stronger stands longer. Competition helps American to become better and more competitive. At the end, it leads United States to a stronger and more competitive nation.
