As a technology worker I have seen corporations rely on cheap foreign labor at the expense of American technology workers. The flood of cheap foreign labor has destroyed any motivation for American business to train or maintain Americans. American business has no motivation to train when foreign labor is so plentiful. This is hugely destructive to the American middle class. These are good paying middle class jobs. We should be encouraging training programs not discouraging it.

My previous employer let most of their IT department go in favor of cheap foreign labor.
