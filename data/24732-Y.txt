I strongly and totally SUPPORT the proposal because:

1. Lots of international students can be allowed to study here and live here. Most of them are very excellent so that they can come here to get their study opportunities. The government should let them stay in the country and make contributions to the U.S.

2. More and more excellent people join this great country which can make only thing happen. That is, to make this country greater and greater.

3. If after finishing their study, then they have to go back their country, this policy will make more people, who plan to come, cancel their original plan because they think that this country is not ideal as they thought before.

4. If less and less excellent people want to come, the economics will be affected as well. I did a research before. According to the expense of international students in the St. Cloud State University, their consume improved GDP of St. Cloud in MN .55 per cent and provided 99 more job positions.
