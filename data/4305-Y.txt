Why are you so afraid of foreigners? Are you still afraid that they may grab you job? As you said, you are trained fully in 1950s and have so many years experiences, why don't find a job that can provide you higher salary? Competition is not a bad thing in the long run. The country need all the elite people disregard of their origin. If everyone can improve himself and done job better, the company can go better and provide more job opportunities. Everyone can benefit from this. Don't be so short sighted.
