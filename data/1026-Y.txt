As an international student working on my OPT over a year, I benefit so much from the OPT. I've got my H1B visa approved very luckly. There are friends who are so brilliant wasn't as lucky as me to win the H1B lottery, and the chance is around 33% to win this year. And it's predicable to be harder and harder over the years. Extended OPT will give us more opportunities to get H1B and have the possibility to build our career and chase our dreams in the US. This 24 month OPT extension will benefit millions of international students.
