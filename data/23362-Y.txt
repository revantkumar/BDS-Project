This proposed rule is pretty good both for international students and employers. The United States needs STEM employees by considering of development of the Country in area of science, engineering industry etc. Most employers have concerns when hiring international students because of H1B limitations, although they really require diverse working team. 12+24 months of OPT means 3 years gap time for new graduates and 3 times opportunity to apply H1B. Which also means more stable and diverse working environment for many engineering companies, and research groups. I don't see any harmful aspects of this rule.
