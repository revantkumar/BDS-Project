I can not believe why there are people against this rule. There is no doubt that OPT extension will be super beneficial to America's economy and social development!

From what I have seen, international students have done great contribution to the country. They work hard and make huge profits to their companies, and because of the Labor Certificate, they didn't compete with citizens for their positions, because before they get hired, it has been proved that the company can not find qualified citizen for the position. 

So hopefully this rule can be passed.
