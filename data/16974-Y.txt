I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons
1. We international students learn skills in the United States, and we are supposed to be allowed to make contributions to this country. In history, many excellent experts in science, technology, engineering, math were international students before they achieved great things which brought the United States lots of benefits. 
2. We international students are essential supplement to this country's diversity. The United States is a great immigration country, the most important reason it gots today's achievement is diversity. Different people with different religions different skills different backgrounds come here, brought different thoughts, then it becomes creativity.
3. We international students do not take jobs from US citizens because of the low salary, we are educated in the United States, and we learn many skills here, we get our job because we are really excellent and diligent. Competition exists, and competition makes this country a great country. We work hard to make us competitive, so allowing we international students work here will improve the competitiveness of the United States in the world.
