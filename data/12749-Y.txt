I support this OPT 24-month stem extension because people with expertise in science and technology should be kept in US. Thousand of smart people won't come to US for education if this rule fails to pass because once they know the chance to stay here is less than 30% for H1b lottery, they just won't come anymore. We will lose lots of clever people. US government should be smart to keep smart people here, not making rules to keep them away.
