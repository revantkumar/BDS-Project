It is unjust, shortsighted and against the interest of American people to deprive international students' legal right to work in US after graduation simply because they are not citizens. In addition, the belief that minimum wages cannot get raised because there are too many international students are also unreasonable and against fact. I am strongly convinced that allowing international students to prosper in the US would bring in far more jobs than the number saved by driving them out. 

1:Over the years, foreign tech workers contributed tramendous growth to the USA economy. If USA lose this force, USA loses a large portion of growth that the foreign workers bring about. Without policies like OPT-extension, it would just be a matter of time before USA becomes another mundane country where miracles no longer happen. Without the embraciveness of foreign workers, I can forsee someday very soon when USA economy stagnates, people lose jobs, and social problems arises. DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN. APPROVE the OPT-extension.

The request to place the right of citizens over non-citizens is simply RIDICULOUS. Just remember, every citizen or their ancester once was an immigrant.

As someone experienced in the tech industry, I can tell you with my reputation that the tech companies can never hire enough talents these days. Go ask the hiring managers and recruiters, they will tell you the same. Yes, USA probably has a lot of STEM people, but it simply does not have enough STEM talents. See, there is a distinction between normal people and talents. USA needs the talents from foreign workers to keep its machiens running well, and running better than the rest of the world.
