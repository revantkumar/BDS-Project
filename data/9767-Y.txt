I don't think the US Federal Government should stop expanding training opportunities for F1 international students. There should be no limitations about the nationality of people who can make contributions to the development of enterprise. Economy of America are recovering so fast, and job opportunities are increasing. International students will not have influence on the local students during the job applications. Furthermore, international students cannot get the same range of salary as local students. It can help save the cost of companies. So stoping expanding training opportunities for nonimmigrant students is definitly not wise.
