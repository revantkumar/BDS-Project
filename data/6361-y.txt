Anonymous I highly recommend to have the OPT STEM extension for all the STEM majors.

I am very much supportive to the 24 months OPT STEM than 17 months for both the current STEM students and future students too.

I wish this rule will be making soon so that it wont cause any havoc to the current OPT STEM working students.

Thanks
