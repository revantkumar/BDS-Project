My Daughter is currently in College and is the Child of an E-2 Investor Visa Holder. She grew up here in the US graduated a US High School but will be forced to leave and go back to a country she does not know. There needs to be a path for these Children to stay here in the USA and become citizens. She is an outstanding student and will graduate a Top US College but will then be forced to leave, breaking up our family.
