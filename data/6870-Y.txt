I strongly support this new regulations, the stem international students play a significant role in high-tech companies in US, this will benefit both the US economy and technology development. Imagine you have force all those talented students back to their country, US will lose a big group of well-educated people. And those student will benefit their own countries a lot. What's more, the stem education programs in most of US education institute will be affected because of less attractive for international students. Decreasing funds will also affect the tech development in US. At that time. Us will has less available positions. not just in stem area. the industry will affect every fields. 

If possible, I would support the extent it to 36 months.
