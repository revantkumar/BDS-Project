I definitely support this motion as this is not only an opportunity for the students with stem degrees but also a huge advantage for the American government to attract more students from worldwide and increase its revenue. I am sure no government is interested in loosing its MULTI BILLION dollar business. And when its easy to go to countries like Canada and get a PR, I think America is has a lot to lose if the rule is not passed.
