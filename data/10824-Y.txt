Yu Bai I strongly support this proposal and believe that it will benefit the economy and keep US companies competitive. My work is related to make bioactive molecules for anticancer drug discovery. The common period for a project is around 2-3 years. Increasing the OPT time will strongly support the postdocs to finish the entire project and discover more promising lead drugs, which is also benefit to the US people.
