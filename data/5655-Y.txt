I strongly support the new opt-extension proposal. Equality is a fundamental spirit which deeply rooted in the tradition of United States. This country should give the equal chance to work for natives as well as immigrants. Many talented international students come to study in US and have already made great contribution to this great nation. Through their effort, more advanced technologies have been invented, and many new theories in different fields have been established and improved. All of these bring a lot of benefits to the United States as well as her people.

Advanced technologies and science is the most significant power to boost the economy of United States, so this country needs more talents to make contributions to the economy. Due to the existence of opt-extension, many international students come to the United States to study and work in high-tech companies, advanced institutes. The opt-extension is an important aspect that attracts international students come to united states and make contributions to this country. If they don't have the chance to work here, they will not come to this nation, which would be a great loss to the development of United States, both in technology and economy.

In addition, people should admit that many international students are really talented and hard-working, which makes them very competitive in job markets. Natives claim that international students will reduce their opportunities to work. However, due to the existence of so many talented international students, this can make native students work much harder to improve themselves and improve their own competitiveness, so that they can become really qualified for different jobs. Lack of this competitiveness, the native students may put less effort in improving themselves, which in turn will really hurt this country.
