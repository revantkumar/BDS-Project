I strongly support the extending of the OPT period of international students.

The job opportunities are what attract so many international students to study in the U.S.
If we cancel the extension of OPT, a lot of international students may turned away and go to schools in other countries where they have more job opportunities. At the very least, this means there will compromise a lot of the school's income, since international students usually pay full tuitions and does not require financial aids. Also, it will cause a leak of human resources of the U.S. Brilliant engineers will turn away to other countries.
