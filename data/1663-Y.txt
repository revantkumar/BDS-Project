Qiuyun Zhu I am highly in support of the opt extension. 

It is not only benefiting the F-1 students, but also helping the economics in US.

Without giving an extension, the companies hiring the F-1 students will suffer a great loss if these international students could not get a H-1 visa to continue working in the company. Thus, it will be very common the company tend to hire US students even if the international students are really outstanding because of the fear to lose them after training them.

The opt extension means giving F-1 students a chance.What's more, it means to inject a new energy to the United States. Hope the federal can approve of this rule.
