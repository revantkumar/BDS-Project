I strongly support this rule. This regulation really benefits in three ways:

First of all, students in the science field need longer time to be well trained. Well trained workers will definitely benefit the companies.

Secondly, companies will not lose the talented worker just for not able to get H1B in one year.

Finally, this regulation really presents the equality in the United States. This could help attract more talented people from all over the world.
