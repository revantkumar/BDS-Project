Tejas Sethi I strongly support new STEM extension rule
I am working in a software company for almost a year now and I am getting 6 figure salary which I think is not a cheap labour
In my company there are 120 people, around 60 of them are in engineering team and ~60 in sales, marketing, HR etc. Out of those ~60 people in engineering team 90% (around 50) are foreign born.
There are many good and talent US citizens who are working in STEM fields but demand for STEM graduates is much higher and they don't find those many US citizens to do the job. Any company will gave higher preference to US citizen for the job because 
1. for foreign born STEM graduates on OPT company has file H1B and green card which costs them around 15-20K
2. There is no guarantee that a person on OPT will get picked up in H1B lottery
3. There is minimum wage requirement for hiring a person on H1B visa
4. There are so many restrictions on company for hiring a employee on H1B visa
5. Communication of US citizens is much better

In Spite of all these facts employer hire foreign born STEM graduates because there are not enough US citizens to do the job.
Unemployment rate for US citizens with PhDs in STEM is just 3.15 percent and 3.4 percent for those with master's degrees in STEM (http://www.renewoureconomy.org/news/new-report-confirms-labor-needs-in-stem-fields/)
