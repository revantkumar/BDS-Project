As a potential student of the United States,I strongly support the opt extension policy.Because outstanding students who benefits from this extension can bring more interests to American.
First of all,the International students help to improve the level of salary in many areas.Like one of my friends in the Bay Area whose parents are cleaners, he said that the original level of salary for cleaners in his area was really low.But as we know, in recent years many tech companies which employed much students from foreign countries blooms in that area.These companies pay more for cleaners and attract most of them.So the original companies in that area have to improve the level of salary for cleaners,too.If the opt program was aborted ,it will be hard for new tech company to keep the high level of salary for these cleaners because they will have to spend more on a suitable programmer.And then it is possible that all the companies in that area will pay as little as they did in the past to the cleaners.In that case,though seemingly that the cleaners are not related to the jobs in STEM,they will still suffer a lot if the opt was aborted.
What's more,if the foreign students fail to get a job in the United States,most of them will have to go back their motherland.They will bring the advanced technology to a country with lower cost of labors.It is absolutely possible that the job opportunities which should be for American are also chased out to the developing countries.Many start ups in China were created by returned students.Their companies have created much jobs for Chinese and draw much business from the United States because of lower price.If the opt extension was aborted,more students will return to their mainland and bring all the potential job opportunities to their countries which could be for Americans.
