I support the proposal whole-heartedly! As citizens of the most creative and innovative country in the world, we should always be reminded that our creativity, our thriving economy and diversity originated from and are deeply rooted in foreign immigration. We shall not forget immigrants' role in this country, what they have contributed in the past, what they are contributing at this moment and how much more they can bring in the future. 

In addition, I am also very confident about America's future generations because of the aforementioned efforts. Because of our history, we have grown to be such a powerful country in every aspect and developed unique qualities that make us stand out. Thus, I am not afraid of competitions. We should not be!

Thus, I urge all American citizens to support this proposal and let more immigrants enrich and inspire our country. After all, they are what this country is made of!
