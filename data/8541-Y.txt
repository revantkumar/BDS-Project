I strongly support to the proposed STEM rule and it is very helpful for all F-1 students who are under STEM programs. I always believe that USA is a land of opportunities and equal rights where everyone can pursue their dreams.

While implementing the New STEM rule it allows F-1 Students an opportunity to work and contribute to USA economy. Proposed rule give F-1 Students chance to again practical experience with mentorship and training program facilities from employers, it is great initiative taken from the government.
