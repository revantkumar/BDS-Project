Meng Xiao United State, as the most powerful nation on this planet, attracts many talented and intellectual students who are the best of the best in their own country to travel far far away to study in universities here. After graduation, they are even more knowledgeable in additional to the smartness they already got, and ready to contribute to the filed which they mater. I don't really believe it is a good idea letting them go back where they came from because a super power as we are relies on superior technology which is only sustainable by smarter minds. I am not saying that our nation cannot do well without them, but my point is they are more competitive because of higher education, smarter, and working harder in average, which is also why they may potentially jeopardize the interest of whomever not so good in the first place. It is an undeniable fact that they are just better, no matter which country to serve. The only difference is let them become one of us, or of our competitor.
