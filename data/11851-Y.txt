I strongly support the rule to extend OPT for F1 student. I read the rule and the comments, I here give my evidences.
I graduate from University of Boston. There are not only outstanding international students, but also a lot of citizen talents. Most students could find their dream jobs if they are good enough. The only difference is American citizens only needs about 1 month after-graduation to find a job while foreign student need to start searching and sending their resume 1~2 years before graduation, because the 12 month opt is not long enough for us to find the job. It was a very tough period for all international students if they want to find the job in U.S.
Second, always, most companies calculate the cost to accepting the international students and sponsoring the H1B. As I know, most of the local companies only accept citizens or permanent residents. For my experience, approaching my end of my PhD study, I applied more than 500 jobs but only get about 20 replies, most of them is just a phone interview. But when I move to San Jose, the percentage of getting the interview out of application just increased to 1/2. 
Third, foreigner is not only consuming jobs, they also create jobs. Youtube, Nvidia, Juniper, Yahoo, etc. Everyone is a seed, this land is suitable earth for them to grow, and when they grow up, they will feedback. Otherwise, if the earth is barren, the whole forests will dead.

So, I do think OPT extension rule could help create more jobs and keep U.S. leading the world!
Thanks!
