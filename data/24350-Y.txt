I do think it's necessary to have the OPT extension for F-1 students in STEM degrees. The former policy has been there for a few years and at least for IT companies, it works really well as those companies were able to hire talented new grads without too much concern about their eligibility of working here. Also don't you ever remember the American Dream? The "freedom includes the opportunity for prosperity and success, and an upward social mobility for the family and children, achieved through hard work in a society with few barriers". Why are those people against this policy so eager to set more barriers for foreign students working here? Don't foreign students have the right to work hard and earn what they deserve? Please take a positive attitude about the extension policy, work hard and make achievements, the equality and opportunity is not harmed by the policy, on the contrary, it's better supported by it.
