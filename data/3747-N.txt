The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.

I believe that all STEM students should go home to help their own country instead of staying here to rob a qualified American of a job. We have plenty of people who can't find a job because of foreign STEM persons. Send them home now, all who are here working and have been working for years. We don't need them, they are only here so that corporations are saving money paying low wages, which they can't do to American workers.
