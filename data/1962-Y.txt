I am not a STEM student but I strongly support this proposal. The United States has long been a melting pot and an open economy that create opportunities to people all around the world who live hard to chase their dreams. This is what makes US the most powerful country in the world. Currently the policies are extremely biased toward the natives, i.e. foreign students have limited chances and time to intern or work in the States. Many foreign students receive best-quality education in the US, and it will be for the good of the country to open up more opportunities for them to contribute to the economy. We have entered an age that talents are highly treasured without discriminations of their races, gender, nationalities, etc. What decides the next ten years of power in the world is talented people, nothing else. Smart politicians should understand that "baking a bigger cake" (develop the economy and create more job opportunities) is the fundamental solution to a lower unemployment rate and other problems. Economics has demonstrated that in private sectors, free competition brings out the optimal output. Protection or monopoly will only result in inefficiency. The Americans should not be afraid of this act even if it's in effect. You earn your position by building knowledge and skills, and the Americans already has an advantage over foreigners as English is their mother tongue. Not to mention that foreign students still face tremendous challenges to secure a job in the US due to their foreign status. Be self-confident and open-minded, because this will do good to the United States in the long run.
