This proposed rule of ICEB will be a great move to help students from various countries gain enough training in their studying field. Expanding OPT for STEM students to 24 months will bring more opportunities develop those students' potentials, pushing the fields forward, thus adding more talent lives into the workforce. I completed support this rule and wish it being approved in the end.
