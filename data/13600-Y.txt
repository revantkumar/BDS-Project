I totally SUPPORT this new OPT rule.

First of all, this will make more nonimmigrant students contribute to the US. They received education here in the US. If they just go back to their own nation upon graduation, they would solely do so little good to the US -- only the tuition fees, and it just feels like the US is training talents for other nations free of charge, which is not favorable at all. So, what we should do is trying to attract more of these nonimmigrant students to stay and work in the US, rather than pushing them away.

Also, expanding the OPT period will give these nonimmigrant students a better chance to fell what the US is really like, and attract some of them to join the US. These are real talents, not those who would contribute nothing to the nation, so I think they are welcome.

Last but not least, extending OPT will not affect the working opportunity of the native students. On one hand, this will not affect the working opportunity of the non-STEM students. On the other hand, the technical companies are already showing preference on hiring native students since they will not need support for H1B visa and can save them a lot of effort. Moreover, what technical field need are the truly talented, and the existence of more foreign talents can urge residents to study harder in college, which will eventually help thrive the technology.
