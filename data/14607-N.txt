I do not want the OPT program extended After reading about this program and this proposal it seems to me that this is an attempt to change the OPT from a temporary training program to a means to longer term work visas which allow employers to hire cheaper foreign labor and push Americans out of STEM jobs, Employers have a lot of incentives to hire foreign students. They tend to be younger and cheaper. They also save 7.65% with these foreign workers because they do not pay FICA and Medicare taxes. This costs the Social Security system 1 billion a year!! With all the talk about future funding of Social Security and Medicare I cannot believe a United States President and the United States government would make this proposal. 
All the politicians in Washington DC, from the president on down, claim they want to help and protect the American middle class. The OPT program will take jobs away from Americans and discourage American students from pursuing STEM degrees. I want to know how this proposal is helping Americans get better paying jobs!! 
I will also be contacting my congressman and 2 senators about this matter.
