The Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.

If this is such a good idea then why not let government agencies that want these immigrants to replace American workers hire these "students" for their agencies, lets replace government agencies with cheaper foreign help. Yes trust me I know that is not what is supposed to happen (in theory) but that is exactly what is happening and I have first hand knowledge of this.
