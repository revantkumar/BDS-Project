I support the OPT extension because it is good for the US economy. Many companies are hiring stem workers now. If this opt extension is not valid, thousands of companies will lose their well-trained and smart labors. Second, international students have spent a lot of money on the education in US. You know, it is hard for international students to find a job in US. When we are looking for a job, many companies said 'US citizen ONLY'. If stem students lose the opt extension, we will lose a lot of opportunities. We have to go back to our homeland! Additionally, only the companies who are e-varified are able to hire OPT extension labors. This kind of companies need a lot of technical labors. If the opt extension is canceled, where will be a huge loss for these companies even the whole country!
