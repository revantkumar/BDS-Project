Chuan He As an international student with a Ph.D degree, I strongly SUPPORT this proposal. First of all, international employers are not the reason for the reduction of job opportunities. The majority of international students have master or PhD degree in science or engineering. When they enter the job market, employees did not give any priority to those STEM nonimmigrant students. They got the jobs only because they are excellent and hard to be replaced. I just received a job offer as a Product research and design engineer, the HR said that it will be a huge lost if I cannot continue my work for them due to the OPT time limitation.
