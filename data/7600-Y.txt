Alan Bond I strongly support this proposal. Many students come to study in U.S. Why do they want to study here, not other countries? Because after graduation, the students can obtain a professional training for about 3 years. That's precious experience when they go back to their countries. What's more, if the students can work in the technical companies for a longer time, it will save the expenses of the companies to recruit new employees. As we know, in Silicon Valley, many engineers are not American citizens, they come here to build new technologies and boost the economy.

All in all, this is a great proposal.
