I sincerely support this new rule for STEM Degree F1 students!

1. America is a great country where keeping these young professional talents contributes their efforts to this society instead of kicking them out. Talents are the most great resources for every country! To win this global game, America needs to attract more talents around the world in the cycle and STEM extension is part of this cycle, without it, America will lost a lot of competitive young professionals. You could see that these STEM F1 student are the best in their countries, now they come and contribute themselves! We should welcome them with our great system.

2. F-1 students with STEM Degrees are those people who greatly help America economic growth and they not hinder any of local professionals or Americans find their own jobs at all. In fact, with these STEM students, companies create more jobs for local people as well. Someone may complain that F-1 students with STEM degree will get low-pay salaries and make other tricks to let companies hire them instead. However, it is wrong that actually they have more difficulties to find jobs because of their languages, cultural gaps etc. Young professionals use their hard effort to adjust themselves into this great country and why not give these people chances? 

I do want to write a long article to shout out all the benefits and goods for this new extension rule, but i think these two reasons are enough, God bless America.
