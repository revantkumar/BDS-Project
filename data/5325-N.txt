The OPT and it's expansion is another overreach of authority by President Obama.
He is hell bent on getting his way whether it is legal or not.
This is about ego and payback to America for what president Obama believes has been unfair to minorities, wjile the truth is America has been to kind, already.
Our citizens cannot afford any more welfare at the expense of their tax dollars and job opportuinities.
Stop this at once!
