I think we should expand the training opportunities for eligible F-1 students in STEM. Along with ten other interns, I did a little research on STEM fields. The key takeaway from the research is that STEM is key to innovation. Whomever has more people working in STEM fields will have a significant advantage over others. This is exactly why some other countries, such as UK, are trying to modify their immigration policies to attract international students in STEM. Competition for STEM is global. If other countries successfully change their immigration policy to welcome international students while that of the U.S. says no, we will see a decline in the number of international students enrolled. The current competitive advantage may be gone in the next decades as some developing countries, like China and India, are growing so fast. In order to remain competitive, the U.S. must be able to attract global talents, international students in particular.
