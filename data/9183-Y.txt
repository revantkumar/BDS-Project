This proposal should be supported by not only those who have benefited from OPT but also other United State citizens. What makes our country strong is diversity and elites from all the world. Different races make our society a colorful and attractive 'salad bowl', while elites from other country, culture give us the power of entire human being wisdom. Getting rid of study and work opportunities of foreign students will make us like India, China, Russia but not USA!
We offer best education to student all over the world, but after that they just come back and contribute to their own country. I think it is a waste of our effort to cultivate perfect people. It is a good idea to attract them with our working and intern opportunities. We should not only teach them, we need to keep them working for us. Obviously sometimes some guys will complain for position taken by foreign people. Well, I don't think it is bad for STEM relative position.. If you kick out all the Chinese and Indian at Silicon Valley, will our life be still normal?
