Charles Lucas (2nd Comment) That is good point Clif. If undermining our society and making a mockery of their sworn offices and the very foundation of our 
Democracy; yes they have succeeded. The immigration laws are not broken. They need to be updated and that's that. There
is no reason why we would allow the wholesale migration of illegals to cross our borders, but there is a power catch. 
Corporate America thinks that if they control the prevailing wage, bind us under huge credit card debt, bring the economy to 
the crash point, create enough unfavorable, to American's, trade agreements and outsource enough industry to put us into a
consumer only country, they'll control us completely. The fact that big business does not belong in the bowels or even the 
fringe of our Government workings and policies has been glossed over by capitalistic greed. The banks biggest and best deal was 
getting Congress to finally swallow The Federal Bank Reserve Act of 1913. 
If we are to make all things right we are going to have to call on the masses to draft a total sop of bandages based on how the
things went wrong and what we must do to prevent this from happening again. If we want this Government to be of the people, 
for the people and by the people we have to make it so. Will your Congressman take a huge cut n pay ,pay his own retirement
pay his own health insurance and live like one of "WE The People ". Could cost and profit control take the place rampant 
inflation? We are too smart to take this beating , but the young generation is convinced that the Government is all powerful
and can't be altered.
