Dr. Billie Thomas. Prof. Emeritius Please stop issuing permission for people with student visas to stay in the country, legally or illegally. I know many young people who are intelligent and with degrees that cannot find jobs that are 40 hours per week with benefits. I believe the universities are becoming corrupt. They want to make money rather than provide good education. Especially money that they can spend in any manner they want. We have many people in this country under employed and unemployed. If we need stem workers, provide scholarships for people to retrain in two years.
