Shame on those negative comments. The core spirit of U.S. dream is everyone could achieve success by working hard. Being a citizen does not mean one can sleep all day and enjoy welfare. I felt so pathetic for those trashes.

I hope legislate more and more rules like this one. Let us attract the most talented people all over the world rather than feed the worms of welware. I also urge U.S. government to convict and deport all the illegal immigrants. They are exploiting our system and we all know that the story of bad money drives out good. 

Welfare is drug. Stop meaningless welfare to the people who have absolutely no intention to work. Put the money on which it should be.
