I totally agree that
(1) the training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant STEM student should be expanded;
(2) CapGap for F-1 students should be expanded and improved.

In fact, this is one of the best chances, for our country, to take advantage of the most intelligent minds in the world. A newly graduated student, ready to work hard and thrive to make the world better --- for 80% people, that's the most productive time of the career. We should definitely let those smart F-1 students contribute to our country (versus a foreigh country)!

In addition, this is also good for us --- especially our universities --- to make money, from the tuition fees paid by these F-1 student. Many of them pay the tuition for an US degree and a few months/years of US working experience, which help them get better job when returning to their home country. Expanding training opportunities will ensure that US universities continue to attract the fundings from foreign students' pockets. 

As a summary, it's totally beneficial to our country, to expand training opportunities and improve CapGap for F-1 (STEM) students.
