I wholeheartedly support the proposed rule that facilitates the 17 to 24 month extension for current and prospective students in the OPT program. The STEM program has tremendously helped students to get hands on experience on the concepts they learned in their STEM degree program. I strongly believe that the theoretical knowledge is almost useless unless students learn to apply the concepts and learn industry best practices to hone their skill set. Coming from a consumer analytics background ,I clearly benefit from my summer internships and OPT employment where was I was given exposure to large real time data sets and expensive analytics tools that most academic institutions cannot afford to have access to. Also, new graduates in the STEM field are typically involved in new projects that usually take longer than 17 months to complete, and invalidating their employment status in the middle of the projects might hurt both the employers and the employees equally.

International students pay almost 60% more in tuition fee compared to their domestic peers and this extra income to the Public universities fuels funding for a lot of Research projects and Academic infrastructure and this in turn creates new jobs in the tech sector. Removing the STEM OPT Extension rule would create apprehension among students who plan to pursue their advanced degrees in the U.S. from Spring 2016 ( January ) on wards and hence it may affect the influx of new international students.

I strongly urge the DHS to implement this rule before Jan 1 2016, so that all the students who are graduating in Fall 2015 can immediately benefit from this and be reassured that they have a strong foreseeable future in their career.
