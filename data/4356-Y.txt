I really think that new OPT extension rule will benefit four parties: economy, the U.S employers, the people live in U.S and the students under OPT. Nowadays, many international student work for IT company. If they can work longer,there is no doubt that it is good news for U.S economy. And I also worked as a developer in a IT company. Only me is international students and I get long well with the American guys. My boss is very satisfied with my work and they hope me to work for long period.
So this new rule is very important for me and my company.
Sincerely
Shuna
