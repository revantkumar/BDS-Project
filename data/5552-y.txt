Xiaoyin Pei I am a student with a graduate level degree in the field STEM. I strongly support with this proposal.

First, after spending years of study in a graduate school in America, I think all STEM students need the time to gain more practical experience from industry. Many fields of STEM need severals years of practice and research to accomplish reasonable achievement.

Second, STEM students working in US can provide the country with enormous benefits. After graduation, many students will work in large companies such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc. Their hard working make the company thrive. The technologies they learn and implement provides good and necessary for these companies. If there is no STEM extension, many student will not have the opportunity and will not willing to stay in US after graduation, and there is not enough time for them to do so. The majority work force in IT field are Chinese students and Indian students. Without the extension, they will go back to their home country and work in world leading companies such as Baidu and Tencent which are strong competitors of IT companies in US.

Third, when working in US during STEM extension, students will provide large amount of income taxes which is indeed a huge benefit for US.

Some people would say these STEM students are threaten their jobs, however, by a deeper analysis, we can see the overlapping jobs are not a lot. In addition, the hiring processes of big companies are fair enough, every one can have a chance to work in them if they are well prepared for the interviews. Actually, going into these companies might be more difficult for foreign students since they would need to do much better than citizens to gain the opportunity.

To sum up, I strongly support the STEM extension, and wish it can be implemented as soon as possible, this will not only a good new for foreign students, but also can bring a large amount of benefits to America.
