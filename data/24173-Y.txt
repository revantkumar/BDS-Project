No other country on Earth concerns itself more with the business of other countries than our own. Though it's admirable to be so humane, at some point we have to start being selfish, in order to maintain the ability to effectively remain humane. It's time we start putting our citizen's needs before those of other countries, lest we lose that ability. We cannot take care of others if we cannot take care of ourselves first.
