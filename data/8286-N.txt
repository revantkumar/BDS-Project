With over 90 million American citizens currently either out of work, or seriously under-employed, many with advanced STEM degrees, there is absolutely no excuse to implement policies that give preferential job treatment to aliens (legal or illegal) over Americans. Honestly, I don't know what this government is thinking, but it certainly isn't about the welfare of American citizens. This is an example of exactly the reason so many people are fed up with the federal government and its polices over the past decade. This country is seriously on the wrong track.
