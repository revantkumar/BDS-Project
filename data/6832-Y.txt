Employment is the key to economy, and innovation is the key to economy. US should never rest on current technology advantages, it should be aggressively absorbing new blood in science and technology. In order to do that, just simply use the best talents all over the world! You got those young professionals completed degrees here and you want to let them go and make their own countries better, it would be too stupid for Americans to do that. If I were going to make a decision, I would ask all international students with the master and Ph.D degrees to stay. Innovation creates jobs, jobs in every industry. Just think about the industrial revolutions, we all need another one, and let US be the place. Or let them go, save this year's jobs, the high-tech jobs.
