Mingyang Xu I am an international student from China majoring in computer science. I could have gone to Canada or UK, or Hongkong, but I chose The U.S. because there are greatest companies in the world here. But without the extended opt I couldn't find a job within a very short period. I think that terminating this rule, the U.S will lost tens of thousands of stem talented students. The most important thing of a country is technology, and science, and most of the graduate stem students in the U.S are international students, can you image if a country lost 50% of their graduate stem students? it will be extremely major blow to the development of the U.S. Accepting the international students or foreign workers are the great advantage of America. For example, in nba, many of the players are international player, and that's the reason that nba is the top league in the world. It is quite simple how they succeed, because they accept foreign talented players. Based on the same reason, giving more opportunities for talented students in stem majors is the key of the success of the technology of America.

For me, I would like to work in the U.S company for a couple of years and then go back China. Because the experience in the U.S makes me more compatible in China. And I think most of the students, at least Chinese students will have the same idea.
But without opt extension, we even have no opportunities to work in the U.S for more than one year. That is a big lost for us and also for America. So I highly agree to the extension of the opt of stem students, which will be win-win cooperation for international students and America.
