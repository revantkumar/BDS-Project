24 months is definitely better than 17 months extension as it will allow for H1 application more time. I strongly agree with this part.
But the training and mentorship part is very discouraging to the employers. Lot of paperwork have to be done from their part. Employers have re-design and work through this which will discourage them from hiring STEM students. Because if they cannot follow the procedures properly they will be in unnecessary troubles. I definitely do not approve this part.
