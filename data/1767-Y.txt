Chung Chi personally I strongly support improving and expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 non-immigrant students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for ALL eligible F-1 Students. The followings are reasons why I support it: 

1. The government should provide an opportunity for foreign students in U.S. to make contribution to the society by using their skills and acknowledgement learnt from universities. 

2. Diversity is an important part for the development of the U.S. society. Obviously, there are many successful people who comes from other countries but make great contribution on the development of U.S. since they graduated from colleges. 

3. The competition among locals and foreign people does not exist. It is a promotion for both locals and foreign people to work together and fulfill their personal values for the society. The society will have more valuable people who can provide huge contribution to the society.

Based on these concerns, I truly believe that the extension of OPT for ALL eligible F-1 student is worthy and necessary.
