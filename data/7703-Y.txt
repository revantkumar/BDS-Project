The rule will help many great students stay longer and contribute to US. But I'm also seeing upcoming issues of H1b threshold. The chance of getting H1b will continue to decrease with more and more students staying on their OPT. I'm all for this proposed rule and hoping the next step is to expanding the threshold of H1b application accordingly.
