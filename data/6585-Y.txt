Docket Number: ICEB-2015-0002

The OPT extension policy is by all means a win-win policy. 

First, the United States of America could dominate the world based on its technology strength. Clearly, the giant companies in electricity, chemistry, biology are in large need for recruiters for fostering their development, therefore, create more social well-beings by great brains. But the native american workforce in technology field is far from sufficient. All international students who receive top education in the US could provide their insights in their fields through the best education.

Second, the local job market would not be affected through this policy. As the policy mentioned, STEM is the region to be covered, where a demanding market much bigger than local staff could provide. The extended period of OPT will continuously increase the wealth in the U.S. 

Conversely, if the opt period is too short, it will not only accumulate the scale of international brains could bring, but case unnecessary inconvenience for US companies. The reform of H-1B visa is yet improved to meet the demand of the market. Therefore, this policy would remit the conflicts in job visas and improve local well-beings.
