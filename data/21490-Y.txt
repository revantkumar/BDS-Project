Seeing so many people are voting to against it makes me feel so disappointing. I hardly think some of them don't even know what is OPT and just go against it. As an Actuary, I only state several facts why I strongly support it: 
1. As far as I know, many insurance companies hire internationals and provide immigrant support for them, why? Simply because the amount of native talents does not sufficient enough to support job market. Employers help us stay, not because they want to, for they have to. If OPT could extend to 24 months, it will be a big relief for both employers and international employees, for they now can focus on work and unleash their potentials, rather than worrying about identification issues.

2. Now for actuarial program, why so many international graduates every year? Simply because US natives would not join the program. Internationals fill gaps and pay higher tuition, comparing to locals; so they truly support universities finance and bring competition/vibration into campus, not to mention the prestigious reputation they spread out around the globe; hence, extend OPT, or at least, keep OPT as it was, for STEM students, is a great bonus to attract international students.

3. With more high quality immigrants, they can help US to boost Economy again, example, we are expanding US dollars everyday, for shopping, traveling, paying rent, purchasing cars, etc. Where does every penny would go? Eventually, it flows into financial system and government's tax, and goes back to US families' accounts.

That's all I want to say.
