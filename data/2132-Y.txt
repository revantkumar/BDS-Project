I strongly agree with this proposal.

America is a free country. Everyone in this country, either citizen or noncitizen, should be treated equally. The STEM degrees are foundmental for building a great country and talented foreigners will help to build one.

Competition should be fair between native citizens and foreign students. This will help and encourage native citizens as well. Native citizens and foreign students learn from each other and this is what a great country needs.

In summary, this proposal is good for the country.
