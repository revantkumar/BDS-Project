George Francom Stop pushing this agenda when our colleges are overflowing with students looking for a career when they are finished. Why not make it easier for the citizens of this country to fill these positions and stop pushing the agenda's to fill these jobs with immigrants? Why is this even being considered?? As a taxpayer I am certainly against any part of this. Lets do the right thing for the citizens of this country!
