The reason for the OPT extension is there is limited number of working visa (H1B) every year. And the process of getting working visa is lottery. That means as an foreigner, even if you are outstanding in your field, and you find a great job right away after graduate, It is still not a certain that you can work in US. So this extension give these talents a second chance to get working visa.

If we still keep this strict policy on working visa, we really really need to have OPT extension to gather talents from all over the world. Otherwise, these talents will go to our competitor. Then US company will face more extensive competition globally.
