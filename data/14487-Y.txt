Strongly support the new 24 months OPT extension for STEM students!! 

I'm a data analyst and work with some STEM students, they are smart, efficient and friendly. Actually, they contribute their intelligence and effort to our nation in many fields. The prosperity of these STEM fields make United States more competitive.

Just look at those developed country with closed immigration policy, such as Japan, UK, France, their economy are slowing down, and one of the reason that our economy is stronger than those doddering countries is the large number of international talents! Further more, they make our country more diversified and attractive. United States is a great model of the world, hence she should embrace all the talents from the world!

When talking about the jobs, I would say that some our residents who disagree the new policy should improve your own capacity and competitiveness instead of blame your unemployment condition to those international talents. Most of your misfortune comes from your own, but not others. If we work and study harder, I don't we would loss our jobs.
