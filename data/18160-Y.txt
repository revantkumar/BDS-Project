Dear Chief Westerlund,

I strongly support the USICE Proposed Rule, Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students, published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2015.

I am an international student, who is pursuing a STEM degree and will graduate this December with a Ph.D. degree on materials science and engineering. The benefits of STEM extension is at least but not limit to three folds. First, the availability of STEM extension will allow highly educated international students to integrate the cutting-edge knowledge and theory learned at school into a real world applications. STEM students can gain valuable applied experience. The additional OPT time will provide us more broad exposure to industries and research institutes to accomplish challenging projects, which will aid in personal career path development. Second, because of personal career benefit accompanied by the STEM extension, graduate schools in U.S. schools are more attractive to international students and then GDP contributed from education incomes can increase a lot. Third, STEM extension is beneficial for U.S. companies, particularly for high-tech companies. A large fraction of graduate students in U.S. are international students who are outstanding in their home countries. Providing additional OPT time to STEM graduate students will assist U.S. companies to retain international talents and thus keep employees diverse, which is crucial for U.S. companies to develop new products and techniques and carry out the global strategies. Therefore, U.S. companies can exert a long lasting impact in the competitive global market. In turn, this can also boost U.S. economy. 

With the above-mentioned comments, I truly hope this proposed rule will be passed and STEM students can have up to 36 months OPT soon.
