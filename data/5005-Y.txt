Zhichong Li I will definitely support this new OPT extension rule!!
I am an international student, and also with STEM majore. The 24 months OPT extension is not only good for us to get more oppotunities of practicing in the industry fields, but also good for American companies even the whole society.
As we all know, a lot of us high tech companies are hiring international students not only because of we are good at these areas but also they need more stuffs from overseas who know different cultures could help to expand their bussiness around the global. And thses programms/projects are usually lastiing for several years, with the paticipating of international stuffs who have strong backgrounds, these companies could build giant success, just like apple, uber, google, facebook...
If the extension of OPT will be determinated, that's a huge impact to the whole IT industry.
