As an international student, I strongly support the new rule. After working so hard to come here and adopt into the system I feel like I should be given a better chance to secure a job.

I don't think I am using opportunities which should be given to Americans, because all my American classmates can find jobs which give even better compensation and benefits than any I can find, plus they don't need to worry about sponsorship and work visas. 

My grades and work ethic prove I deserve a better chance. At the end of the day, what is more important to one. That an American or a non-American made a bridge, or a person who had a 4.0 GPA versus a person with a 3.0 GPA made a bridge. Or anything for that matter. We give so much to this marvelous nation, that boasts about how anyone and everyone is welcome to come and prosper! We deserve to get this opportunity!
