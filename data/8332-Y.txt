I'm a fresh graduate from Carnegie Mellon University and I just started to work this July. It shocked me when the news of early proposed cancellation of 'STEM' extension came out. I'm here to work with local Americans to expend the software industry so that more people either Americans or international students can join us in this industry. We are not stealing the job opportunities of local people because they always have more priorities over us to find a good job. We are doing the job which most Americans do not want to do but is crucial to the country's technology, economy, education, and society. Extending the 'STEM' can help local company to reserve more intelligent young people and make a big difference to the country.
