Susana,one of the best performing colleague in my company(one of the big four), has left the US last month. It was only because she wasn't elected for H1B visa to work in the US. She loves New York City. She loves the US.It's a painful loss of my company, and loss to USA that we cannot let outstanding STEM graduates to stay and work for the country they love.

Please consider passing this regulation. Let more contributors stay.
