Hi 

My name is Dongyu Li and I have graduated in May this year. Because I am very keen on Computer Science, I would like to learn more about it in USA and then back to home. If United States can give me the opportunity, not only you can benefit from me but also I can benefit from USA. This is a very good win-win situation. Besides, there are lots of high level professors came from all over the world, they can also benefit from this and try to contribute themselves to USA. Some of them can also afford job opportunities for USA people. This can highly solve the work problems for many of American people.
