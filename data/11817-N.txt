Gentlemen: Please don't allow foreigners to take any more American jobs. There are over 90 million Americans out of work and a high percentage of American kids who have worked hard to get through college and pay for it need these scarce jobs. There are over 100,000 American military members also being laid off from military service who will need jobs. All these Americans need to be supported by their government that they and their families have been paying for. They can't go to another country to get a job and these foreigners should not be allowed to be hired in front of them with your department giving US companies incentives to hire them. Americans are getting fed up with being stolen from and abused like this.
