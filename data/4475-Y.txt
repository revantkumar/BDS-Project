Elizabeth Duarte I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

Firstly, it will attract more potential international student to choose study abroad in USA which provides a great deal of income for university and related industries. And OPT is NOT equal with the general immigration problem. OPT is very restrictive - only to international students with advance degree in a US institution. It is not even immigration. It is funny that our country allows a lot of illegal immigrants to come for free but does not give qualified students who create value for the United States to stay. International students help us built this great nation.
