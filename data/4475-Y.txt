I highly recommend opt extend to 24 months and I'm not even think about it on my position. Will, imagine it what if you have an employee that could do 2 men's job and have way more efficiency than your local people. Since our broken immigration system. Your local business man have to give up those great employees. All because of some paper work which you, government could change it now. World economy is a whole system, America wanna still standing on the top of the other countries? You gotta have some change, like President Obama said "America is and will always be an immigration country." But you guys don't want people who will make America better stayin here but some refugees? Stop fooling yourself. Have some capability to accept others, and that's how you become the best.
