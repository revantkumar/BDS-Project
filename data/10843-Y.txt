I strongly support this proposed rule since this is good for both US and us international students who attained or is going to attain STEM degree in US. As a student who is going to attain OPT. I have already worked for a company in Minnesota as an intern for almost 5 months, I had a really great time working there, and they all want me to go back after I graduate.

I sincerely think this won't cause American people to lost their jobs, I mean, after you already meet all the job requirements and doing well in the interview section, the HR wont reject you just because you are not a foreigner.

We are all human beings living on this earth, and we all only have 24 hours per day, the only reason that some people can win in the job competitions is because these people are willing to spend more time to improve their own skills, has nothing to do with their races or immigration status.
