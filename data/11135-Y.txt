I strongly support the proposal of amending the F-1 non-immigrant student visa regulations on optional practical training for students with degrees in science,technology,engineering, mathematics(STEM)from U.S institutions of higher education.

First of all, U.S citizens are facing the challenges to fill all the STEM related positions by themselves. It would benefit not only STEM students but also U.S enterprise if the new regulation is approved,comparing with the unnecessary hiring and training cost for new hires year after year due to the F-1 students have to leave in for visa reasons.

Since 2008 started STEM OPT extension, many industries like Computer Science have been growing smoothly. Thanks to the OPT extension, employers could hire enough talent international students and have long time to sponsor H1B visa for them. Longer legal working period and more opportunity to apply for H1B visa produced result of less employee turnover. Since more STEM students can stay in the US, companies can easily find their desired empployees in such a various market of talent. Only when companies do their business well that U.S can have lower unemployment rate and lead better lives.

In addition to that, foreign students have great contribution for the renting market,restaurants,entertainment industries of almost all major cities. This great potential of consuming would definitely do good to the economy especially when US economy is in the essential phase of recovery.

Therefore, in general, I support the new STEM extension proposal based on all reasons above.
