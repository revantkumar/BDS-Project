Pls clear the Already existing green card backlog for the Stem grads . The waiting time for India and China is nearly 10 years . Kindly help fix clearing the backlog first . If we get H1 and find a sponsor for our green cards and file it and India China EB2 queue the wait time is too much . Plx concentrate on doing that and that will help us more once we move to H1b . Thanks.
