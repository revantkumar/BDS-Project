One of the most important reason that U.S. can keep its leadership in the world is that it is continuously attracting talented people from all over the world. In each year, a lot of students come to US to receive high quality education and training, and OPT provides them with the opportunity to apply their knowledge and skill to contribute to the growth of this country. I strongly support STEM OPT extension with the following reasons:
1. A STEM degree or advanced STEM degree holder has the skill set and ability to contribute to our economy. 

2. An important portion of STEM graduates are PhDs and masters, who usually receive scholarships/fellowships from the U.S. government, e.g., NSF, NIH, etc. It does not make sense spend funding and resources to train those highly specialized scientists/engineers and then just let them go away. 

3. Among the overall immigrant population, the number of legal STEM degree immigrants is very small, while their skills are highly demanded.
