Ni Zhang First of all, the america is an immigration country, and who made the USA to be the most powerful country in the world? They are talented people from all over the world!!!!. not just american born scientists. 
So, I think the aim of this plan is to attract more talented skilled people from all over the world to pursue their dream, and america is one of the ideal place for them to realize their dreams. 
So I strongly recommend that we need this plan, also, american need this plan to develop their country. 
As we can see, the stem workers has done great contributions to USA, and in the future, with the fast development of the high-tech companies, more and more talents are needed. 
If the american do not give the chance to the people from all over the world. It will definitely lose a lot of technology power.
Overall, this plan is important for the US society, and it will definitely help the US to become stronger.
