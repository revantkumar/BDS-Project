I strongly propose that the STEM OPT extension should be implemented. 
International student in STEM fields have made a great contribution to the continuous development of U.S. economy and technology. This group of students can greatly facilitate the U.S. development. American higher education has invested a lot in educating international STEM students. Letting them to work in the U.S. for several years after graduation will certainly reward the American society. Pushing them out of the U.S. means that America has been cultivating talents for other countries. Only keeping these students to work for the U.S. can maintain U.S. competitive position in the world.
