In the area of STEM, every year there is a huge growth need for newly graduates in the US. According to the United States Department of Commerce Economics & Statistics Administration, STEM occupations are projected to grow by 17.0 percent from 2008 to 2018, compared to 9.8 percent growth for non-STEM occupations. (http://www.esa.doc.gov/reports/stem-good-jobs-now-and-future). STEM workers play a key role in the sustained growth and stability of the U.S. economy, and are a critical component to helping the U.S. win the future. OPT extension provides the opportunities for international students to fill the gaps of the emerged jobs and thus has a huge positive impact on the US economy.
