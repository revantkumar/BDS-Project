This is definitely an reasonable and nice new rules for those who hold F-1 Visa, and here are some of my thoughts.

These students, not only contribute a large amount of economy benefits for the United States' education institutions but also landlords around the schools, some of them even buy cars in the us, these benefits did help US create more jobs and stabilize the economy.

But, there are some reasons why these students are willing visiting the US instead of other countries in the world. 1) The institutions in the US most are in the top list, of course. 2) The US market could potentially provide jobs/interns for these students to practice what they've learned from the schools. If we don't pass this regulation, these opportunities will be limited and other countries may will take these talent from the US.

Meanwhile, lots of OPT holders nowadays are willing to start their business, this will create more jobs and even better, investment from student's home country.

And here are what we need to be careful, 1) Make sure these students are get paid based on the market demands, so they won't make other US workers jobless. 2) Make more rules to encourage them to start their own businesses easier, so they could bring more investment and innovation into the US. 3) Trying to retain these high end talent with advanced degrees or innovated inventions, make sure they could get green card or H1b easily, this will make sure the US leading position in the world, and hence, limit the possibility that some ineligible workers/companies hire those cheap labor from other country to take the job from the US worker.
