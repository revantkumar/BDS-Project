I strongly support the proposal!

First, international STEM students have been making a huge contribution to the development of the science and technology in the U.S. and they could be a very important source for IT companies in the U.S..

Second, the U.S. need diversity, which will surely bring a lot benefits to the U.S. society. In fact, diversity makes a country like a real strong country in the world.

Third, international students are actually working for the U.S.. If they have to move back to their countries, it must be a severe loss for the U.S..
