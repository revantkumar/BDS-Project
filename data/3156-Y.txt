I've seen a lot of people who opposed this proposal are saying that international workers are illegal and hurt Amecian benefits. This is too mean and so not ture. If there is no STEM international workers, high-tech will burden a hugh labor shortage and have to pay more money to product the same products like Iphones. Besides, lots of internationals do invest in the US. Their money triggered US economy.
