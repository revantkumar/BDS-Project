I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..

2. We can see there are a considerable number of professors in the US universities and most of the Chinese students have extraordinary grades. The hard working of Chinese students have improve the american academic environment a lot. They have create a lot of new things, which can be reflected by the increasing number of patents and scientific publications. Most of them gain these achievement as a students in US universities.

3. The international students do not occupy too much of the position which originally belongs to americans since most of the jobs existing in the job market is only open to americans. The US companies already have some solutions to deal with international students.
