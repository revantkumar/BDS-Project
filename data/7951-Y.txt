I am a F1 student and I really need extension to get H1b visa.

As president Obama said, the uncooperation of Congress made the US immigration law still be broken. The extension of OPT is the only hope now to stay in this country.

BTW, now it is easier for those illegal immigrants to stay in US, than us hard-studying and working foreign student, this is unfair.
