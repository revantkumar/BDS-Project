I do support the regulation. I hope we can keep them As a technical worker. I really like the international people in our team. They are really smart and brings a lot of diversity and ideas to us. I cannot believe if what will happen to the future of US if we are refusing the international people. Every people knows Instagram, whose founder is brazilian. How can we force this kind of talent to leave us. So I do wish we could keep them.
