I support this rule. 
It helps F-1 Students to stay longer and more students are willing to come to US. 

For technology companies, it is very hard to find qualified engineers. Companies do need more promising candidates including F-1 students.
For universities, F-1 students played a role of paying so that all parties like universities, local business and US students get benefits directly or indirectly. 
F-1 students also played important roles in diversity, which is critical to the success of universities and companies. 

In all, I think expanding training opportunities for F-1 Students will benefit technology companies and universities directly, and benefit most US students indirectly.
