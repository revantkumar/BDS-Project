I am a F-1 holder who has been concerning about this. Expanding the OPT length as I see could give me more time and thus knowledge about the U.S. and the STEM-related corps conditions. This would be an excellent chance for me to enhance myself. What is more, American companies are benefiting from OPT interns due to economic reason and vital spirits the interns bring. For the reasons above I back up this extension.
