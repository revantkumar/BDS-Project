I believe extension of OPT period is a good thing not only for students, but also for American's economy. Some people worry about the competition in the job market. But this is a healthy competition and will benefit the overall economy. For students they will have more time to gain work experience and enhance their productivity. For employers they will spend less resources to manage the short-term job transitions and focus more on finding suitable and good candidates for the projects.
