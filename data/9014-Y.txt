Rui Yang I strongly support the proposal of expanding training opportunities for F-1 non-immigrant students for the following reasons:

1. By extending OPT, the International students who receive higher education from the US colleges and institutes will have more opportunities to bring positive impact to the companies in the US and thus make contributions the US economy.

2. We shouldn't ignore the fact that statistics shows that US has more STEM jobs than the total number of STEM degree holders who are US citizens or permanent residents. Undoubtedly, international students specialized in STEM are not stealing jobs from US citizens, on the contrary, they are filling the increasing demand for STEM talents! Therefore, extending OPT is a win-win situation for both US economy and International students. If the gap between US STEM jobs and US STEM graduates is not filled, can US still be world leader in the future? 

3. Last but not least, let's not forget that International students working in the are also paying tax and consuming! Our social security system needs the fund to support from our tax-payers and the longer International students are allowed to work here, the longer they are contributing our tax system!
