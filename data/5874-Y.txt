monica liang I am Chinese student studying in dental school here, and I am really worried if I cannot get a job after graduation. If the tuition and all of the effort I have paid to get better education couldn't offer me a stable career, why would I bother to spent years in US and get nothing? And this opt extention is not only for a single person or a country, it's for all of the international students and also for the dreams we are pursuing and fighting for. I don't think there is any place like here where allow everyone to have their own dream and achieve it freedomly,so please give us a chance to finish our dreams and gain what we deserve to have. I will be so appreciate for that.
