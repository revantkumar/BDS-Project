I strongly support this new OPT extension rule.
International students not only play an important role in high-technology companies but also make lots of contributions to the development of the USA. Firstly, they pay much more tuition than our American classmates. So universities could put more money into their research fund, scholarship, the constructions of campus buildings and hiring professors enjoying great reputations, which could promote the education development. Secondly, it is very obvious that international students contribute a significant amount of money into the U.S. economy. Every time they go to supermarket to purchase, go to restaurant to eat, go to places of interest like New York, Chicago and California to travel in their holiday, or go to buy luxury cars, they are promoting economic development and paying wages for employees from all kinds of companies. Therefore, the new OPT and increasing number of international students do not lead to the rise of unemployment rate of Americans. Instead, without international students, there will definitely be a huge disaster to the USA.
