I am hopeful of this decision to get approved.

First of all for the United Government, This is a good initiative. United States prides itself for being the most diverse country, people of different origins are welcome. This rule will help F-1 students that form the majority of the US education system. I completely support this decision of expanding the OPT extension to 24 months. This will help F-1 students to get some training after graduating in their STEM fields. 

Hence, I am hopeful of this decision to get approved.
