I believe this is a decisive rule for hi-skilled immigrants to continue to stay in United States and server for this country. Think about why these people choose to stay here instead of going elsewhere. The reason is that they love this country as much as the Americans do. Reviewing the past, foreign graduates have brought their wisdom and dedication to various industries to this country including IT, biotechnology, and material technology, the domains that Americans are proud of. So why not approve this rule and make American the best country at present and in the future?
