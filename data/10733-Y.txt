Wake up, Americans! This is a great news for the economic growth for U.S.

Dr. David Card, the professor at University of California, Berkeley, Dr, Francisco L. Rivera-Batiz, professor from Columbia University in the City of New York, etc, all did a great amount of research on immigrants' effects on U.S. economic development. I listed the research in the end of my comments. 

First of all, the STEM field is high-skilled, and large amount of research show that the U.S. DOMESTIC LABOR MARKET is INSUFFICIENT SUPPLY. You can even think of your own experience. How many of your American classmates or friends are actually studying a STEM program? Computer Science?Research show that the second most popular major for foreign students is engineering. Among the top 25 universities that maintain the most foreign students, four are Ivy League Universities (Columbia University in the City of New York, Harvard University, Cornell University, University of Pennsylvanian), and 11 are ranking within the top 50 universities according to the U.S. News National Universities Rankings. It can be inferred that most of the foreign students receive high quality education when they are studying in the U.S. Lots of high-educated foreign students can provide enough supply for the labor force market in STEM field.

Second, research show that FOREIGN STUDENTS CREATE JOBS FOR AMERICANS! The research of Dr, Francisco L. Rivera-Batiz, who completed his Ph.D in Massachusetts Institute of Technology, When foreign students provide enough labor force support for the companies in the U.S., profitability and rate of return to capital will rise in labor-intensive sectors of that region or economy, inducing capital to move to those sectors. This RAISES THE DEMAND FOR LABOR, WHICH WILL PUSH WAGES UP AND WILL ALSO RAISE THE EMPLOYMENT OF NATIVES. 

Third, foreign students' working status HAS CLEARLY LITTLE EFFECT IN THE WAGES.
