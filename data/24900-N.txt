The American taxpayers such as myself are vehemently and strongly opposed to this government overreach program. Presidents George Herbert Walker Bush, George W Bush and Barack Obama should be ashamed of themselves for expanding such a program for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees and CapGap relief for all eligible F-1 students. This will simply take more jobs away from American workers. Then the taxpayers pay the bill for the social security and medical benefits for all the 500,000 eligible F-1 nonimmigrant foreign students. This is both a travesty and an outrage to American workers. The employers then make out like bandits by hiring the students at lower wages with no benefits. The current Obama administration really knows how to pick the pockets of the American working man and woman. This executive lead action need to be shut down permanently. I want you to fully understand that I am completely opposed to this overreach.
