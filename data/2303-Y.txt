This is exciting news! This rule will benefit financially and benefit a lot of students. However, there are a lot of people whose 17-month extension ends very close to the Feb 13th date when the final rule is likely to be implemented. It would be great if changes can be made to the rule to allow those in 60-day grace period to also apply. This would prevent a lot students from leaving the country and would receive another chance to apply for H1b.
