I don't understand why so many Americans are against the immigration policy. Isn't the United States built by immigrants? 
I don't know why so many Americans are afraid of competition. Isn't the competition ingrained in American culture?
I can't believe the country created by adventurers and pioneers now becomes the home of a bunch of "Lazy, Improvident People".
