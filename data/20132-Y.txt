I welcome this rule. According to McKinsey's report, "the United States alone could face a shortage of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills as well as 1.5 million managers and analysts with the know-how to use the analysis of big data to make effective decisions," by 2018. I do not know if our high tech companies can still survive this talent shortage and still can keep its advantage to other countries? I highly doubt that. It only costs $14,645 on average to hire a software engineer in Russia, $11,080 in Brazil, $7,333 in China. It will cost $54,980 to hire a software engineer here in the States. Chances are big IT companies have to shut down many promising projects and let foreign IT companies take the new market, simply because they cannot find talented high skilled engineers. Who is the winner? Not American people, not big IT companies. Probably those high tech companies in India, China, Europe.
