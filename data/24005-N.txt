I would like to oppose STEM expansion. I would like to propose this situation not for foreign students, but Americans in high school and above. Even older Americans and students 5hat haven't graduated yet. 1uit giving America away. We would work , " menial" jobs if given a chance and borders were closed. Thank you.
