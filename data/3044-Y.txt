I strongly support this proposal, because it is beneficial to both industry and higher education in America.

First, the extension of OPT provides more opportunities for international students to work in and contribute their knowledge and labor to United States. With more fresh blood every year, U.S. will have better chance to maintain its leading position in science, technology, and engineering in the world.

Second, higher education will be more appealing to students around the world, as the approval of this proposal will illustrate an open and diverse United States. Colleges and universities can attract more excellent potential students, and in turn increase their own education quality and campus charisma. Improved higher education will certainly benefit domestic students, and eventually every American citizen.
