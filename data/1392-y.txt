Dalin Wang I fully support this rule! This is a very good initiative to strengthen the training program for F1 students studying in US, and it certainly benefits US economy in the many ways. First, the stem students are well-trained by US high education and is a reliable workforce who can fill in the stem jobs that US companies need. Second, many stem students graduate and start their own business in the US, thus creating US jobs and push US economy forward. Third, this initiative will draw more foreign students to study in the US. According to a report, "the 886,052 international students and their families at universities and colleges across the country supported 340,000 jobs and contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy during the 2013-2014 academic year, according to 2014 NAFSA findings. This is a 8.5% increase in job support and creation, and a nearly 12% increase in dollars contributed to the economy from the previous academic year."
