Thomas Malcom Citizens of the USA should be given priority over legal and illegal immigrants. 
With so many American citizens unemployed or under employed we should not 
be bringing more workers into the country to do the limited number of jobs. 
If we need smarter workers Citizens, not immigrants, should be trained and 
required to complete the training so funds aren't wasted attempting to make them 
employable.
Those here illegally should be sent back to their homeland like Ike did after 
WW2 so American's will have jobs. The current immigration laws should have 
been enforced before and should be enforced now.
