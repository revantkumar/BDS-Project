I strongly agree with this proposal. Try thinking about how America thrived. It was gathering the elites all over the world and the combination of their wits that made America develop so rapidly. The expansion on OPT can definitely facilitate its further development as it did previously. The working condition of American workers can also be improved if more elites from all around the world come and make America a better place to work and live.
