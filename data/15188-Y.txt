The proposed rule is a much needed regulation for graduates with STEM degrees. International students with STEM degrees have proven to be of great use not only to the organizations but to the United States of America. Foreign students with STEM degrees contribute in many ways apart from the usual contributions to the universities and corporations they are affiliated with. To name a couple of them:

1. Local economies: In the Silicon Valley, the number of STEM degree holders of foreign origin is high. A lot of international students come to the Bay Area after the completion of their degree. They are generally young and spend big. That obviously leads to a flourishing economy. 

2. Tourism: Being an international student, the United States is a place to explore. Most international students use the time they are here to tour the United States. Their contributions to the tourism in this country is, therefore, noteworthy.

It is a misconception that most international students are funded by the US taxpayers. Contrary to popular belief, most international students are here to pursue a Master's degree and they fund themselves. In a sense, the exorbitant, out-of-state tuition paid by them is keeping up a lot of universities and paying for the research those universities are doing.

The United States has built itself and placed itself at the top of the world by welcoming the best talent in the world apart from using its own. That's what makes it more advanced than other countries in the world. This rule helps retain that talent for longer. 

I only hope that shortsightedness will be ignored and this rule will be passed so that, in the long run, we can give to this country as it has given to us.
