Haibin Zhang I fully support the new OPT extension proposal. This will not only benefit international students, but also USA in a variety of areas. First, it will improve the competitive strength for high-tech companies. It gave opportunities for those who have specialities but are impacted by H1B lottery. 
Second, it will strengthen US education, continuing attracting talented students to study in the country's most great universities. Third, US now indeed lacks students whose majors are STEM. OPT extension will largely fill the gap.
