Being a STEM student, I strongly believe that this rule should exist and be extended to 24 months. People from all over the world come here to be a part of the top notch educational institutes and most them have a huge burden of education loans. The students should be given enough time to repay the loans before they are supposed to go back to their home country. And with increasing tuition fee across the US I believe 24 months of STEM Extension is appropriate. 
This rule will be beneficial for the schools; it will attract international students as more students would want to take benefit of this rule which would contribute to the development of the institutes as well.

In this time of thriving US industries, there is a dire need of young minds who have gained sufficient knowledge under the US education system. This rule would not only help the STEM students and the educational institutes but will support US economy and Industrial advancement.
