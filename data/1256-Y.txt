Awesome! This is also very very important for America because for those who want to use OPT to achieve more academic or professional depth are the smartest and most outstanding people. These guys are more likely to push the whole society to move on. These guys are more likely to help America to realize American dreams. Try to think about it, they are the most outstanding people in their country so that they can come to USA! Just only for me personally, I can get a lot of extra career experiences after graduation! And I think it is also very important for other students! Therefore, it is very obvious! It is a extraordinarily excellent and brilliant proposal!!!
