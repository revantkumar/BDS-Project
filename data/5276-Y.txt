I strongly support improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. Because it will bring about a win-win situation for the country and students themselves.

For the country, it has become obvious these days that international employees are playing important parts in STEM positions, even with restricted job-searching time. This means that the companies are seeking for international employees and there has to be a reason for it. Opening up more training opportunities will help more companies benefit from hiring international employees and help boosting economy of the country.

For students, they simply did not pay such expensive tuition to just get half of education, without proper training opportunities.
