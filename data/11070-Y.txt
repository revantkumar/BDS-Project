I am a Chinese student who is studying in IIT. 
I thought in US, everyone who chase their dreams will be success one day. My major is mathematics. For my major, it's hard to find a job. But I believe if I put effort in my studying I will be success one day. So I thought this policy is good for everyone even American students because they will put more efforts.
