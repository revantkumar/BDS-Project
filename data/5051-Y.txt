Dear DHS,
I'm a student currently in the OPT period and I'd like to thank you for modifying the existing STEM OPT rule and making it more student and employer friendly. However, I'd like to bring a couple of existing issues which have not been handled in the new rule and would request you to consider them as well while drafting the final rule.

1) A student whose 17 month or 24 month STEM period ends before April of any calendar year still does NOT benefit by the current extension or cap-gap clause because, H1-Bs are filed only after April and this extension still doesn't increase the number of chances a student gets to apply for an H1- B.
2) Most employers who hire STEM students are in favour of sponsoring H1-B visas to them but the quota for H1-Bs(for international students who study in USA) is still very low at 20,000 per year and that is where the real issue is: Students who fail to get picked in H1-B lottery enroll in a college again and spend money on additional degrees although unintended. So, requesting you to solve this issue by either increasing the H1-B count in THIS category or MODIFY the cap-gap rule so as to increase the number of chances a student could use to file for H1-B.

I hope that the issues I mentioned are addressed in the final rule for STEM OPT.

Thanks & Regards,
Anish Gupta
