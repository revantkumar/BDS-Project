I totally support this policy. Some people against this policy since they want to increase the priority of American students for looking for jobs, especially in the technical area. However, as a computer science student who is looking for the job in this year, I found for many big companies, they would like to reduce the number of positions instead of hiring some low-quality people. So reducing the length of OPT cannot give high priority of American students, it only wastes the companies time and money to help the other country to train people.
