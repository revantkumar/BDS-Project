Who will benefit from the High-tech industry? Are they only who are employed by the High-tech companies? Of course not. 

I have no idea what the people who are against STEM-OPT extension are thinking about? If they are tired of living in a developed country and thinking modern is boring. I suggest them just to leave the country and immigrate to those third-world countries. What the economy of the US relies on are those high-tech companies like Intel, GE, Dow and etc., and OPT extension could enable more STEM students work in those companies, which, as a result, letting those companies making more $$$. Where will all the money of a US company make go? It will finally go back to the society, making it a better place to live!

If you want those workers go back to their countries to support their home-country companies and make US high-tech companies bankrupted, go ahead to vote against the OPT 24 month extension.
