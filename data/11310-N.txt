To whom it may concern:

My questions are did anyone really conceder the USA citizens when coming up with this idea?

Are you aware the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the
Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire
foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent
to 7.65% of the employee's pay?

So now after 6 years of college with a masters degree my grandson is going to be required to
compete against foreign students that have this advantage.

Please do not forget a foreign student just stab 4 USA students before he was shoot to death.

So I do not believe no one in the different branches of government gave very much thought about this
except the companies and their lobbyist sure did and you all are allowing this to happen. How sad.

Sincerely,
