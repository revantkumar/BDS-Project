Michael Wallace International students bring money, skills and jobs in USA. A recent study from Duke University shows that American students who actively interact with their international classmates are more likely to enhance their own self-confidence, leadership and quantitative skills. This rule is not taking away any job from us. In fact because of this rule more and more jobs are being created for American citizen with or without degree in STEM field. Economists have argued that the technology those STEM workers helped create has accounted for nearly half of the nation's economic growth in the second half of the twentieth century. If intelligent International students with STEM degrees are allow ed to work more, they would definitely contribute greatly more to the American economics as well as the technology development.
