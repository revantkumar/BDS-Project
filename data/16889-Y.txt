I strongly support this regulations with the following reasons:
1. US is a country build on advanced technologies. And Stem major students are one of the strongest power to keep US industries advanced and competitive.

2. Some people say employers will lower the salary to hire Stem students. I think that's not the case, stem students are very competitive and dedicated to their careers. So the statement of lowering the average salary in the industries is negative. The truth is, stem students help to increase the company competitiveness and raise the industry salary instead.

3. Many successful US Entrepreneurs are foreigner at the beginning. And fortunately they have the opportunities to stay in US after their study because of the OPT/STEM regulation and develop successful companies which generate many job positions.
