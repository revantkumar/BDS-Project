Kate Song I strongly support the new OPT STEM rules, which brings win-win situation for both US government and international students.

1. STEM industry, especially IT business, has always been in great demand of foreign students, who count large percent of its employees. Without STEM policy, these companies will face unimaginable disaster of loosing main work force. 

2. OPT STEM policy is a key advantage of US universities' popularity among international students when deciding where to study. Revoking STEM policy will definite lead to drop of student source. Foreign students actually benefit for university collection funding through tuition, for landlords earning money from renting house and even for local american students being driven to study harder for competence.

3. Projects and research usually take more than two years to complete, with OPT STEM, foreign student workers can stay longer for the company and create more benefit for company.

4. During STEM OPT, employers have more time to give employee a full evaluation on her or his performance, which provides employer with more flexibility in selecting out excellent foreign worker to sponsor H1B visa for.

5. I've noticed that there some negative comments complaining about STEM workers not paying tax, which is so not true! STEM worker are paying STEM tax.
