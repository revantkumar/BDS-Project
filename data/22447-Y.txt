In my opinion, the opt extension for STEM is a win-win strategy for both Americans and international students. So I strongly support this proposal. Here are a few reasons.

On one hand, the economy of the states is increasing slowly these years. And in order to support this increasing trend, it will need more and more high-quality, high-level educated people including STEM students. For example, many of my friends now work as computer engineers and electrical engineers in Silicon Valley and Bay area. They are all very smart people and willing to dedicate themselves to serving the people of the states. Besides, it helps to improve the consumption and investment inside the states. Take myself as an example. My parents and relatives come to visit me once or twice a year. During their visit, they will go to a lot shopping malls and spend thousands of dollars. And also some of them are considering to buy property in the states.

On the other hand, international students can gain more experience and contribute more to the states.
Many of my friends gain their reputation and status in their company by their efforts and talents not by low wages. Many people who are against this proposal claims that international students bring too much competition to the local students. However, this reason can't stand as long as we give a second thought. Competition always exist with or without us. And competition makes better students. The last but not the least, some of the majors are not welcomed by the local students which leads to some positions are short of people. But international students may solve this problem.

To sum up, I totally agree with this proposal. It not only benefit the international students but also, most of all, benefit the states.
