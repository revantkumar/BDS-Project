I strongly support the new proposal for the 24 month-extension 

of STEM OPT.

It is unjust and against the interest of American people to 

limit or cancel international students' legal right to work in 

US after graduation simply because they are not citizens.

International students with degrees in STEM majors contributed 

great growth to the U.S. economy. Cancelling the OPT extension 

would make U.S. lose great amount of workers and technicians 

immediately and defect the creativeness and effectiveness of the 

U.S. industry. Economic stagnates could occur and would even 

lead to worse problems such as higher unemployment rate and 

racial problems.

Also, foreign STEM students and technicians are not stealing the 

job opportunities from the citizens' pockets. Few citizens would 

choose STEM major, especially in graduate schools. However, 

companies such as Apple, Facebook and Amazon have a great need 

of technicians from these majors. International STEM students 

have just fill the discrepancy of the need and the supplement. 

Their existence and participation would also boost the U.S. 

economy, which may create more job opportunities for the 

citizens. 

At last, canceling the OPT extension would be extremely harmful 

in the aspect of maintaining the global competence. Countries 

such as Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, 

Malaysia, Taiwan, and China are actively seeking more 

international students to risen their global competence. 

International students are helping America grow, and are 

improving the welfare of American people. Losing them, on the 

other hand, will benefit our competitors and harm US interest.
