I strongly support this OPT program. 

International students make great contribution to U.S. economy. They came here to realize the American dreams. OPT program can give them more opportunities to get legal status here, to work here for longer time. If this program was failed, many brilliant students who want to work here have to go back to their home countries. In this case, U.S. will lose many talents who would make great contribution to the development of science and technology in U.S.
