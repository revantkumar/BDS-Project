The best reason for the OPT extension is that there is a growing demand in STEM fields. The number of demand for STEM major students is more than the number of students who are citizens or permanent residents. The OPT extension for STEM is beneficial to the US economy.
P.S. F1 students and H1B workers have nothing to do with illegal immigrations. :)
