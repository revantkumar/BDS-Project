I just graduated from UC Berkeley this summer and I am currently in OPT on my F1 visa. This improvement will definitely help me to have better career development in US since the employer will know the length of time that a F1 STEM student can stay in US. 

And this improvement will also attract more talented STEM international students to US for high level education.

I hope this improvement works well since it is very beneficial to my career development in the future.

Sincerely,
Weiran
