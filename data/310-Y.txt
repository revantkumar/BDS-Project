I Strongly suggest that the U.S. government pass this proposal! because those intelligent and hardworking international students will help the U.S. to remain competitive globally! Once the government cut off the period of OPT, a lot international students would be expelled from this country. The economy, which benefit from highly educated foreigners, would collapse!!!! Even Donald Trump knows this!!!!!
