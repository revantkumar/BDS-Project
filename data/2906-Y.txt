I strongly support this rule of expanding OPT to 24 months.

I can not image how the big IT companies can survive after so many foreign student leaves United Students because of the ending of their OPT. In my company, lots of engineers are still in their OPT. Why doesn't hire local people? Because even though our company prefers hiring local people, they are not qualified for those positions! How can a company hire a people who can not take care of their job?
