I have a question rather than the comment. I terminated my OPT on 2015/12 and transfer to another school and pursue the same level degree, is the new policy still applies to me? Can I continue to use my OPT because it didn't use up 36 months?
My question is based on the proposal:
"DHS notes that, under this proposal, a student seeking to obtain a second STEM OPT extension during his or her lifetime will be unable to link this extension with his or her first extension. The student would need to complete a new initial post-completion practical training period and request a new STEM extension based on a different STEM degree. DHS welcomes comments on this aspect of the proposal."
And I suggest for each degree it authorizes 36-months or even longer OPT.
