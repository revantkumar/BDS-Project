I strongly support improving and expanding training opportunities for F1 students with STEM degrees and Cap-Gap relief for all eligible F1 students. 
From cultural perspective, Americans always talk about and support diversity in this nation. As international students play a more and more important role in diversity across industry, approval of this rule will definitely help US to maintain its vision in improving diversity.
From economics perspective, international students have contributed a lot more than just in IT/CS space. Having this rule in place to keep F1 STEM students working across all industries will bound around idea from different perspectives, which will certainly boost the economic growth in US.
Therefore, I strongly support this rule.
