I support this rule for sure. 
So far, 400,000 stem students from 200,000 by 2015 (Doubling of STEM graduates). At rate of $200000.00 per student for 2 year degree with tuition and graduation fees at least, staying expenses and other education revenue the US is receiving ( Total $80000000000.00) will go other countries with OPT system. US Universities and colleges will be badly affected if the OPT Stem extension is not retained and expanded to 24 months. Most of the US Universities and colleges will shutting their doors if the OPT extension is not given because student will choose other countries for higher education. Students will contribute to the growth of US Economy by paying the Taxes on their employment ( 3 Years x $3000 per year x 400000 students= Total $ 3600000000.00). Total Benefit to US Economy Benefit in the range of $ 83600000000 for 5 years. Can you imagine what a large amount of money will be taken away from America to other countries that are using better similar policies to attract international students?
If this rule is cancelled, US economy, US companies, US government, US residents will suffer a huge loss on the mistake!
