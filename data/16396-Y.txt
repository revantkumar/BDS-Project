I support to improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM degrees and Cap-Gap relief for all eligible F-1 Students. In the long term, by giving high skilled immigrants a legal status working in U.S., this policy will boost the productivity, technological innovation, and entrepreneurship in U.S., and give U.S. the competitive advantage in the global market.
