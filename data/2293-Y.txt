The very foundation of the growth and competence of the U.S. economy has been based upon the diligence and intelligence from the immigrants. Expanding training opportunities of STEM has always been a great incentive for the US education and related industry to grow, and also a great platform for a great country like US to get access to the world's best students and scholars. If expanding training opportunities for STEM is cancelled, not only lots of future students will shift to other counties, resulting in loss of jobs for education and related industries, but also in the long term the growth of technology and education will slow down. 
In addition, I would like to see US take measures to help those young and hopeful students and people to get more opportunities to practice and grow. Thus in return, they will be the founding stones for this country to grow and prosper.
