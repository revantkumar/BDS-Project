Thanks to Homeland Security Department for working on this so hard. It's always to make such things better and clearer. I could understand most of people who are against this rule. I understand many native citizens believe they will feel more uncomfortable with competitive non-immigrate employees. But I really hope they could understand STEM program is not for all non-immigration. It's only for students with higher degree and majors in certain areas. The most important thing is to realize that these majors are the ones the U.S. needs talent employees most but has a shortage in local labor. This program actually benefits U.S. and its citizen more than any threat you believe if there could have. I believe STEM program is a good way to stimulate economic growth in IT, Technology fields for U.S., and it is also good for keeping the diversity of this country and its culture. I hope this rule can be approved.
