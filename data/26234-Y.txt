Good. Now will you pay for me to send my daughter overseas so she can get work in Australia. Oh, I forgot, they won't take anyone there, unless you already have a marketable skill, experience or college degree. 
Well? I'm waiting for a really good answer. Quit giving them the ability to come here and take all our jobs! My kid has 4 years here and not so much as a part time Burger Flipping, drink sipping job! Get Real!!!!
