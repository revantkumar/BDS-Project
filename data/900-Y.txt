I strongly support the proposal. First of all, United States is a immigrant-based country. How can people are commenting against this proposal which is beneficial for immigrants, who have the same situation as every citizen, or, any citizen's family members, who were newly moved to this new land maybe several days ago, or maybe decades ago, looking for a country of freedom? Second, the unemployment rate is extremely low, so new immigrants will not lead to large job loss rate of those who already were citizens in United States. Third, the proposal only applies to STEM students, who work hard and have good education. These people may become one of those who will impact the world and will only make United States stronger and better. If one is against this, either he or she does not want United States to be stronger and better or he or she never thinks for others because he or she can't even help those who were just like their grand parents or great grant parents.
