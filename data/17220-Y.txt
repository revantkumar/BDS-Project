OPT extension is a win-win for both US economy and international students. The H1b cap is incredibly competitive that only a portion of students can stay and work for their dream companies. For a lottery system, we don't know if there best people stay. The others would have to pack and go home if they didn't get h1b, now the extension is being cancelled. The big companies such as Google and LinkedIn need these talents. Here I am against the cancellation of opt extesion.
