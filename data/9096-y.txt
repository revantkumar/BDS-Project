Chuanwen Song I strongly support it because:
1.Stem-opt students get their job by their outstanding skills. USA is a country to give everyone equal chance. The US students should try to earn jobs by making themselves stronger, not making the competitor weaker.
2.It is good for US education and economy since it will attract more people to study and work for US.
