I think it it a really good initiative. It can help US high tech companies recruit more intelligent international students to do the job without worrying about the immigration or visa status. It's good for the economy. If the companies can maximum their profit and improve their business, why not? If a company can have a talent candidate but they give him up just because he's an international student and give that position to another guy, who is not as good as the previous one. I will say the company is not only ruining the candidate's potential but also ruining the potential of the company itself. I've always been believing that the reason why America is the best country in the world is because of it's diversity and inclusiveness. America knows how to use the resource to become stronger. The government knows what should they do and what they do is right. Have some faith. 

And honestly, if the recent graduates from college is as good as they said, they shouldn't have to worry about the employment. I'm pretty sure about that the HR knows who is a better candidate. The recent graduates have been spoiled. They need to know that if they want a good job, they have to work hard in college, instead of counting on being an american.
