Zhongzheng Shu I strongly support this OPT extension. 

Because this rule will attract increasingly number of talent international students to study in United States, which not only provides much diversity and creativity to this society but also contributes a lot to US economy. 

According to reports available through NAFSA (Association of International Educations) it has been estimated that international students and their families have contributed $26.8 Billion to the US economy and created or supported 340,000 jobs during the 2013-2014 academic year. In 2014 Massachusetts had 51,240 international students attending higher education institutions. The report calculates that international students and their families have spent a net of $1,912,915,000 in the state economy. (Please see details in this link "http://www.nafsa.org/_/File/_/eis2014/Massachusetts.pdf")

Therefore, generally, OPT extension actually did not impair the job opportunities for residents, but to a great extent improve US employment environment. I hope this rule will be passed as soon as possible, benefiting more to US economy.
