I support the new OPT extension rule. I found it is ridiculous that someone opposes this rule, because they consider that foreign workers are cheap labors. As far as I know, OPT is majorly for F-1 students who studied in U.S. for undergraduate or graduate schools. It is not for the manufacture working labors. 

Besides, the foreign workers are not jeopardizing the employment market for native workers. They are contributing to the IT industry as well as the American economy, which will further create more working opportunities for everyone.
