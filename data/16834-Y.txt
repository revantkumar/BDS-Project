Working for a start-up company and earning money much lower than average US citizen, but I really enjoy this opportunity to get closer interaction in a new environment other than my homeland. We shared opinions a lot. Working experience is quite important for both students and US society. When I was a student, study is an individual work. But when I working, I get real understanding of the country I am living, and create practical contributions in a multinational thinking way.
