This action is greate and I am strongly agree with it. United States is a country with freedom and equality. We need to bring up the same opportunities to international students since it can help them out for applying their knowledge from school into industry. Therefore, it can speed up the development of the economy, science and engineering. 

Also, the international student with STEM majors are mostly with higher degrees, such as Master, Ph.D.. However, there aren't so many Americans, may be a few, are with STEM majors with higher degrees. The development of industry and technology needs people with related majors but also higher degrees. Higher degrees mean more education, more professional, more training, more experience and more understanding into this industry. As the employer, it is good since it can reduce the cost of training and time. As a employee, he/she can get used to the working environment very quickly since he/she might work for the professor already as a research assistant or teaching assistant. More importantly, they know how to do research and bring up creative idea and make it true.

This is a good proposal and hope it can take effect.
