John Wilson International students are also helping to fill skills shortages at a time when the US share of the world's science and engineering graduates is declining. Technology is what makes America super power in the world. All the American citizens must support this rule. Many jobs are going unfilled simply for lack of people with the right skill sets. Raytheon Chairman and CEO William Swanson said at a Massachusetts' STEM Summit last fall, "Too many students and adults are training for jobs in which labor surpluses exist and demand is low, while high-demand jobs, particularly those in STEM fields, go unfilled.". Economists have argued that the technology those STEM workers helped create has accounted for nearly half of the nation's economic growth in the second half of the twentieth century.
