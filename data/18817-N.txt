I used to work at the GE plant in Erie PA. At one point, we needed to hire an engineer to develop a new engine control system. I was on the hiring team for that position. HR presented us with 6 potential candidates, ALL foreigners, all MS graduates looking for OPT or H1B. We had in house a resume from an American with all of the qualification who had relevant internship experience. When I asked why he was not in the pool of candidates, I was hushed up. 

The American candidate was not even considered for the position. OPT/H1B folks work cheaper, and will work 70+ hours per week to get their foot in the door. This is all about cheap labor, not about "best and brightest". 

During the years I worked at GE, I saw many Americans, mostly white males over 40, get let go, as many foreign workers were brought in. One of the Indian "leased employees" I worked with was working over 70 hours per week said he was paid $20k/yr. 

These foreign worker programs need to be stopped cold, not expanded. Asa former electrical engineer, I would not counsel any young person to enter any technical field because of these visa programs and the way corporations abuse them. 

Please do not expand ANY foreign worker programs, our young people need these opportunities.
