Corporate business is the ONLY source of the flat-out lie that America has a shortage of STEM workers. I have been in the field for 31 years and I have personally seen American workers replaced by cheap foreign labor over and over. Articles in the New York Times and on the ABC Evening News have recently and repeatedly shown stories on how companies are replacing their American workers with cheap foreign labor - then forcing the Americans to train their own replacements. 

Like I said, anyone who says there is a STEM labor shortage in the America is lying through their teeth, and an obvious shill for Big Business. The news proves it, the US Census data proves it, and the CEPR proves it. The May 2015 Monthly Labor Statistics provided by the US Government state there is a shortage of STEM jobs and a surplus of STEM workers.

If our own government acknowledges that there is a surplus of STEM workers, why in the Hell are we even thinking about increasing any visa allocation at all?

There are over 20 million Americans unemployed. Less than 50% of American STEM workers are employed in their own field and you want to EXPAND visa programs? That's insane! We need FEWER foreign workers taking American STEM job and STEM internships, not more. Let's get our American STEM workers back on the job! 

We should reduce the number of ALL visas allowed, especially the H1-B and L1-B visas, but also the F1 visas - their current numbers are astronomical, and are a MAJOR reason why so many America STEM workers are not employed in their chosen field.
