Every year international students contributes billion dollars to the U.S. economy. In 2013/14, the number was over 27 billion. Students from around the world who study in the United States also contribute to America's scientific and technical research and bring international perspectives into U.S. classrooms, helping prepare American undergraduates for global careers, and often lead to longer-term business relationships and economic benefits. Shortening the OPT term for STEM students will significantly effect the potential international students taking U.S as the first choice for studying aboard, while other countries, like Britain and Canada, are optimizing their policies to attract more foreign students. I believe this new regulation will benefit U.S economy in long term.
