Donald Taylor I strongly support the new OPT extension rule, which gives two extension chances (each of twelve months) for STEM students. I'm an employer in a high-tech IT company. The majority of the workers here are foreigners, and most of them are graduates from US universities. They are in the jobs such as software engineering, software/hardware system construction and design, service analysis and so on.

The most important reason that we are able to hire so many foreign workers is that we provide them a unique chance to work in our country after they have obtained their degree in US, and most important part of this chance comes from the OPT extension and H1B policy which attracts hundreds and millions foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension, these students have no choices but to come back to their own countries after they have graduated and worked in such a limited amount of time. But notice that they are equipped with advanced skills trained in US universities, which are of significant help to the industry in their own country, not US.

Take China for example, after many computer science students got trained in the US come back to China, they join the big companies such as Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent or start their own companies. Nowadays, given the benefits of so many Chinese talents, Baidu has already becomes a very challenging opponent of Google and Alibaba worths more than 200 billions and challenges the global position of our largest e-commence company Amazon. Given the low H-1B lottery rate for new foreign graduates, if OPT extension is terminated, we can not imagine the fact that a large source of talents will be lost from our country, which is definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, Amazon, which rely high of the foreign workers.
