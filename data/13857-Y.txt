I strongly support this rule. 
1. International students spend a lot to pursue their dreams in America. They ought to have more opportunities to get a job to really achieve their career goal. The H1B Visa is not easy to get. The extension will help students to earn more working experiences.
2. Diversity is very important. 
3. Competition is good for the improvement of economy. I see lots people who were opposed to this rule because they were afraid of losing their jobs. But that just means you are not good enough. Companies hire the person who have the ability to do the work perfectly.
