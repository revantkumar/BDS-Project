Many Americans graduate and have a lot of student loans. They want to work and pay back their loans,
but by having to compete with foreign workers this gets harder.

Many Americans would like to be professors but are stuck as adjuncts. Having to compete with foreign teachers 
does not help these Americans to pay their bills.

America has about 318 million people, and many people are unemployed or underemployed.
Why does the government care more about giving foreign people work than in making sure more Americans are 
working and paying taxes?
