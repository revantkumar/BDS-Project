WELCOME WHOLE HEARTEDLY this new Rule for OPT Stem Extension for 2 years ALL IN THE US WILL BE EQUALLY BENEFITED. Above every one the country and its benefit.US economy will thrive because of this new rule, because of the skill training. Culture will not get affected.

Understand that this rule not against Americans and Citizens, who are protected by this updated rule for their employment that no American should be removed from service because of this OPT and their PAY should not be reduced because of this rule as adequate measures taken.Also the new rule restricts that there is no less pay for any of the OPT students

Understand that there is a clear and well defined difference between ILLEAGAL and LEGAL immigrants/temporary workers to fill the skilled jobs and we should not create confusion about this rule on that basis as this is LEGAL OPT.

$312500000000!
