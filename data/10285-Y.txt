I actively agree with the 24-month OPT extension proposal. 

The longer OPT time would make U.S. more attractive for international students' continuing study and competitive globally in academic sectors. As an international student pursuing PhD degree in Chemistry, I choose U.S. instead of other academically more attracted countries like UK, Germany, Japan and etc. because I can have working experience with a reasonable-length period and put my knowledge and skills into practices. Without the OPT extension,I would prefer other countries with lower tuition and living cost, near my home country while providing same level, or better, education resources. 

This 24-month OPT extension will make U.S. a place for continuing study without regret.
