Ralph J Savlov It's time for our government to stop pandering to foreign students over under and unemployed American workers. We should be concentrating on developing full employment of the American workforce by supplying all Americans with the necessary tools and training to fill any and all jobs now being considered by this terrible excuse for legislation.
I oppose the DHS propose rule to expand the OPT program to the detrement of American workers and students. It's time to put America first. Foreign students attend our colleges and universities to get the best education in their chosen fields so they can improve conkditions at home. I welcome them to do so under current regulations, than go back home taking their knowledge and experience that they may have gained with them. To assure that this is accomplished, I would recommnend that F-1 visas be limited to those attending co-op education programs. This would allow them to gain the practical work experiences whike attaining their degrees.
