R.Y. Liu I don't see a point that this regulation not get approved.
I have a master degree in Electrical Engineering.
During the period I was studying to obtain my degree, U.S. citizen only take 5% of the overall students. They don't like enrolled in such kind of major, because it's tough, time consuming and requires lots of hard work during study and work in the future.
Foreign students are doing the work that Americans strongly dislike and paying tax to support benefits that can only be enjoyed by U.S. citizens and help U.S. citizens live a greater and easier life.
This is actually a regulation that will benefit U.S. citizens in the end.
