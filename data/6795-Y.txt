As an international student currently with OPT status, I STRONGLY SUPPORT this new OPT policy and I am always waiting for the FINAL APPROVAL of this GREAT POLICY!!!

1. Many so-called US citizens claimed that OPT policy would hurt Americans to get a job. This point is so ridiculous. I am an international student and I am currently work as an application engineer at a US company. During my job-hunting process and experiences, what I've learned was that there are a lot of US companies and job opportunities ONLY AVAILABLE for US citizens. They never gave me any response for my job application because I am a foreigner. As an international student in the United States, OPT POLICY GIVE US THE ONLY OPPORTUNITY AND SUPPORT TO FIND A JOB AND WORK HERE LEGALLY FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME. 
2. As an multi-ethnic immigration country, the fundamental cause to America's global success has always been its ability to attract and support the best human capital from around the world. OPT POLICY IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND EFFECTIVE METHOD TO ATTRACT ALL OF THE SMART PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD. Every year, our international students and foreign workers make great contributions to America's economic development. 
3. I am really happy to see that the new OPT policy proposed a 24-month STEM extension rule for our international students. In my opinion, this new rule would not only support us a sufficient time to improve our working skills and experiences, but also provide a huge benefits for America's economy. 

In a word, OPT policy is one of the reason why the United States is one of the greatest country in this world.
