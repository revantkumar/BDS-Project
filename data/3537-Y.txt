Faisal Raza Hi 

I wen to school in United States and now I work as an Engineer. I got my STEM extended and that was a promise made by the the USA to me that I am allowed to work until this particular date. At first I think it is not fair to take approved time away from students / workers. Plus on top of that it is a good reason for students to come here and spend money to study, one of the main reason students pick USA as there spot for high education is because of its authenticity and opportunities after graduation. Yes I believe it would be hectic for companies to track and keep all the documents required by USCIS but on other hand they are accountable on it. I think STEM extension should be approved and validated but certain check and balance process should be placed so this opportunity is not misused. This really important for students like me who's future is at stake.
