I want to comment as a response to the opinion that OPT extension program will cause Americans lose jobs.

First, the STEM students are not free to work in any field but only to those relating to their studying areas. So to the people who are arguing the STEM students will cause them lose jobs, at first make sure you are from STEM. 

Secondly, if you are really from STEM, i want to say it is fair competition, you cannot expect American government to drive away internationals to guarantee your competitiveness, which is very unwise for the whole country in the global competition environment. If America doesn't try to attract them, they will go to other countries like England, Austria, Canada, Taiwan or China. In the long-term run what is the result? The America as a country will lose its competitiveness finally. Is that what you want? You may not feel the pain instantly, but how about your children, your grandchildren? Have you think about them, can you stop being so selfish and shortsighted? Can you think about your whole country in the long-term run? Can you start working harder, build your expertise and take courage to compete with those STEM students? Stop being lazy and blame the government rules!

Also, there is always a great need in STEM field. I worked in Software Quality Assurance area in an engineering company in Indiana. My company went to Purdue University to recruit a lot.They have several F1 students working for them. My manager told me it was a great help for their projects and with the business growth they always need more people for occupancy.
