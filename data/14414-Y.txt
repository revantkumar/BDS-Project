I strongly support this new rule of OPT extension.the OPT extension will, in fact, contribute to the well-being of American citizens for the following reasons: 

I'm a Chinese STEM student and was born and living there, I would return back China eventually.before that, I 'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech industry development. 

The OPT extension rule will attract far more international students to America. Only a small portion of these students will eventually stay. Most students benefit the US economy by paying a huge amount for housing, tuition, food, service, etc and leave the US after graduation. 

Some people might believe that OPT extension will allow companies to hire international students for a lower wage which leads to a decrease of benefit and job opportunity for US citizens. However, this is completely untrue. US companies are NOT allowed to hire an international student instead of a US citizen for a lower wage. As a matter of fact, it is much harder for an international STEM student to find a job than an American STEM student. International students have cultural and communications barriers which put them at a much lower hand during interviews. Furthermore, most companies prefer American students over international students because they do not want to go through the extremely complicated and unpredictable process of H1b application. Last but most importantly, in order to sponsor an international student, the employer will have to open the job to American citizens first. Only if no suitable American candidate is found can this position be awarded to an international student.
