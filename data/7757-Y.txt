I strongly support to extending OPT. As follows I will state how the United State will benefit from this policy, taking the example of myself, a PhD in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

First, a long term OPT could give us the opportunity to make major contributions in the area we expert to.

Take me as an example. My research area is distributed system and cloud computing in computer engineering. A typical project I work on should take more than 2 years (usually 3 year if we are to build a comprehensive system), since a project included demand analysis, protocol design, lots of experiments, diagnoses and revisions, and each of them takes months, or years to accomplish. Not to mention those who work in Chemistry or Biology, the projects may last even longer.

With a short term OPT, almost no one would choose to start such a long-term work with the risk of leaving the project before thoroughly accomplishing it, even though the work was solid. Instead, one may choose a short-term project, which is safer, but imagine how much reduction in his contribution to this area, to America.

Another thing that I want to mention is the positive effect that a long-term OPT could bring to the governments budget. In my school, or at least in my department, more than half students are Chinese of Indian, i.e. international student. Each of us pays for lounging, food, transportations, and the most important thing: tuitions. For all those we spend, tax is paid to the government. 

Obviously, a long-term OPT will definitely encourage more international student to attend US universities. Thus it leads to a makeable increasing in governments budget. Plus, we all know that the tuition for an international student exceeds that of a local student by more than a little. Imagine that.

Of course, I personally will benefit a lot by a long-term OPT, since it gives me more time for hunting a job and more chance to get the green card.
