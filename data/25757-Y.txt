This rule needs to go through. I SUPPORT this.

Can u imagine the US tech industry without STEM OPT students? We are talking about whether we need to set up the length of OPT to be 17 or 24 months. However, so many comments received and posted are keep talking about the validity of OPT. I have to argue that those kind of comments are even not valid and should be taken into consideration. 

People with American dreams keep fighting for their own life. International students didn't do some illegal stuff. They pay tax, they working the same time as employee with citizenship. They contribute to the country;s economy growth. This year's unemployed rate is the lowest for the last ten years. Every year. there are people can't find proper jobs. Are u going to blame these all on STEM students? That's ridiculous.
