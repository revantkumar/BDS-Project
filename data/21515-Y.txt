I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international material science master student from China and was a material engineer intern at Global Foundries. I had many options for studying like Singapore, UK, Canada. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. BTW, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. 

I think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program. Based on my previous work experience at Global Foundries, most large research development projects would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion.

As I'm a Chinese STEM student and was born and living there, I would return back China eventually. Before then, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech industry development. If I have about 3 years work experience in US, I would be competitive in the job market of China. Then the U.S will build great reputation for their outstanding students, so Chinese companies and Chinese government will encourage Chinese talents to go to US for studying. This will bring great benefits for US government.
