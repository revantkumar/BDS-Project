The attached GAO report dated 27 February 2014 documents lax ICE oversight of the controversial OPT program. This lax oversight argues strongly against the proposed massive expansion by DHS of the OPT program, aptly described as an "end run around the H-1B Visa program annual statutory caps."

As a harmed 63-year-old American citizen with a natural science Ph.D., who has been systematically denied employment opportunities via the H-1B program (and hence, by extension, the OPT program) that he has identified as a "government-sanctioned employee preference program" in some of his published articles, I'm requesting termination of the controversial OPT program. The OPT program also contravenes the Constitutionally-mandated plenary power of Congress to regulate immigration.

I strongly urge DHS staff analysts to reject the proposed regulation because it harms the employment prospects of similarly or better-qualified American citizen technical professionals.
