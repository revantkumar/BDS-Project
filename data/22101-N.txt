Enough already - we have thousands of unemployed college graduates begging for jobs in their field. It is unconscionable that our American leaders would simply ignore the needs of our country and our people by allowing high tech jobs, or any jobs for that matter, to be offered to citizens of other countries. It's time to put AMERICA AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FIRST! While I understand our President is not up for re-election, his party certainly is. Is it too much to ask that the very people elected to hold office and serve the people of the United States actually do what they were hired to do?
