I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. We are not talking about jobs about being a taxi driver or cashiers. We are dealing with the jobs requiring expertise in scientific fields. Most of them can only be done by people getting trained in graduate school for years. International students have composed of a large percentage of phd students in US universities/ research institutes. It will greatly affect the progresses of research projects and tech companies if the proposal cannot pass.

2. Isn't it a waste of talents? US has provided such good education opportunities for the international students and just let them go and apply what they learned elsewhere?

3. There is one more thing we need to consider. If people cannot stay, why whey would spend so much money to get education here? What will happen to most of the universities with greatly reduced income?
