I DO SUPPORT this OPT Extension policy! 

As a current STEM international student, I chose US for my further study largely because of its OPT. As you can see, studying in the US is extremely expensive. I think it is valuable because I believe my work experience in the US after graduation cannot be replaced by that of other country. If I can only work for one year after graduation, it does not make much sense. If there is no OPT Extension, I will not encourage students in our country to study in the US. Do you want a lot of international students go to other developed countries rather than US? Do you want only a few STEM students to make contributions to American economy? Can you imagine the serious outcome? 

This policy is not only good for us international students, but extremely important for you and your country!
