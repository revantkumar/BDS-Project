It seems interesting to me that United State, an immigration country would not allow foreign students to work as much as possible to fulfill their 'American dreams'. When you are talking about democracy, liberty, justice and equity, while you are against the law of giving non-immigrant students the rights to work in the same way as the citizens do, it is just ironic. 

First of all, foreign students are paying a huge tuition for their education aboard than the locals, and if they can not even be guaranteed for enough time to work after graduation, please stop talking about equity all over the world. Everyone has the rights to work as long as he fits the requirement of that job. So is there any reason to differentiate students between locals and foreigners? 

Talking about tax, students in OPT are paying tax AS WELL. They just have partial of the tax waived, but that DOES NOT mean they are not paying tax to this country. They are actually contributing to this country, so they deserve the rights to stay here and work!!

Somebody is arguing that those foreign students are taking away so many jobs that it makes local students harder to get a job. I am sorry???? Come on kids, welcome to the world and it is time to grow up. Companies are looking for the RIGHT employees who have the abilities to work for them, if you can not find a job, then it is your problem. You are NOT good enough and you do not deserve a job. So do not blame that on foreign students, and even if all the foreign students are gone, you still can not find a job because you are WEAK, and that is how the world works.
