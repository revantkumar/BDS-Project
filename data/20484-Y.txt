I strongly support to expend Training Opportunities for F-1 Non-immigrant students with STEM Degrees for the following reasons.

Firstly, Comparing with one year Training Opportunities, three years' Training Opportunities benefit American company and society, since international students can make two more years contribution to company as trained employee. It is obvious that an student can not be very productive at the beginning when they join in a company,especially for some Technique position. After one year's training, they will be more familiar with their work and more productive. However, if they just have one year Training Opportunities, they have to leave company after one year. This is definitely a loss of the company and American society.

Secondly, since international students boost consumer demand and economywe have no reason to stop them coming. In the past, STEM students' have 29 months' OPT. Shorting the OPT to 12 months will definitely reduce the will of international students to come American, which will hurt American economy a lot.

Finally, I fiercely opposed the point that international students compete with American and reduce American's job opportunities. As we know, the job international student did are what American hate, such as programming and mathematics. This position are boring and tough. It is advisable to hire international students to do these positions.
