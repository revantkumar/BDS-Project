I strongly support this rule because is a win-win policy for both American and International students who are are learning STEM major in US. On one hand, STEM graduate students are required by most of US tech companies, they can bring more benefits from those international students. On the other hand, this is also a good chance to use their talents to realize themselves, and gain more experience from US.
