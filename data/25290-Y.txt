I highly agree with this extension. Any well educated and skilled students is the most valuable resource for a country, especially for an immigrant country like the USA. Many STEM related work is not as the same like other regular job, it won't reduce the employment of residents. Millions of foreigner students take their culture and skills into USA and acquire higher degree, that's a great sign for this country; and it will be much worse without the inspiration of extension, foreigners may would choose other country when study abroad.
