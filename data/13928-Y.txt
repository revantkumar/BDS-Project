The future of the U.S.A counts on the development of science and engineering. F-1 students with STEM degrees are vital workforce fueling the high-tech companies across the U.S.A. Without their contribution, we will see a huge setback in the economy growth and society development. The fragile US economy can not afford losing such precious and important talents. Improving and expanding the OPT training opportunities for them is definitely the correct thing to do. I strongly support this proposed rule.
