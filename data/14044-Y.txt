I support this regulation.
As a foreigner I understand some of the concerns US citizens have. But a few thing may not be true, as listed below:
1. I earn 80K plus and most of my foreign friends earn the same. I don't see we are cheap. unless those who a complaining have a higher standard.
2. We pay tax same as citizens but have little right as citizens. The only thing we don't pay is social security and medical care because we won't use any of that money unless we retire in this country, which I seriously doubt.
3. America is a immigrant country. If we trace back, very few of the citizens are rooted in this land. Then why should we be treated so differently.
4. We pay a tuition of 50K a year to get educated here. If a foreign student want to buy a car, the living expense would be more than 50k for two years. So for a two year degree, we pay more than 150k. Where does the money go? To America economy.
5. Foreigners have all kinds of restrictions when looking for job. I would say 80 percent of the job on the market require citizenship. If I'm a citizen, I would have much more choice. Company who hire foreigner would have to sponsor and pay more.
