I STRONGLY SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. A lots of students from top universities will be forced to leave the country, although they are willing to make contributions to the US economy after graduation. This is going to hurt the country to a great extent, considering the high education level, expertise and the number of international students who are enrolled in STEM programs.

2. Silicon valley, where a great number of STEM students are working for, will get get hurt from the 12-month OPT. A lot of current employees will leave the companies and apply their knowledge to improve and work for high tech companies outside of the US. I am sure it is not hard for them to find another job in Canada or UK. 

3. A lot of other countries have great policies to attract talents overseas. I am a permanent resident of Canada. In Canada, all students who hold a degree from Canadian universities will have 3-year work permit, which is equivalent or even better to 3-year OPT. I don't see why U.S, the most powerful in the country, would neglect the strong will of international students who have decent education background to stay and make contributions to its economy. 

4. International students do bring competitions for locals. But it is never a bad thing. No competition, no progress. A country, and a citizen of a great country, should not be afraid of competitions, which would stimulate the growth of more talents and economy.
