I strongly SUPPORT the extension proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should give opportunities for international students studying in US Universities to gain more practical experiences through diverse internships and training opportunities. Extending and improving training opportunities for us is crucial and meaningful because a longer time span would help us accumulate in-practice knowledge more in-depth and thorough, and thus be better prepared for future career. From another perspective, this extension proposal is also in accordance with our desires to make contribution to US and to make the world better place. 

2. Diversity and equity are most well-known traits for US. International students are unalienable portion of diversity which promotes positive competition, creative insights, diverse collaboration, and technology innovation. However, the current training opportunity is limiting those intelligent and creative processes to sprout out and grow up. Indeed, this extension proposal is such a beneficial chance for both our international students and US society.
