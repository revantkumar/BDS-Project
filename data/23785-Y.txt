I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Diversity is very important for the U.S., various culture backgrounds give more possibilities and chances to achieve new technologies, which will certainly benefit the economic of the U.S..

2. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Without the urgent need of light, the electric lamp could not be invented. With the certain pressure, people will work harder and as well as pay attention to improving themselves. It is not only a benefit for economics but also a good influence for advanced technology developing.

3. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..
