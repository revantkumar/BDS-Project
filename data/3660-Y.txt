I STRONGLY SUPPORT the approval of the proposal. OPT extension provides opportunity for international student to be able to legally work in the U.S. after graduation. 

It is a way to provide every single individual to realize their AMERICAN DREAM, especially for international students. After years of higher education, international students make HUGE CONTRIBUTION to this country, however, without OPT extension, it is impossible for international student to be hired by any companies because no one wants to hire someone who can only stay for a while. 

I don't think it increases the competition for US citizens. For the companies who are able to find the right US citizen to fill the position, they will definitely hire one with no doubt, because it is much easier to hire a US citizen than an international graduate (much more paper work). The OPT extension was to provide opportunities for those companies struggle with hiring US citizens to hire someone else. On the other hand, it helps international student to be able to gain working experience, which is good for their future career, no matter in the US or in any other countries. 

In sum, it's a win-win, why not APPROVE such proposal?
