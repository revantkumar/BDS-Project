Phani Chamarthy I strongly support this rule. It would be highly beneficial for current students and for future students who are planning to pursue their Higher education in the United States. I really appreciate the fact that the DHS considered expanding the OPT Extension period from 17 months to 24 months when they were requested to follow the rule making process for the existing rule. Thanks to the DHS for identifying the significance of this rule and working on this so quickly.
