SUPPORT! FULLY SUPPORT!

What I am saying is, if u guys can pass the H4 ead card for the guys with H1b visa. Why is it so hard for u to approve this STEM OPT rule? Those people get impacted by this rule are actually the guys contribute their time and what they learned to help the country. They got properly payed and pay their tax to federal government legally. Why do the citizen concern these people steal jobs from theirs? The STEM program is for highly educated people. Pls do NOT mix those jobs with the position in Burger King and McDonald.
