I feel that the OPT extension should include to to students with STEM undergrad from foreign universities because:

1. MBA + STEM background gives a unique combination of technological ingenuity with requisite management skills. This is critically important in today's rapidly changing business environment.

2. With USA being the hub of technological innovations, a MBA with a background in STEM helps the host company to bridge the cross functional technical knowledge gap. 

A USA company would definitely benefit from having a MBA with a previous knowledge of Technology/Medicine
