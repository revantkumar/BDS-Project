Danyan Li I strongly support this revised rule for F-1 students, which will facilitate the development of America economy and society greatly.
1. Expanded training period will enable F-1 students to contribute their skillsets learned from US universities to US companies for a longer time. U.S. employers like F-1 students, they deserve to have more chances and more opportunies to work in the U.S.
2. F-1 students in the job market will lead to a healthy competetion, which is beneficial for U.S. economy. Since it will attract the most talented people to the U.S. and choose the most suitable person to work in a certain area. 
3. F-1 students also will improve social diversity. In such a closely connected world, it's more than good for U.S. citizens to cooperate with foreigners and learn from each other.
