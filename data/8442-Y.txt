This is a cool policy. My son's wife learned computer engineering and they are classmates when they are in college. They have been married for 5 years and raised two children. I have to say that their education is really a mixture and performs very well. To be honest, my son doesn't perform good logic ability as his wife. However, he has a good talent in arts. I am very grateful that they balance their education very well. And they both got decent salary and lives a happy life. I think they are one in a million American family.
