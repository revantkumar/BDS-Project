I still believe employment should be based on the skill set of the candidate. I being a US Citizen for a fact know that Foreign students are far more skilled and hard working that the American Citizens. It makes sense for employers to hire Foreign Students. US is and will always be a land of Immigrants. Look back at your Grand Parents, they were giving equal rights when they first moved in to the US. I strongly believe in any rule that will help the country to move forward and I believe that this rule will help us do that.
