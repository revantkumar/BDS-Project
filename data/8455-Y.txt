I strongly support the extension OPT for STEM Degree students for the following reasons:

1. As a student with MS in Finance degree,I personally feel that it's already very difficult to get a job in finance industry for an international student. Most of the my classmates are just using STEM OPT time for internship. Without the STEM extension, it would be more difficult for international students to get proper training opportunities after graduation. It would no doubt discourage future international students to apply for U.S. universities and I believe cross-cultural discussion and brainstorm is one of the most valuable part in U.S. universities, especially in this age of globalization. 

2. While some may argue that international students are competing unfairly by charging lower compensation, the most common career for students eligible for STEM are engineers,quantitative analysts etc. These positions offer high salary and don't really fall into the "low-income, low entry barrier" type in the first place. Banks and IT companies have large demand for talent every year and good competition can help make sure the quality of the talent entering into the business. As a global pioneer for innovation, it is crucial for United States to keep up the competition and select the best talent available.
