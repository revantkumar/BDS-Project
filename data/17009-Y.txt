I absolutely SUPPORT the new proposal for 24 month-extension of STEM OPT.Here are some three main reasons : 
1. International students majoring in STEM subject who can stay longer in the USA can help development of technological and economic So we should allow those students holding F-1 visa stay longer for the sake of our country. 
2. Some people argue that those international students may create intense competition for jobs in the U.S. In fact, this is not bad in a long run. Competition can increase skills and give our companies more choices . Since our citizens have already natural edge when competing with foreigners . We should probably blame our elementary education in STEM instead of immigrants if our citizens can still find it hard to land a job in STEM field with all these advantages. If we allow tremendous amount of skill-equipped human resources outflow from the U.S only because of weak competitive power of our citizens, then it will be a huge loss to our domestic companies and to the country as a whole. 
3 Our domestic companies can send these talented employees to foreign sub-companies .These international student have more advantages than our own employees because they know more clearly in their countries about laws , treatment styles,etc. ,which can enhance competition and expend scope of business.
