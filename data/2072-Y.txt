Weisiyu Gao I strongly support this rule for several reasons, 
1. As a Public Health Student, I know there are shortages of public health and medical employees all over the America, it applies to nurses, physicians, pharmaceutical technicians, public health workers, environmental specialists, and the list goes on. We really do not take American's opportunities, but rather than serving Americans!
2. Lets see some important positions of Public Health. Who is Surgeon General of United States now? The son of immigrants from India, Vivek Murthy. It is just a example that immigrants can do well in this country, and American should give us this opportunity to work here and to serve Americans, it also gives Americans themselves a opportunity, to live in a better society. 
3. What does America need? Well educated people who can serve the country. STEM students are hard working and well educated. America does need people who just have money to invest this country, this is a short term solution, those people does not work here or get education here, they don't know the culture of this country. However, international students are different! We know this country, we know what this country needs, we know how to serve this country, we know how to do best in this country! 

For the reasons above, I STRONGLY SUPPORT expanding STEM student's OPT.
