I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. USA owes much of its wealth and strength to the vast group of excellent people who come from every where around the globe. Where there's competition, there comes the best part of people. But, international students still face much greater challenges than the natives can imagine. The language, extra tuition, limits in choosing courses to stay fully registered, a very short period of time for job hunting, and not to mention, visa problems that many companies want to avoid. With all of the difficulties, only the best minority can stay in the USA. Isn't that going to strengthen America's technology and science and view and everything? Should these excellent people still feel too much rejection, and that almost all internationals feel hostility in this country, will people still come to the USA? Perhaps not, even if they come from less developed countries, they still have a LOT of choices. I myself would have stayed in Japan if I was better in Japanese. But, they absolutely do not pose that many obstacles for internationals to find a job and work in Japan. But if the policy in the USA changes toward a direction that I feel that my life quality is threatened, I may change my mind. Please be aware that the brilliant people have choices. They can elect where they want to stay.

USA is definitely the strongest country in the world, but it might or might not stay as number 1 in the future. The way it treats the immigrants plays a very important role. Excellence in science and technology come and go with people. And people come and go according to their feelings. Don't hurt their feelings by making their life harder, as it already is.
