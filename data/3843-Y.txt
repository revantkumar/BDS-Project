I strongly support this. 

First of all, international STEM students are not competing with US people by accepting lower wage. What they are doing is cutting edge technology which is actually improving the economics.

Second, history has already proved whoever try to close their door to elites from around the world end up with regression. 

Third, openness and embrace have always been the spirit of USA, and it is, and away is, the key for this country to success. This is something that this country should never forget and lost.
