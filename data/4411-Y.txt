Anybody who can support the community, make contribution to the country should stay, no matter his/her background, what he/she does, cut grass, fix the house, deliver fast food, etc. Why we force those young, lovely, well-educated adults leave?

We need them.

US is a free world and welcome anybody with a good mind.
