With a job market in such a dire state it is becoming even harder for an AMERICAN to get and sustain gainful employment and it seems that our goverment is working against those whom they are suppose to be working for, if this passes it will lead to important jobs going to foreigners and not to the many naturally born Americans who are finding adequate employment to sustain a family hard to find! We NEED to make jobs for AMERICANS a priority and give businesses incentives to hire AMERICANS and even incentives to businesses to help further their employees education! Remember it is the American public who pay your salaries and as such they deserve better from those who we vote into office and we would expect they would do whats in the best interest of AMERICANS and do everything in there power to give us a better chance at gainfull employment instead if giving it to FOREIGNERS!
