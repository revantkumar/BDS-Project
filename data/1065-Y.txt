The extension will do good to the economics of the USA.

Take Pittsburgh as an example.

First of all, the extension will help the local Americans make more of money. For example, as more and more people has to stay in American, the real estates will be scarce. In that case, the owner of the estate can raise the rent and make more money from it. Even the oldest building will have somebody wants to live in. 

According to the data showed in the littlebighomes (http://littlebighomes.com/real-estate-pittsburgh.html), the real estate appreciation is over 80% in the last 20 years. That is undoubtedly because of the increasing number of people lives in here.

Besides, in order to favor the needs of the real estate. More and more real estates will be built and more job opportunities will be favored.

Secondly, the extension will save the local farm. Since more and more people will live in Pittsburgh, the need for vegetables will increase. In that case, local farm will sell more and more vegetables.

Lastly, the extension will improve the sales of grocery stores. According to the data given by united states department of agriculture (http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-markets-prices/retailing-wholesaling/retail-trends.aspx), Sales by the 20 largest food retailers totaled $449.3 billion in 2013, accounting for 63.8 percent of U.S. grocery store sales, an increase from 39.9 percent in 1993. As more and more people will live in America, more and more grocery will be sold, it will make a lot of profits for those who does jobs related to these: the cashier, the supplier, the farmer. Even the bus driver who drives the people to the grocery store. America will create more and more job opportunities because of the extension. 

In all, I am totally agree with it.
