Anonymous I think it is beneficial to both STEM F-1 students and U.S economy with 24 months OPT.

Here are a few reasons:
1. It will reduce the stress of H-1B.
2. It will make U.S education more attractive to foreigners comparing to other countries such as UK. 
3. It will attract more foreign talents who are specialized in STEM areas.
4. Two more years are reasonable time for new graduates to apply their knowledge to the industry and even step into different fields of interests. 

Thanks!
