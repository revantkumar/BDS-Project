I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. When applying a U.S. university, International Students told about how they can serve the U.S community after their academical work, and Training Opportunities is the EXACT and even ONLY the chances to let International students prove their promises. International students contribute a lot during their study in the US, they bring economical improvement for the whole society and culture communications. They did bring tense competition, but for US local students, this competition is positive that can make their huge improvement by sharing ideas with international students. I believe same positive effect will happen if international students go to a US company and fit into the society during OPT. US enterprises should welcome international students as long as possible to make achievements.

2. There's completely NO WORRY of international students occupying job positions! The job hunting is already TOUGH for them because we all know that enterprises will consider local students FIRSTLY, then international students.The positions international students take is mainly the LEFT POSITIONS of local students. We have to admit that International students not only fill in the job blanks that local students would not to take part in, but also bring a giant benefits for the whole US community. 

3. International Student do their best in academic study and always willing to serve the US community during their OPT, the government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S.!
