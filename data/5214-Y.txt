I support this proposed rule. As a matter of fact, F-1 students made far far great contribution to America's economic and technology. They have limited stay period in America but did far more that native cannot achieve. I'd say, if America want to still hold the NO.1 place in the world, you should make full use of F-1 students' knowledge and talents and still keep open mind and generous.
