This is a reasonable proposal and I find it great!

First of all, it's very helpful for the US to keep those high education people who could make the economics, technology and society develop much faster.

Secondly, if the OPT period is only one year, a lot of foreign students will choose other countries such as Canada, Australia etc. to get their high education diplomas and have much larger chance to find a job in those countries.This will cause a great loss of the US financial income in education field.

Thirdly, if this proposal could not be validated in time, in February 2016, there will be millions of high education people who will be driven out of the US. This should have fatal impact on the US economics and technology, especially in very developed areas like Bay Area, LA, New York etc.

Last but not least,the proposal gives the graduated students from specific majors more time to get work experience in the US. Nowadays, it is harder and harder to find a job in the US because of the high competition and high level recruits of the past several years. If every foreign student gets only one year, it will be much less chance for them to find a job and improve their practical skills. 

I really hope that this new policy will be valid before February, 2016.

Thanks!
