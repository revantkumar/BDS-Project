I wholeheartedly support this proposal.

Every year, the F-1 students are bringing enormous economical benefit to the US. Think about the largest tech companies, where most of the STEM degree F1 students work in. They contribute tons of tax money to the US gov, they brought up the economical growth to the neighborhood area, their downstream revenue stimulates the markets. All of these in turn actually creates more job opportunities in the US: more tax money, the more the gov can create jobs and help the unemployed; the more qualified workers relocate to the areas, more needs are created and more jobs will be created.
