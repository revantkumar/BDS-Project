I definitely support the extension of OPT period for F-1 STEM students. I came to U.S. in 2011, and started at an engineering program with a lot talented foreign students, among which most are at graduate level. I saw how many of those talented students got well trained and educated, but had to leave this country with still willingness to contribute only because of the visa/OPT issue. Extending the OPT period will not only reserve those people and let them contribute to the country right with what they have been educated but also show this country's welcome to diverse and talented foreigners, which is also a crucial factor to maintain U.S. sustainability.
