Han Yu, American Express Good afternoon,
This is Han, manager in Amex, Im writing this comment is to support the STEM extension policy.
As a manager in Amex, I have the opportunity to work with multiple foreign labors, their performance are undoubtedly good. Thanks to them, we solved questions that we never been able to solve, delivered products that increased our revenue by millions (based on statistical testing results), due to their contribution, my groups headcount has significantly increased during past year
Based on these experiences, I believe that cancel this policy will surely do more harm than good, it is short-sighed to turn off labors with superior skill/ability and force them back to their home country. Where there is no vision, the people perish
