As an international student now studying in the US, I feel so excited about the proposal that I believe it will both help more brilliant people and to make this country better.

Nowadays more and more international students come to the US to pursue a better education as well as a good working experience after graduation. Because of the limited training opportunities as well as the number of H1b, many students who have been doing great and are just about to make a big difference in their career cannot be lawfully staying in the US once after their OPT expiration, which would be a great loss both for them and this country.

Students in STEM are a group of people who master in frontier and advanced technologies, which is so important to a country. And people who are able to be employeed must be those with good proficiency in their field and nice character, which make them deserve the chance to stay and make more contribution to this country.

In one word, I support the proposal and believe it would bring an amazing progress to America.
