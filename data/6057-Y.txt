Delmar Jackson We have over 3 million graduates with STEM degrees either not working or not working in their field. 
There is no benefit to American workers from this program.. It is not about helping American students,
it is not about training American students.
It is entirely about helping foreign graduates who are cheaper to hire for companies. it is about helping corporations 
save on wages and pass on all the true costs to the American workers.
If a foreign graduate is truly outstanding, if they are a genius and can prove it, I think we should welcome them.
We do not need the others, the mediocre and average. We have plenty of them in Washington already.
This program will only accelerate the decline in Americans going into STEM fields
as they can plainly see the stagnant wages and fewer job opportunities which have been happening for years
and will be their future caused by massive hiring of foreign workers.
The workplace is changing dramatically and it is estimated as many as half of all jobs will have been taken
by robotics and automation and Artificial Intelligence in the next 20 years.
The government should be focused on training for it's citizens and less focus spent on obeying the open border globalists
and corporations who want to flood our country with endless waves of foreign workers 
so they may profit and then pass on all the social, economic and environmental cost to our communities.
