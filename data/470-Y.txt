I strongly support US to keep those talented and well educated international students. Our economy is built by all kinds of smart people. Technology is developed by people mostly major in STEM. If all those foreigners grew up in the US, it would cost US a lot more money to provide them with public education and all kinds of services before they could work. Now those educated foreigners are willing to stay here and build the economy for the US, which means the US "steals" those smart people from their original countries with very low prices. Also, I don't think those foreigners would take jobs away from American. There are always opportunities as long as our economy is growing. If the US turns talented foreigners away, we will have less competitive advantages compared to other countries. That is NOT the US that we all like.
