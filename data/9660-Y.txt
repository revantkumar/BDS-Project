I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:

1. It's American spirit to give everyone an equal opportunity. Talented students who came to US deserves more time to enhance their practical skills after graduation. Foreign students are potential talents in future career.

2. Longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in US and contribute their own to the American society.

3. Companies tend to hire Americans who have the same background set as OPT students. So it doesn't hurt the benefit of the domestic students.
