I am afraid that turning down STEM students will degrade the confidence of people towards to American high-tech industry, 
which has been creating huge economy contribution for the whole nations for the few decades. Loss of potential talent engineers 
or researchers will leave the country in an awkward situation. History has shown everyone ever benefited by what they have done.
It is a win-win game. In general, chasing off your partners is never a good idea.
