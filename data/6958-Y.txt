I went through a few comments which object this practice. The two main reasons people are arguing are international STEM students are taking jobs from US citizens and companies are hiring cheap foreign labors. I live in Silicon Valley, I was also an international students a few years ago. As far as I can see, in the field of technology, US is still HEAVILY depending on international work force. And I didn't see any inconsistency between foreign and citizen employees in terms of compensation. I cannot imagine how U.S. will benefits from keep away the international talents. Also, U.S. citizens are always more welcome in most of the hi-tech companies, because companies need diversity and they don't need worry about their immigration status. If there is not OPT expanding, tech companies won't fill the gap by recruiting international students. It is quite obvious how important the technology is to this country. U.S. is facing competitions from all around the world. U.S. will suffer the consequences, if this extension is not approved. Thanks.
