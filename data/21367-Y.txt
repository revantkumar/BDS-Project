I graduated from a master program in 2012 and worked under OPT and OPT STEM for 17 months after that. Luckily, I finally got selected in the H1b lottery in 2014 and I stayed in the country to fulfill my American dream. It is needless to say how important the OPT STEM program was for me as it basically changed my life path.

For every hard-working foreign student that has to go through the challenging selection process to be matriculated to a graduate school here, getting the post-graduation training is definitely necessary for him to not only gain related experience for his future career, but also better contribute to the society. 

I don't think America is a country that drives talents away because they don't have permanent residency. In fact, if there is only one country in the world that always opens his door for smart young people, it should be America. Don't forget how many young scientists came to this country during World War II. And those people brought passion and gifts to this country, creating the unprecedented post-war prosperity in the last several decades. 

The other thing we should not forget is that most graduate programs that are qualified for STEM are not job-oriented. They are mainly focused on academic side, and less practical side. So students from those program generally have a harder time finding a full-time job which supports H1b visa right after graduation. I can see why the idea of STEM was brought out in the first place and it actually makes a lot of sense to me.

Please forgive my poor English. But I do want to give all my support to this proposal, as I believe it will attract a lot more talented people all over the world to come, leading to the greater success of this country.
