I totally support STEM OPT Extension, the reasons are simple and clear:

1. If United States of American is still planning to be the Super Power in this world, She should accept immigrants from all over the world, especially the people who is working in the area of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.

2. The international students, who is working and will be working under OPT and STEM OPT Extension, are the right people who United States is looking for and will be relying on.

3. I know some american workers will object STEM OPT extension, but this rule is obviously beneficial for this country in a long range. Long-term benefit is more important than Short-term benefit, because that benefit is for future and our children.

The country and society only pursuing on short-term benefit cannot last long, it will fall soon.

For this country's future, let us support STEM OPT Extension!
