Anthony Pritchard I FULLY SUPPORT the OPT extension proposal. American people need to calm down. 
First, international students are NOT CHEAP LABORS. Companies offer the normal salary for STEM students. Low salary labors only happens when companies directly import workers from other countries. There's nothing to do with international students.

Many peoples also complains about the unemployment of Americans. HOWEVER, there is no evidence to support such opinion. STEM students can only work for the jobs related to their major. From the complaints, I can rarely find anyone mentioned about the detailed position for the unemployed people. THE OPPONENT DO NOT FULLY UNDERSTAND the regulation. They were told about the rules and got so sensitive that they wanted to oppose.
