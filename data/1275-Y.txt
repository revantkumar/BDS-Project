Contrary to many's belief, this is beneficial not only to foreign students, but to the United States as a nation as well. The US needs highly skilled workers from both within the U.S. and around the world to contribute to world-class innovation. By providing more opportunity for foreign students to practice their skills, the U.S. will actually gain more jobs because innovation and technology drives up economy. Therefore I strongly support the extension of OPT to STEM students.
