I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm a Ph.D student majored in Math. Before I came to US, I have other options such as an offer at Oxford University in UK. But I had always wanted to come to US for graduate study because I knew US has the most friendly environment for foreign students and the 17-month work opportunity of OPT. US is now the most attractive country for the most talented students because of this. In my case, the top 20% students from the my undergraduate university (top 3 in China) would choose to come to US for graduate study. This trend is the key to the successful research of the US universities. If we do not have the OPT extension, I believe most students would choose other options. It certainly would discourage the most talented students from all over the world to come and contribute to US. US is known to be the most open-minded country and it encourages people from all over the world to come and do their best to serve this country. I think it's the spirit of US, and I admire this spirit very much! The OPT extension would send the message of this spirit and attracts more young and talented students to come and do the most cutting-edge research both for themselves and for US!!!
As a STEM graduate student, I'm doing the most advanced research in my grad school and I certainly would like to apply my knowledge after my graduation in a company or research facility in US. Most of the international students in my department are in the same situation as me. Many research projects would last 2 years and without the OPT extension, we wouldn't get enough time to apply our knowledges in US companies. If we are forced to choose other companies in other countries because we don't have the OPT extension here, I believe it's a huge lost for US high-tech companies. 
In all, I believe the OPT extension is a smart decision and it would benefit both the US technology and the STEM students like me. I support it from the bottom of my heart!!!
