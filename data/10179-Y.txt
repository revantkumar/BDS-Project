Vijayrahul Pantham The rule is fine, My stem extension eligibility begins on Feb 02, 2015.This is the first time the rule is proposed there should be fine documentation provided regarding the steps needed to apply for stem extension ,that is a sample documentation related to Mentoring and training program that needs to be submitted to DSO , for eligibility of stem extension applying.There should be more appropriate documentation in a step wise manner about how to apply for stem extension needed to provided , so that we can provide appropriate comments on this rule making, This 107 page documentation should be converted into A flow chart diagrammatic representation, so when a person first sees that for the first time should get rough understanding of the rule making. My major question is weather the rule making gets finalized by Dec 19,2015.The Graduate Schools would also update these changes and provide appropriate directions to students of filing the extensions by feb 13,2015.As for me this kind of documentations provide extra burden on both employee and also employer , there are chances that the multi national companies would stop hiring opt students, with the purpose of avoiding heavy documentation they need to provide for this mentoring and training program.This also should be kept in mind when finalizing the rule making.As per me these are the primary concerns regarding the new rule making, a part from these ,there are students who need to apply for H1-B and stem extensions on a parallel basis, there would be lots of confusion ,in filing these two aspects in parallel manner.
