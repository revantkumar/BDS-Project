Honestly, I don't understand why people strongly against this rule or some even just blindly against any immigration law. Having more skilled immigrants can only be good for us!

From the history of this nation, a diverse and welcoming society only benefits us and never failed the people. That's why even laws about legalizing illegal immigrants are openly discussed and accepted.

So why we can accept millions of illegal immigrants but not legal and skilled ones?!

These skilled immigrants with high education background have already made huge contributions to our economy in high tech area. I don't mean to be hush to our own people, in certain area, they are making much more contribution because they are capable to do so. But where did those money those high tech companies made from these immigrants go? Taxes to government, to our benefit system, to our kids' education. Not to their own country.

Please also note, this is not even a law giving them citizenship, no green card, not any promise.

If we can even unconditionally accept illegal immigrants, I say, we shouldn't have any problem with this regulation for just letting skilled immigrants keep working for our companies a little longer!
