I think the new opt stem extension rule is a great step forward due to the reasons below:

1. STEM majors typically need more practical/on-job training than other ones so it is great to increase the duration to 24 months.

2. The new rule protects both international students in STEM majors and american labors since now it requires formal training plan from employers and increases the average wage.

3. Since the available number of H1B visa every year is still 85K, it is way better to let students have another chance to win the lottery by increasing the duration to 24 months.

4. United States needs the STEM majored students, by implementing this new rule, more and more students will be attracted to pursue a STEM major in US.
