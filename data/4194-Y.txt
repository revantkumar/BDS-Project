Obviously, this new regulation will benefit the hightech industry and eventually keep the United State be the most innovative country in the world. Some people may be against this regulation because they are worried about losing job opportunities, however they may not realize that prosperous IT industry can make more job opportunities. One simple example would be Uber.

The United States need young and innovative engineers because these young men and women are dedicated their life to the work that will make the United State a more glorious country. The world keeps changing, but US as the leader of the world, can keep its leadership because US can attract so many excellent scholars and students, which no other country can do better than US.

Also, this new regulation doesn't affect H1b visa, so there are still limited number of foreigners who can obtain a long time working permission. Those who don't get H1b are still going back to their country even though they spend the best time in their lives in contributing to the development of US.
