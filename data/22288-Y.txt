I am a graduate student of mechanical engineering from china. I strongly support the extension of the STEM OPT.

I have two brothers and one sister who are also study aboard. Only me choose to study in U.S because the Optional Practical Training program make me more competitive with 3 years practical experience comparing to the other students in other countries. Many potential graduate students think highly of this opportunities when they consider to receive high-level education in U.S. So that U.S education will attract more and more talented students from all over the world to make contribution to the U.S. economic.
