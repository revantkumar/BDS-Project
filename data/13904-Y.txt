I DO support the opt-extension. 
I think the people who disagree with the opt-extension are very ridiculous. They oppose opt-extension because foreigners will compete with our children and will do harm to them. But this is a fallacious reason. Have you ever heart of Catfish Effect? Our STEM foreigners are Catfish, what they are doing is making our children more competitive in the future. It is them that make your children know that no pain no gain. It is them that make our children feel nervous and more sedulous. Our protection is harmful to our children. Without foreign competitors, our children may say, oh, it is ok to play truant because there are many jobs waiting for me. Do you want our children to always feel safe and become shiftless? As an old saying goes, Adversity makes men prosperity. If you really want to do good to our children, to our future, we need those catfish to push our children, to make them work harder at school, to make them more competitive.
