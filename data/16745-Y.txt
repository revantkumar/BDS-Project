I strongly support this proposal about the STEM OPT extension.

First, as practice is a very important part to learning, the existence of abundant opportunities to practice the knowledges and skills learned is a critical advantage of the education industry in United States. I personally chose United States rather than many other countries because I learned about the properly long legal practicing period here, which is very important as it ensures me to have a chance work on a project completely without being disturbed by legal status issues. Giving up this advantage will significantly reduce the competitiveness of United States education industry.

Second, the saying that international skilled students are taking jobs away from United States skilled students is incorrect. I personally went to various career fairs and visited tens of companies. None of them prefers international students to domestic students. In the contrary, many of these companies prefer domestic students as these companies need to spend much more effort to accommodate the special needs of international students, such as their status in the United States. Thus international students are not taking jobs away from domestic students. The cause of the number of international skilled workers in the United States is the shortage of such workers here.
