Sean Ding, University of California, San Diego Advances in science and technology have always been the driving force in development and prosperity of our society and economy. Be it the advanced technology and high-production approaches in agriculture that enable a mere 2% of America's population to produce enough food and produce for both domestic consumption and foreign exports, or the advanced technologies developed during the Space Competition around the "Cold War" era and later trickled down to every aspects of our society including Satellite communication, personal computers, and the whole Internet, or the advances in medicine, clinical and surgical technologies that give birth to new life-saving ways and medicine, 
these world-leading technology advances have tremendous and profound impacts on every aspect of our society, and an edge in Science and Technology makes America the most powerful country in the world. 
Keeping this edge in advanced science and technology is determinant for the future of US, and the "people" resource is a critical (and arguably most important) part in developing and bringing about these advances. Students trained in programs with STEM degrees will become the future engineers and architects in these scientific fields, yet due to limits in current immigration laws and policies, some non-immigrant students don't obtain sufficient time to find a fitting position beyond their degrees where they can deploy their skills and talents, and are forced to leave the country before they can contribute to it. Such are great losses to America, and these losses will be detrimental to the country in the long run since these lost talents to America become contributors to other countries. 
An extension to the Optional Practical Training program will help in retaining these talents by allowing extra time and opportunities to students in STEM to find fitting positions where they get to use what they learn. An improvement in OPT program policy will invariably benefit America as a whole in many profound ways beyond the immediate impacts.
As such, I wholeheartedly support the improvement and extension of the Optional Practical Training programs and hope US will always keep its edge in science and technology and remain the greatest country in the world. May god bless America and its people.
