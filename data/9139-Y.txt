The United States is becoming less attractive to foreigners especially for those STEM workers and students. This is because the prosperous of technology development in the countries like China, India. Although US is still leading in the cutting-edge technologies of computer, electronics, people would think more about the cost and payback before they choose to come to US for study or working. The cost is much and payback would be really low as the short-term of OPT. They would always get a good job which has as much pay as it is in US and don't have to worry about being laid off just because of the eligibility of working. As a consequence, the universities would find it harder to collect fund as the lack of tuition income from the international students. The development of the universities will slow down which would affect the amount of US native graduates. And the lack of talents will then affect the development of US economy.

All in all, I strongly agree with the proposed rule of 24-month OPT. As this will finally make for the US economy.
