I strongly support the expanded OPT program. Human resource is the key factor that a society thrives or not. America is an immigrant-friendly society that welcomes all the capable foreigners to come and make contributions. The talented and diligent STEM students have been offered the opportunities to practice their professional skills via OPT. The new proposal can encourage those who are still hesitating if it worth to get limited practical training in such a short time as the current OPT indicates. Given more time, the STEM students will obtain better experience in their own field. In the meantime, the expanded OPT shows the determination of America to attract foreign elites, who have the potential to become an undeniable group for better development of the country. I believe the expanded OPT is a win-win opportunity for the welfare of the whole society.
