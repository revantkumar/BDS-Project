I have to say that those people who will benefit from the STEM OPT Extension are among the most laborious people. We have to study hard during our high-school and university life in our own country to get the opportunity to study master degree here. Actually we did have the chance to study in our own country then. But we come here because we believe America is not a country of xenophobia and we can achieve our dream by what we learn here. What's more, it has nothing to do with immigration or citizenship, but is about whether America is still an open-minded country that everyone here, no matter where we come from, could contribute ourselves to this country and achieve our dream.
