I think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is a resonable length for OPT program. Based on my previous research experience and current experience at CMU, most large software development projects would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion.
