As a US citizen with a STEM major, I do not believe this regulation will let international students take away jobs from us. On the contrary, these international students create tens of thousands of job opportunities for us US citizens. These jobs are not only for STEM students like me, but also for everyone else in any area as well. 

The proposal needs our support. We US citizens welcome talented and diligent international students. We support this regulation.
