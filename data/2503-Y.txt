Yi Qu, Columbia University The STEM extension is directly related to the choice of stay or leave for so many international students. As one of them, I knew that Opt is my only legal way to stay in US after I graduate in Dec. If Opt can only last for one year, it means that I have to apply for H1b within 2 month after I graduate and must have the luck to get the Visa, I assume the probability of that will be less than 10%. That is very disappointed future, but true fact for us.

Most of STEM students are well educated, hard-working and smart people, I guess most of us hoping to work in US for at least two or three years as a very precise working experience for us and as a kind of pay-back for the education we got here. I believe everyone living in this country deserve equal opportunity to learn and work, and we are so excited to see government step forward for equality and diversity.

Besides that, I believe 2 years extension will encourage more brilliant international students to study in US and college and university will directly benefits from that.
