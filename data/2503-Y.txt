This is a really good proposal, which is beneficial to the US government and academic sector.

Statistics shows that every year foreign students bring the US government huge amount of income. And for private schools the tuitions are also used to publish papers, improve the study environment, or to improve the teaching quality. And foreign students also help US academic sector and universities to remain competitive internationally.

Failing to provide students OPT extension would scare foreign students away for sure. If it's hard for them to remain legal status soon after their graduation, students would choose other countries instead of US. This will definitely be a loss to the government income and also to the US academic sector.
