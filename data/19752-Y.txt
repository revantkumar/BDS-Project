Whenever something good is born, it always takes a while to reveal itself. In 2014 alone, international students in the 50 states of America contributed over 27 billion dollars. Where do you think all this money go? They help create ten times the jobs that you think are taken away by immigrants. Why do you think this happens? Because the international students that come to America nowadays are not the same as the ones that came 10 or 20 years ago. In the 1990s, all the other countries look to US as the most powerful, and wealthiest country and people in such countries all want to come to US to become rich. But now, things are changing. Most students that I know come here to spend and when they are done with their time, they leave with no regret. Because there're better things waiting for them at home.
Please do not worry too much about immigrants, because most of the time the potential immigrants are usually not immigrants in the end.
