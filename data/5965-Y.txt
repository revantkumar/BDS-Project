I really think this proposal is doing the right thing.
International STEM students are like new blood to America's hightech industry,which is booming the whole economy,making everything more efficient.
And it's not like they are taking jobs from natives,they are just filling the work force gap unfufilled by natives.
It's really a good move to create better environment for them to server America.
