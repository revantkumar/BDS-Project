I am a supporter of this proposal.

As a foreign STEM student, my institute in the US has provide me with excellent research experiences in my own field. It is no doubt that the US has the best academic institutes and resources in STEM fields. STEM people in the US are focused on promoting the improvement of human knowledge and quality of life, which is the ultimate objective of people over the globe and should not be limited by nationality. In a fast changing world where new and urgent challenges are taking place, cooperation and communication should be an easy and fast way to gain achievements.

I chose to study in the US because no other countries can offer me such opportunity of "cooperation". In fact, current prosperous state of the STEM fields in the US has proved that it is never done by one person or one group of people. It is exactly because of people from various cultural backgrounds and with different inspects that lead to the richness and possibilities of new findings and developments in STEM fields. Thus I really hope this proposal will be approved because 1 year will not be enough for proper cooperation. Seriously, most of the time, an STEM project is in its starting phase in it's first year.

In addition, for international students who intend to go back to home country like me, a well-strained 3-year of working can be a valuable experience after going back home. These group of people have direct experience of cooperation and are probably most aware of the strength of diversity. It is very possible that a much larger scale of cooperation and communication can be established by these people and thus more working opportunities will be created.
