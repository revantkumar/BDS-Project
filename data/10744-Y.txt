The current time-constrain can create multiple moral hazard issues that counteract the original and on-going intentions of this regulation - to afford the opportunity, through market forces, of applying academic training and gaining real world experience to F-1 students, and accessing human capital to U.S. firms. 

However, it is important to note, different industries, markets and or geographies will have different business cycles and hiring cycles, and the length of the cycles can vary due to economic conditions. This results in a mismatch of demand cycles for human capital - skilled F-1 students - and the rather fixed supply cycles - graduation seasons. 

Given that both demand and supply sides make decisions conditioned on the time-length prescribed in the current regulations, the option of waiting for a better "fit" is often quickly eliminated for both sides, leading to loss-loss outcomes. Some more perverse scenarios are also made possible, due to the exploitation of this lack of time as an option. I am sure the petitioner and the regulators are aware of such cases and the negative social externalities they create. 

By extending the time-constrain to a longer period, we can "smooth out" some of the cycles and allow the OPT program to carry out its intended purposes.
