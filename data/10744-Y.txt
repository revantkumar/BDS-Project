Chudi Huang I STRONGLY SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. For international student who considering study aboard, a longer OPT period can be a reason for them to choose the State instead of other counties. We all know that in Europe, tuition are much lower than in most private colleges in the State. So if the OPT extension is cancelled, why international students would choose US? And what's worse, in most private colleges, international students means large amount of money. So if less international students are choosing US, it would be a disaster for education development in US.

2. For most of high technology companies, more than 50% of employers are international students. If 
OPT extension are cancelled, it would slower their path of developing high tech products, which is a loss for all country.
