Leon Li I support this program. I think America is a country giving more opportunities to the talented skilled international students. Because of this reason, many talented international students gathered here to make contributions in their research field or corresponding industry, meanwhile promote the development of America. 
There may be some shortage existing in this program, but there are also many advantages to give more time for the international student to practice their technique in America. First, no doubt, in the expanding time, the international students will work for the industry of America, this will lead to the contribution to America. Second, this program can attract more and more talented international students. Finally, this program is related to the American spirit which makes the America to the America today.
