I am providing my personal experience in supporting OPT STEM for F-1 student. I graduated from Cornell University with a master degree in Statistics on May 25th 2015 and joined American Express as a Marketing Analytics Manager on August 17th 2015. I have been working at Amex for almost 3 months and now take the responsibilities for leading the marketing analysis of 3 product - FX International Payment, Inspirato, and Consumer International Payment. All these 3 products do not only bring the company significant revenue income, but also benefit Amex global customers with superior services and less costs. I, as marketing analysis manager with Statistical background, can leverage what I learned from a US university to maintain and develop the business of a US company and bring the benefits to US customers.
I am in a team with three US residences and one Indian who got his H1b sponsorship 3 years ago when he was in OPT extension. My team now look very close to the progress of STEM and concerned about what is going on, especially my leader who is very satisfied with my performance. She is very afraid that the projects would get seriously delayed since I am the only one in the team who has Statistical modelling background, if STEM got cancelled.
OPT STEM is extremely necessary for F-1 students like me who are managing profitable projects and contributing to US companies.
