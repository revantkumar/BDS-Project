The United States of America is suffering from a government-induced recession. People are out of work, college grads are working as waiters, and many others have just quit looking. Bringing more foreign workers into the US at this point in our history will only make matters worse. We have enough skilled workers to fill any and all needs. Businesses want to cut payroll costs with cheap labor but that will only hurt America, overall. Don't let more foreigners in now.
