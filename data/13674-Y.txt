As a local tech business owner, I truly support this extension. In the last several years, I hired a lot of international student who just came out of school, they are not just great, they are excellent. They work much harder than most of others, of course we offer the same pay. I would say, in some way they improved the standard of the whole tech industry. I would sincerely support this proposal and hope I can see more stem students make great changes to this nation.
