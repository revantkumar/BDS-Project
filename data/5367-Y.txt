I strongly support this rule. I can see some people commenting negatively towards such a great rule. I would like to support by providing following benefits pf this rule with some real proofs and data. I can provide so many benefits of this rule that 5000 characters are not enough so I am submitting 3 separate comments to support this rule.

1) International Students added a whooping 26.8 billion dollars to US economy in a single year of 2013-2014
2) You must be aware about thousands of dollars international students pore in the US economy every year by paying 
huge international fees
3) International students created or supported 340,000 jobs in a single financial year of 2013-2014, for every 7 
international students enrolled, 3 US jobs are either created or supported.

Please go through attached report from NAFSA that supports this facts

4) If this rule is issued then international students will stay in USA for longer time and they may start their own enterprises 
in USA with ideas and experience they have accumulated from around the world
5) If this rule is not issued , international students will go and they will settle somewhere else. This will be a huge blow to 
the legal immigration process which everyone claims to support
6) International Stem students are the cream of the candidates standing in that long queue for legal immigration. Check 
the history of United States and the contribution of international technical students
7) International students bring money, skills and jobs in USA
8) International students contributed almost US$27 billion to the US economy in 2014, which corresponds to a 12% 
increase versus 2013 when the total was US$24 billion
9) By 2017, the global middle class is projected to increase its spending on educational products and services by nearly 
50% - from US$4.4 trillion in 2012 to US$6.2 trillion
