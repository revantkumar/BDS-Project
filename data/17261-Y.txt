I support the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule. Competition, diversity and fairness are what makes our country great. Real good talents are not afraid of competitions, and they will find a job anyways. Instead of whining about the immigrant policies, I'd rather use the time improving myself. These immigrant policies are not the root cause of unemployment.
