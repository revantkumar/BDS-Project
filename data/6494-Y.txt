Yu Jiang Dear Immigration and Customs Enforcement Bureau Officer 

I give my strong support to the proposed rule of extending OPT for 24 months for STEM students.

An increasing number of international students in the United States demonstrates the great value of the higher education system in this country. In particular, the OPT program successfully provide students enough time for training and practicing what they have learned. This unique program differential the US higher education system from anywhere else, and is effectively attracting top students from all over the world.

Most international students will eventually return to their home countries once they finished their education and training. But during their presence in the US, they significantly stimulate the economy. The tuition they are paying and the living cost they are spending are helping to create more job opportunities, because the schools can hire more faculty and staff members. New restaurants, shopping centers, and grocery stores are opened to provide the increasing needs of international students. National parks and other areas of attractions are expecting more and more visitors who are international students and their families. The transportation system is benefited by the travel volume of international students.

Without such an OPT program, the value of the US higher education system will be jeopardized and will turn away international students. Anyone turely loves this country should not allow this to happen. Please go ahead and pass the proposed rule.

Sincerely
Yu Jiang, PhD
