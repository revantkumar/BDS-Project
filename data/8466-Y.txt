Yueheng Ran I strongly support OPT expansion. It is not only beneficial to international students, but also, or means even more for U.S. International students study in universities, U.S. education system benefits. International students need to eat every day, U.S. restaurants and grocery stores benefit. International students live, U.S. house owners benefit. International students work for U.S. companies, U.S. companies benefit. International students submit tax, U.S. government and U.S. people benefit.

Some people declare that OPT extension reduces their work opportunities, and I suggest them to examine themselves before complaining about the policy. U.S. seeks equality among all people, and that is a big reason why it is being respected. U.S. uses OPT to show that it doesn't discriminate international students. If even international students don't get discrimination, why should those people assume the country discriminates its own citizens?

A person can be strong only if he or she is not afraid of competitions, and a country can be strong only if it knows how to take advantage of talented people, not giving them away to other countries. If those talented people work for other countries, who will be impacted in the last? Think about it.

Thanks,
Yueheng
