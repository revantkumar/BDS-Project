I am strongly support this rule.

As a COMPUTER ENGINEERING master student from China. I chose to come to here because the cut-edge theory and technology come from the universities here. There has the best scholar other than the universities in the rest of the world. Also, there used to be a 12+17 months extension rule for STEM students like myself. This provides much more opportunity for us to practice what we learn here. The best academic atmosphere and great practice opportunities made the universities in United States the best universities in this world.

Second, for the universities, the extension rule help them attracted so many talents all over the world bring creation and passion. Both financially and academically, universities gained whole a lot of benefits from this rule.

Third, for the companies. The extension aimed at STEM students. In this field, generally, commercial projects usually last more than 20 months. It will be really horrifying for companies to replacing existing engineers or researchers in the middle of projects.

Personally, I strongly support this extension rule. It has huge advantages for students themselves, universities and companies in relative fields. All of them will gain great benefits from this rule who is been affected.
