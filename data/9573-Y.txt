Keven Wang I strongly support this rule! As international STEM students we spent lots of money studying abroad. If we cannot have enough time to get working experience, studying in US will be less attractive. The 24-month OPT extension is great. If we can work here for 3 years as junior engineers, we'll probably be able to find senior positions when we return to our own countries.
