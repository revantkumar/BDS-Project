I have to say I really support the new OPT extension program. As an engineering recruiter, it is really hard to get enough candidates with those talented students from other countries who are willing to stay in the states and work for American companies. Someone might say will the longer OPT will threaten the American workers. However, without OPT, US will lose so many talented students that could have been able to contribute to the development of US technologies, and be hurt in a longer term.
