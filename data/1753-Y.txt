Stephen Arnold International students are also helping to fill skills shortages at a time when the US share of the world's science and engineering graduates is declining. Diversity is what makes this country the best country in the world. If this rule is not issued then I think we are going to loose our identity. STEM graduates should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy. Hiring international students does not mean stealing jobs from Americans. I personally did not see ANY American students with STEM degrees and decent GPAs get unemployed.
