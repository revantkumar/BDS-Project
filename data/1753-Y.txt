I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international computer engineer master student from China and was a software engineer intern at Kayak. Before I came to US, I had multiple choices to purse my master degree in US, Canada, Hong Kong and British. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM students. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. 

When I did my intern at Kayak, a lot of my colleagues worked at that company as opt status. If the STEM extension terminate, there will be a huge impact to the company. I can't imagine what will happen if a company lost lots of engineer in such a short time. And from my perspective, the technology company paid many resources to train a new employee. They must expect the opt students will stay as longer as possible.

I hope the government reconsider the new rule that is a win-win to international students and US.
