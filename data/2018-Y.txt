I support the new Expanding Training Opportunities for F1 students with STEM major degree rule. It helps our tech companies in here to maintain competitive advantages. 

It's not like expanding all international students' opportunities to stay here, but only those with the specialty we need. We need to stay competitive by giving them more opportunities. If they want to stay longer, they still need to apply for working visa.
