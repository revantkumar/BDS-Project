My cousin just got laid off again. He has worked over 15 years in all phases of the computer industry. He is a 60 year old Veteran of the Marine Corp. It is not at all appropriate to obtain more foreign workers while qualified American workers go jobless or outside their expertise in less productive work.

There are over 2 million unemployed residents of the United States with a bachelor's or higher STEM degree.

There are about 10 million Americans with STEM degrees not working in their specialties, many of whom would return to those fields with appropriate incentives.

The OPT foreign workers will displace graduating Americans who are struggling to repay massive student loans.

By turning the F-1 student visas into 3-year work visas, DHS is doing an end run around Congressional limits on H-1b 3-year work visas.

There are already over 125,000 workers in OPT programs and over a half million potential foreign workers with F-1 visas, yet Americans who graduate are finding a stagnant job market in STEM fields.
