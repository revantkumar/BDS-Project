Xiao Liu I support this proposal because I do not think it will have negative impact on US workers. After all, there is a time limitation on hiring STEM students. So if there are two students who have the same skill levels - one is international and the other is US. Employers will prefer to hiring the US students because the process is much easier and they won't face the problem of OPT expiration in the future. So I do not think this policy will hurt US workers.Therefore I support this proposal.
