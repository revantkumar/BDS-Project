I work for a big global company and am on H1B visa, so this proposed rule does not really affect me. But I need to state a fact. 
This month my company decided to stop hiring foreign employees, because H1B visa limits travel, and for some employees travel is mandatory.
My practice sifted through the resumes they received and only one candidate is US citizen. Because my field is STEM, very few Americans are studying it. If my company really stops hiring foreign employees entirely, my practice will be left in a very awkward and disadvantageous position. 
US needs people to work in the STEM field. Being open is what kept America a great country. Only by remaining open can US stay competitive in the world.
