Great news if this can really work out! I believe it's the same reason behind this proposed rule that make America, an open, diversiform country the strongest in this world.

"Research has also shown that foreign-born workers are particularly innovative, especially in research and development, and that they have positive spillover effects on native-born workers. One paper, for example, shows that foreign-born workers patent at twice the rate of U.S.-born workers, and that U.S.-born workers patent at greater rates in areas with more immigration." Truly it is.

Some people may be object to this rule because they think that their jobs are taken away. But in fact many international students get their jobs in high-tech area, which I believe will eventually promote america's job markets in the near future. So don't be near-sighted.
