First of all, I wish it could be passed. 

I think it's important to U.S economic marketing. the technology company hire those STEAM student to create fancy product for america. those product helped american citizen easier life, and make more job opportunity for people. think about it, if there are lot of products like iPhone. what will happen? then those company will hire a lot of sales, they will build more store like apple store. and more labor will be hired for construction. then they need more marital for constriction, then they need driver to shipping ..............

Keep a country develop depends on high cut edge technology company, knowledge, core technology.
