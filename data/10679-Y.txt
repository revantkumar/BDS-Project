I support this proposal, because after international students have paid some serious money for their education overseas, they deserve proper and sufficient training in the field that they have been studying. Otherwise, no one will choose to study in the US anymore and it will hurt US's education economy. Besides, for STEM programs, US does not have sufficient pool of graduates from this field to support the high-tech economy, which is also part of the reason why foreign talents in this field can always find jobs. They deserve their career opportunities in this country.
