Rather than increase foreign worker immigration--both legal and illegal--the challenge to improve both job opportunities and market-based pay for American Workers is to significantly reduce or stop the flow of immigrants. This proposed rule does quite the opposite and must be stopped. 

Until the border is secure and all illegal immigrants have been disqualified from government-mandated entitlements, denied access to other government benefits designed for citizens, and also banned from any employment by enforcing employer sanctions using eVerify, there is no justification for yet another way to encourage immigration to the US. Reducing immigration and even reversing illegal immigration would have the further benefit or encouraging citizens and permanent residents to find work rather than seek benefit payouts. Attempts to increase immigration in the midst of an invasion are blatantly and unconscionably destroying middle America for the benefit of big business and politicians.

As an added insult, this proposal, like in-state tuition benefits for illegals, actually affords greater opportunity to immigrants than to citizens. Such a rule as this should not be allowed.
