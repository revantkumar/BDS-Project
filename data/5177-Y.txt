I strong support the extension of STEM. Very few of my PHD friends do not find a job here in the U.S. after graduation. The need is obvious and many of them are in the process of getting green cards. I cannot imagine if we are not allowed to work in this country after graduation. It hurts the companies that require the skills of the foreign students, hurts the admission of the universities, and is unfair to the students who expect to work in the U.S. before starting their programs here.
