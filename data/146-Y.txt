I strongly SUPPORT this new OPT policy!

1. OPT extension gives international students more opportunities to achieve their "American dreams", thus it will attract more and more international students come to here, international students pay much more tuition than native students, this is a very big extra income for American education. 

2. foreign students working on OPT PAY TAX and they help local economies. Without foreign students, US universities and research institutions will face huge loss.Those property renting, food service and other industries will face huge loss.

Therefore, I highly support this new policy and really hope this could be APPROVED!!!!
