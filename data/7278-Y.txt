Jesse Malkin The OPT program, a de facto guest worker program, has never been approved by Congress. In a republic, laws are supposed to be made by elected officials, not by unelected bureaucrats. If lawmakers support this program, let them discuss it on Capitol Hill in full view of the public.

If Congress held hearings on OPT, it would discover that many American STEM workers, especially recent college graduates, are having difficulty finding good jobs (i.e., jobs in their fields of study). Every "training opportunity" (aka a "job") given to a foreign student via OPT is a slot that can't be filled by an American.

It is time to look at the big picture. At at time when wages of tech workers are flat and millions of Americans are unemployed or underemployed, Congress should eliminate or dramatically reduce OPT, H-1B, L-1, and other cheap-labor guest worker programs. Foreigners who are truly the "best and brightest" can come here on O-1 visas. Since 1990, more than 100,000 O-1 visas have been given to foreigners with extraordinary abilities in the arts, science, education, business, or sports. That is more than enough.

The fact is that OPT serves foreigners and the companies who hire them, not American workers. For once, let's put U.S. workers and U.S. students first.
