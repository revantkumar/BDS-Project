I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. 
This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. 

How could you consider doing this? Day after day on radio and television our children are sold the lie about how their futures are assured if they get a degree in one of the STEM fields. It's all a lie. Behind the scenes, as they mortgage their futures to train in these fields you give their competition an unfair advantage they can't overcome. Flooding the job market with these people has nothing to do with Homeland Security and everything to do with your greed. What will you do when the economy collapses in on itself when there are not enough people to buy the homes and cars and consumer items needed to keep it going? Perhaps you have a plan to import consumers too.
