Weiqi Zhang Longer OPT will definitely serve for better U.S in various ways. The major theory is quite simple: longer OPT will attract more elite students from other countries to work for America and help promote the technological strength of America, which will be a major impetus for economic growth in the future. If America fails to retain these talented students due to short OPT, then there's no point for international admission since America would be exporting their advanced technology to other countries. Too bad for America. I know many Americans are saying things like "those immigrants are robbing our jobs"... Truth is STEM-related jobs have high requirements, and apparently many of these people are not qualified for those jobs. In this case if America keeps losing those talented people, America will be losing not just jobs, but also the technological, economical and social advantages that older generations of this country have accumulated over years by applying an open culture to attract smart people from everywhere.
