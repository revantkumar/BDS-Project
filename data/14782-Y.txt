Most foreign students who major in STEM are exception people in their countries. OPT gives them a chance to make contribution to US. And it is also a chance for US to keep more talented people and make the society better. This is a win-win situation. If US cut the OPT extention period which will force the majority of those talented people out of US, US will lose a huge of amount of high level labors and also reduce the overall education level of the whole population. As an immigration country, US need the continue absorbing talented people so that US could continue to be strong. So why not to approve OPT extension?
