I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the new 24 month-extension of STEM OPT for three most important reasons: 1. The U.S. allowing an OPT extension for international students majoring in a STEM subject can continuously boost the economy and technology development of the country, which benefits everyone of America as well. 2. The job competition caused by international students can positively enhance candidates' quality improvement. If we let a tremendous amount of skilled human resources outflow from the U.S., it will surely be a huge loss to the domestic companies and the country, comparing with foreign competitors. 3. Social diversity is also a benefit for the U.S. It gathers various cultures and thoughts, from different perspective of view. Further, it prevents bias and aligns with human rights.
