This proprosal is very humanities and considerate. It provides the foreigners who have great abilities to devote to the states and create proficiency, showing that US is inclusive and welcoming all different people with their talents and strength. Also by allowing more foreigners to work for longer time in the states, you can see the cultural shock and how different people share ideas by working together. You can never imagine how creative an idea will be when people from various backgrounds come up with together. However to achieve this goal the limited spaces in H1B is not enough. OPT especially STEM part allows more scientific talents to have more opportunities in the states. It's not only a good way of keeping more and more valuable people but also an efficient way of producing profits. It is a win-win proposal so please consider it seriously!
