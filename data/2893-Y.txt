Karunasagar Dheram I desire to comment on this proposed 24 Months STEM OPT Extension rule.

I strongly support the proposed 24 months STEM OPT Extension Rule.The proposed STEM OPT Extension Rule will help both the foreign students and American economy in turn. This shall make for a strong attraction for foreign students to pursue their higher education in US which brings in a lot of money too. It must be borne in mind that the technological supremacy of US depends to a great extent on the contributions of individuals from nations all over the world. 

I like to see this rule published and implemented thus also helping highly Skilled and Highly Motivated students in F-1 status who are contributing to U.S. Innovation, scientific discovery, technology improvements and U.S. economy.
