I strongly support this rule. When I see those comments from US citizens talking about the stem extension will steal american's jobs, I am pretty sure it is from some anti-immigration group providing people the WRONG information. Frist of all, if a company is able to hire the same level of tech workers from citizens, they will absolutely do it without thinking. Citizen worker will require less training, paper work, no visa issue. So then the question becomes, why companies are hiring international students. The FACT is, they are more trained than natives. It is not because they are paid less, those high tech workers made 100k+ dollars which is way more than some of the haters shown in the comments. And they help grow the local economy. The data shows that in 2014, the F-1 students contribute 27 billion dollars to US economy. If you guys want those money out, fine, oppose this law.
