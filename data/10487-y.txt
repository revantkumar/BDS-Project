Jay Chou I am a STEM PhD student at Caltech, this rule provides a great opportunity for foreign students who work hard and also talented to have better opportunity to further practice what they have learnt at the university. While they are doing their OPT, building their own practical professional experience, they have also contributed a lot to the development of US, technically and economically. This rule would benefit both the foreign students and also the US society. I myself support it much.
