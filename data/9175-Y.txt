I am opposed to extending the amount of time an F-1 visa holder can remain in the country to 36 months. Allowing these students to compete for potential jobs which could go to American citizens puts our own citizens in an environment which is brazenly unfair. After completing their education, F-1 visa holders should return to their countries where they will not be in a competitive disadvantage by foreign students competing for their jobs. In essence, we are doubling the number of H-1B visas in this country which makes potential employment for Americans much more difficult. We have already extended a gigantic advantage by issuing an F-1 visa. These foreign students should recognize the advantage they have been provided and return to their own countries to help build them up.
