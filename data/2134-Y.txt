International students in advanced STEM degrees need to serve to the growth of US economy. For this OPT extension is the first step. There has been considerable innovation and technical human resources moving out of USA into countries like Israel. The students need enough opportunity to explore technically and also implement entrepreneurial ventures. I also request the authorities to provide the same platform to explore entrepreneurial ventures for students in OPT. The innovative and powerful young STEM graduates with advanced degrees would help US solve all the small problems US is facing bit by bit. This would be helpful to promote social entrepreneurs.
