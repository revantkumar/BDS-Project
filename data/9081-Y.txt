I do strongly support this. I think our technical companies plays an important role in our economy. As far as I know, our president Obama has been encouraging people to learn programming. Which means that we do have large demand for these techinical workers. If we let them leave, who will join us to grow the industry. We do have citizens, but the fact is that there seems to be few people who do show the interest in this part..I will foresee that technical companies will seek more opportunities outside us just for more talents, just like our cars industry. We do remember the bankrupt of Detroit. To attract talents from all over the world has always been beneficial for United States. Just as what we ave been doing before and after world war 2'. We cannot refuse talents, just like we cannot refuse knowledge. That.s the only way we can move forward and make US better and better!
