Jayden Zheng The extended OPT must definitely help U.S in the long-turm, no matter in the economy or in the human right. Everybody comes to U.S for the American dream, this dream cannot build without people. No matter they are local, or international students. 

The international students spend tons of money to go abroad to learn knowledge, they want to devote themselves in U.S community after graduation. 

I hope the government can extend the OPT time and support the international students this time
