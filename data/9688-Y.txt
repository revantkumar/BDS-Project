I took a look at most of the previous comments. It seems like those who disapprove of this 24-month stem extension are generally US citizens, and 
the common reason being pointed out is that stem international students have taken too many job opportunities away. However, one major factor that keeps US
strong and powerful in the world is its diversity and the many significant 
contributions made by people from different parts of the globe. When US citizens complain about losing jobs because of so much competition from stem 
international students, why do they not try to make themselves more competitive ? Competition is not a bad thing, but rather it is what keeps a nation going. What I've seen is most legal citizens keep complaining about losing employment 
opportunities as stem international students accept low wage jobs. However, as far as I know, most stem international students, who were majored mostly computer science, biological science, electrical engineering, and math, own well-paid jobs. They paid expensive tuition in college; They studied much harder than others; They experienced hard time while searching employment. They earn what they deserve. There are much more approaches to creating employment opportunities other than deporting hard-working stem international students from this country.
