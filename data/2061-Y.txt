I strongly support the extension based on the following reasons:

1, They can make great contributions to the U.S. The opt extension brings USA high quality labor force. As we all know, the opt extension is for the students who have at least a bachelor degree in STEM. Some of them even have a master degree in STEM majors. They are preciousness labors who can do a great contribution for the development of U.S. No country will reject them!

2, Competition is not a bad thing. These student can strengthens American students' competitiveness. With these students in USA, more American students will turn the pressure into motivation. Always remember that escaping is not a way to success. American students have to face to the competition and do their best to win.

3, The 24 months extension time is necessary for OPT program. Most large research development projects would last more than 2 years. Foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before completion without the extension.
