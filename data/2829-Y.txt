I strongly support this new rule and believe it will pass finally. We need to know the fact that the students who are qualified for OPT and OPT extension are actually the people with top talent, and thus valuable to the US economy. According to some public statistic, it is often the case that hundreds, even thousands people would compete for one job position. A candidate would have to pass 8, or more rounds of interviews and tests to get the job. Once an international students cannot get a job in three months after they graduate, they will be forced to leave US. That's the reason why I claimed that the OPT students (i.e., the students who can land a jobare elite in US industry. In WWII, many European scholars came to US to escape from the war. That is an important reason why US become the strongest and most successful countries in the world. All of these suggest us it is not wise to close the door for the foreigners (especially the talented foreigners)
