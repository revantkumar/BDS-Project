Zhigang Wang I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The extension provides a good opportunity for students who has already acquired technology to contribute to the country, pushing them away from the country will lead to decreasing number of talent foreign students in US in the future.

2. Equality , liberty and diversity are all spirits of the States, it's important to show that spirit not only to the citizens, but also to the whole world through it's policy against nonimmigrant students.

3. There is no direct evidence showing that the working permission of F1 students will lead to high unemployment rate in US. Allowing foreign students to work will maintain a competitive labor market and will finally improve US citizens' skills and technology.
