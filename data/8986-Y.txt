I support the new OPT Stem extension rule which provides better opportunities for international students to better learn about the technology advancements in the US. As companies are spending millions of dollars in training the new students it would not be fair if the H1 visa is not picked for an employee and has to leave the country all of a sudden. The new rule of 2 years extension would provide a chance for students to better apply the knowledge from the training for atleast 2 years in case of H1 not picked in the lottery.

I highly support the new OPT rule and looking forward for its implementation.
