As an international student, we are very much disadvantaged on the job market. We need to fit in the culture, need the sponsorship from our employer and face a lot of mental pressure. A 24-month OPT extension is the least the government can help us to get a job that is equivalent to the money, time and effort we put in our education and the skills we get from it.
