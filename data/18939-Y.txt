The proposed 24-month PTO Extension time will definitely give more flexibility for both students and employers on dealing with the work visa process. Some employer won't provide immediate H1-B sponsorship because they don't know if it's worth investing without testing out the employee. Or if someone who has applied for but lost the lottery process will still have a second chance. The extended time will help both the students and employers solve the visa issue. Votes for passing the new regulation!
