I'm strongly for this proposal, for several reasons listed beneath.

First, real world experience is very valuable for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. Through on-the-job training, it will help STEM students gain valuable experience. Strong and excellent STEM students will help American agencies and companies create much more successes.

Second, F-1 students promoted American economy with their intuition and their creation to academic and real-world aspects. 

Third, new proposal will not influence American students' interest, for this new proposal has provided many very useful and practical ways to protect American students' interest. Like this proposal would require terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity (including duties, hours, and compensation) to be commensurate with those applicable to similarly situated U.S. workers.

In all, this proposal is great in protecting American students interest and protect American interest.
