I am a scientist working in University of California. I became an US citizen in 2004. I earned my PhD degree in Physics in an US university and obtained permanent residence in 1993. 

In the past two decades, I work as a scientist in US with collaborators and students from all over the world. In the current research environment, foreign students constitute an important part in many research areas in our country, such as in our research team. After graduation, many of them found suitable jobs in high-tech companies, national laboratories and universities in the US, made and continue to make important contribution to scientific / technological development and to US economy. I therefore strongly support that we provide foreign students with more opportunities to get on-job training by extending their OPT, so that we have a better chance of keeping them in the US. 

In today's world, competition is the competition in scholars and talents. Keeping more scholars in US will help keeping us maintain in the number one position in the world for the future. In long run, it also help booster our economy and create more jobs for domestic workers.
