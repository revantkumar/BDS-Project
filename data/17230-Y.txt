I totally support this new rules. To tell the truth, I think those who reject are either mislead or do not know STEM situations at all. I am a EE MS student. During my 2 years at school, I found that more than 90% percent of EE and CS students are foreign students. More than 2/3 of professors are also from foreign countries such as India and China. So if such rules does not pass, I think most of these foreign students, who could have helped a lot to industry field of US, and some of the foreign professors will have to leave this country. This may cause serious damage not only to industry fields but also to our education system.

I can not image a silicon valley without the help of foreign students and engineers, and I can not image hundreds of universities and schools without the help of foreign professors and mentors.
