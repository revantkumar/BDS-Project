I support this policy!!!! It is absolutely benefit for the US development. Because the technology talent workers and scientists are highly required in America, they contribute lots of value things at here year by year, if the extension is canceled immediately, lots of international students will lost their jobs and many positions cannot be filled, that will cause a huge economic loss for companies and society!! I`m also an international student and are working right now, I think the international students are hard working, smart, they are much more better than some American who complain they cannot get jobs just because of foreigners. Actually in my previous experiences, most of company would like to employ the American first even if our F-1 students are better than these citizens. So it is so ridiculous that many American people say they are unemployed because of our foreigners! And as an foreigner, I think we spend plenty of money to learn knowledge at here, we also should have equal opportunities to work at here. If the extension is canceled, many international students will lost trust for the American government.
