Roger Fuller I am a construction business owner.I believe the key of healthy economy is that follow the markets needs. I hired 3 international students in my company. I am impressed with their excellent performance. Hiring international students is not an easy decision for me to made, since there are many risks related to it. You never know whether the international employees I hired are lucky enough to win the H1B lottery or not. International employees communication skills are not as good as American graduates. Nevertheless, there are not enough high qualified American graduates for me hire. They are weak in professional knowledge, while international students know their course works very well. 
Dont interrupt the market. Simply respect the markets decision. If the market pick up international students, it means we need them for US economys benefit. We cant afford to lose them. The way to reduce unemployment rate is to train our graduate well, and equip them with professional knowledge, not stop OPT Extension.
