It is shortsighted to eliminate the STEM OPT extension. Some commenter insist that company tend to hire international students in a low salary. However this is not the fact. Employer will be sued if discriminate the international students and hire them in a low salary. What is more, if the OPT extension is canceled, a lot of international students will give up pursuing college or master degree in America. Many Chinese students had a chance to pursue master degree in many countries, such as Canada, Hong Kong and so on. OPT is the most attraction for them(including me). In fact, most students in China just want work experience in the US and then go back to China. They have family, friends over there. An extension of OPT will attract them more. A one year in company can help them a little. Maybe one can just get adjust to the life in company and learn nothing before he leave the company and devoted to the company. Company can not give international students big tasks because one year can make little effort to a huge tasks. But a 12 months regular + 24months will solve the technical problem. So I think a STEM OPT extension is beneficial to the company as well.
