I strongly support the new regulation not just because I am a foreigner who decide to have a professional practice at US, where I spent two years for my Master's Degree at Vanderbilt. I have the following reasons: firstly, a professional practical is very important for international students who paid expensive tuition fees studying at America, without it, studying at America learn much less just from school and textbooks. But without an extension, it would not be enough time for a student to become professional in his or her industry. Second, which is probably more important, proving a longer period for STEM student working for America is also beneficial to the American society. Attracting more talented people working in the fields where they are needed is no harm to ordinary Americans. Market competition makes flourish.
