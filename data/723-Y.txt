I support the proposed rule of 24 month STEM OPT extension. OPT provides international students to gain professional and cross cultural experience, which is one of the primary reasons why students choose to study outside their own country. I believe this increased duration of practical training is important for students to fully utilize the education they received. This rule will help the nation's universities attract the best talent from across the world in the field of science and technology. I congratulate DHS for putting forward a new rule in a short amount of time. I hope DHS keeps working to help the international student population and drive the nation forward.
