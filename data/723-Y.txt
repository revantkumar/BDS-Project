Jia Liu I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. As a matter of fact, because of existing restrictions on international students working in US, US companies only hire international students instead of American citizens when there aren't enough qualified citizens to hire, meaning that international students are not "stealing" job opportunities from citizens. Further restriction such as cancelling OPT extension will only damage the competitiveness of US enterprises. 

2. The most rational choice US government can make is to enhance domestic industries with the students who have gained their degrees in US and are eligible to fit in positions in US industries no matter they are citizens or not. Only by doing this can US industries remain competitive in the international market. 

Thank you.
