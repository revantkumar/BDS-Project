Thank you DHS for proposing the rule in a timely manner to avoid a lot of students with STEM degree form leaving the country. Since the H1B cap remains the same and the number of applicants are increasing exponentially, the companies that has hired STEM degree holders will lose experienced candidates. The number of applicants in 2015 for H1b was 233,000 with a limit of only 85000 people getting the H1B. So it's like 1 in 3 people got the H1B Visa. Having a total of 36 months of OPT gives the STEM degree holder 3 chances to try the H1B application. I feel the DHS needs to revisit the STEM extension period depending on the number of H1B applicants. DHS should increase the STEM extension to 36 months if there are 340,000 H1B applicants, 48 months if there are 425,000 H1B applicants and so on. So the rule needs a constant update to keep a balance between the number of H1B applications, number of H1B Visas granted and the number of months of OPT for a STEM degree holder.

As of now, I strongly support the proposed rule and would like the rule to be implemented soon so that STEM holders can take the advantage.
