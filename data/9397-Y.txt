To Whom It May Concern,

I strongly support the OPT extension for the following reasons:

1. OPT extension provides great benefits to medium and small American companies.For companies who cannot afford sponsoring a person with H1B visa and needs capable employees, OPT gives them an opportunity to hire well-educated students. In many industries, there are not enough American citizens for each company. Many startup companies simply cannot find enough highly-educated American employees. This makes OPT recipients ideal candidates for these companies. 

2. OPT extension does not prevent qualified Americans to find a job. It is a well known fact that the tech and science industry is in need of more people. An American who did not receive the corresponding education simply cannot get the job even if no international students are hired. In fact, we rarely hear any opposition from highly educated Americans to this OPT extension policy. On the contrary, the people who oppose the OPT extension are usually people with a lower education. OPT students are not even competing with them on the same ground. As a matter of fact, OPT extension can help these low educated people in the long run through making more successful American companies. It is more about making the pie bigger, instead of dividing up a pie which does not belong to the protesters in the first place. 

3. OPT extension is a fair and sound policy which will attract more talented people to come to America and make America great. United States is a country founded by immigrants. A important reason for America's success is that US can attract talented people from all over the world to work for the American dream. Shutting down doors is not a solution to America's current problems. It means betraying American tradition and will ultimately do great harm to the country in the long run. 

For the above reasons, I strongly support the OPT extension policy. 

Thank you for your time.
