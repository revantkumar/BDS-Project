The arguments regarding job stealing rely on a certain doubtful assumption that the existence of foreigners themselves is the reason that causes unemployment of some citizens. The real reason behind the change in the structure of employment in U.S. is market changes. These changes make companies raise different skills requirements and increase turnover rate. As illustrated in last paragraph, companies only ask for human resources with the right skills. In this case, competence comes before cramming. Employment of forgeiners is only an aspect of the outcome of these changes. Restraining the time for foreigners to work as an attempt to overturn the changes through policy pressure will not only have little effect toward but also negatively impact economy of the U.S. Thus, improper reverse argument renders itself unconvincing as it stands.
