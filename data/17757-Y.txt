I support this rule because it will increase the US competency in the world in general. We need these stem students as a work force because of the lack of native US work force in related field. Thus it will not affect the employment difficulty in these fields.

Moreover, the increased number of jobs in these stem field will eventually boost the need for other service, where more opportunities for other US citizens.
