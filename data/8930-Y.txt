I totally SUPPORT this new OPT policy, for this policy will bring a lot of benefits to United States. And all these negative comments provides NO valid evidence at all!

Internation students pay tuition to go to colleges in US and pay TEX as well, if they choose to work here. This, without double, helps the local economies. Without foreign students, US universities and companies will face a great loss of excellent works. So there might be no emerging companies like Facebook, Linkedin and so on.

The OPT policy will attract more outstanding students all over world to work in US. And development needs creative workers. If the number of novel workers is poor, the speed of development will decrease. Thus US may face serious problems in the next economic downturn.

Therefore, I highly support this new policy and really hope this could be APPROVED!!!!
