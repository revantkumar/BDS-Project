Jono Boult I am a US citizen and I work in an IT company. So many of my colleague are non-immigrants either working on H1 or on OPT. We regularly do discussion about this rule during lunch or break. One thing I can say from that discussion is that they have to struggle a lot to reach to this country and achieve the degree. Their parents spend all the money for their children's education. And even after achieving degree, more then 50% of companies don't accept them just because organizations don't want to spend money after H1 and green card sponsorship of this international students. They are not at all harmful for American citizens they are not taking away any of our jobs. They get chance only when organization doesn't find any suitable American citizen for that profile. That is why I request US government to make this rule permanent and help all international students to make their career.
