I strongly support the approval of Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students, as US needs the STEM OPT extension to stay competitive in technology innovation. 

Foreign students offer the critical mind-power and international expertise in US success of the age of information. 

Mind-power part is very self-explanatory. US has the world top STEM universities and therefore attract the world's top brains to study and, with the help of OPT, work here. They constantly bring new ideas from academia to industries through the OPT program after the graduation. A longer OPT period, which means the extension here, would make sure these top minds would stay in the industries longer and therefore create more synergies between technology and business, which is exactly what US needs to create more jobs and opportunities. 

More than the mind-power, international students help the US firms to expand internationally. These guys come to study in US are often smart and well-connected locally. By start working in US for US companies, they are able and often glad to bring US business back to their motherlands. These kind of local expertise is exactly what US business needs to compete in such a flat world. And a longer OPT period would make US business even more competitive.

So please approve the extension, we need the international STEM students and we need them to work here longer. It would benefit US technology industry, and eventually US people.
