I greatly support the regulation for STEM Extension. The reasons are as follows. Firstly, it is important to put what we have learned in class into practice, which OPT and STEM extension enables us to do so right after graduation. It usually takes over a year to be accustomed to the environment and to contribute to the company profoundly. It is important to give the international students a platform to show their abilities. Moreover, international students, who came here, are mostly elites in college. After graduation, they tend to work even harder than the native because they want to prove to everyone that the company made a good decision to hire them. Hard work is always appreciated by the company because it can not only bring more profits for the company but also inspire other employees. Overall, I am strongly for the regulation.
