I strongly support the new OPT policy.

The success of numerous startups and big high-tech companies cannot be separated from the contribution of international STEM talents. 

The good economics situation cannot be separated from numerous students coming from various countries -- they come to learn and contribute to the economics of US when they are studying and they deserve to get some training or practical study before going back to their hometown to make contributions.

Without the OPT, I cannot imagine how big the damage would be made to the entire industry in the United States -- the number of international students and potential talented workers will drop dramatically. This is not a scene we all want to see and this violate the principle of the United States, which is an inclusive place for hardworking people.

All in all, the new OPT policy is great and thus should be strongly supported! I strongly hope it could be approved in the end!
