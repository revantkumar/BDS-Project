I am work as an analyst in a large company in US after I got my master degree in STEM major in US, so does most of my collages. Most of US are considering use those OPT period to do some internship and learn from work after we graduate and leave school. As far as I know, my employer and other large high company are willing to hire foreign employee just because there are so few US citizens in my area, and the job market cannot fulfill their demands. To keep the economy and industry work in the right situation, my employer and other high tech company even the US government need us to stay longer in US and work for them.

However, after one or two years training in OPT time period, most of my foreign collages will finally go back to their home countries instead of staying in US. Since OPT STEM extension collaborate with small H1B quota, and long green card waiting time, the policies help US citizens to stop immigration waives while keep foreigners serving for us for a long time.

In conclusion, STEM policies help high our tech industry grow, and also collaborate with H1B and green card policies to stop immigration waives while keep the foreigners working for us.

Considering the benefits for US citizens I stated above. I strongly agree to preserve STEM extension policies and even increase the extension period.

Thanks,
