I really support this proposed rule. This 24-month STEM OPT extension will not only benefit all the F1 students, but also bring lots of benefits to the U.S.

First of all, the development of America benefits a lot from diversity. This extension will encourage more talented international students in different majors to choose US instead of other countries. And they will be more likely to stay here to make contribution directly to US once they graduate with this extension.

Second, the current OPT has only 12 months, which is too short and unreasonable. Generally speaking, the new hire need time to be trained to be experienced and skillful and then they can have good impact in work. 12 months is absolutely not long enough for companies to wait for the good return from the new hire. The cost to train a new hire, not only in the terms of money, but also in terms of time, is so much. This may lead to that all the technology companies won't choose to hire new graduate. Thus, 12 months are equal to 0 month. Meanwhile, the limited human resources will slow down the innovation and development of those critical areas, thus slow down the whole development of US.

Moreover, if this rule is not approved, STEM OPT will short from 29 months to 12 months, which is a huge huge huge change. This will break the career plan of so many international employees, and also has really bad influence on the development of related companies. 

In a word, this 24 month extension is good and necessary. Why don't approve this win-win rule?
