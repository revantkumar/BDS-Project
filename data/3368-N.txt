I am opposed to implementation of the proposed regulations. The United States currently has more than a sufficent number of STEM graduates to fulfill the needs of employers in this country. These regulations mean that it is easier and cheaper for companies to "out source" American jobs to workers from foreign countries, rather than to hire American citizens. I think that it is disgraceful that the US Government is putting the interests of large corporations (who want cheap workers) over those of the American middle class.
