Skilled workers are the lifeblood of American supremacy. Attracting the most talented and skilled is what constitutes the greatness of our nation. Google, arguably the world's most technologically advanced company, is now led by once a foreign student, Sundar Pichai - an extremely talented individual born and raised in India. Just like each and every one of those who studies here, he brought to every American his diligence, intelligence and tenacity. Undoubtedly, Google's CEO is only of the ample exemplary foreign workers who have contributed the very best of their talent to America. Among others, Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft is yet another example. 
Had we not allowed foreign students to stay and work here, we would not have had the rejuvenating leadership for two of the world's pioneering companies with a combined market cap of 1 trillion dollars; had we not allowed foreign students to stay and work here, we would have sent the best talents of our generation back to countries like India and China which are destined to rival America's technological, economic, and political supremacy; had we not allowed foreign students to stay and work here, would some of the most research intensive industries have grown so much as to retain the American workers who they have been able to hire today?
Anti-immigration, specifically, anti-immigration for skilled workers is at best a dangerous and irrational impetuosity. Anyone overwhelmed by such a sentiment, should ask themselves - were YOUR families immigrants as well? Would the United States have prospered if you and many others like you had not moved, worked, and contributed to this country?
