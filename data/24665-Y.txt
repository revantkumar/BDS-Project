As a current international student. I strongly support the opt-extension. Students with those skills and knowledge have made and will continue make huge contribution to the country. They are not cheap labor as some people thought.There are thousands of STEM people working in the industry like IT company, they are brilliant and make US very advance in those field. Please image the consequence that the country will face because of the policy.
My second point is that a lot of the citizens right now have a ancestor once was an immigrant. I like the country because of its diversity. The opportunity means a lot to us and I believe it also means a lot to the country as well.
