I support this rule. Browsed over 10 pages of comments, I'm surprised to see how discrimination is still strongly rooted in some people's minds...You can tell that I'm a "foreigner" by my name, actually having been in the US for over 4 years as a PhD student, the best thing I've ever experienced in this country is equality. We, no matter where you from, are fortunately granted the opportunities to prove ourselves and contribute to the society.

Some argue that granting OPT extension is terrible as the international student can take over citizen's jobs, I bet they only judge a book by its cover and haven't really read the OPT rules of "e-verify" employer thoroughly, one of them being "the employer will not terminate, lay off, or furlough a U.S. worker as a result of providing the STEM OPT to the student". Thus, "e-Verify maximizes the reliability and ease of use of the system, while preventing unauthorized disclosure of personal information and unlawful discriminatory practices based on national origin or citizenship status." 

US has dominate the world in many aspects including technology, this is partially due to the fact that US provide a place for STEM workers from around the globe to cooperate. The funding spent in cultivating STEM students is huge, yet the only way to get returns is to let the trainees work for this country. 12 months are far from enough for students to fully unveil their capabilities, thus OPT extension, in contrast to bring up US citizen unemployment rate, is a must to keep tech companies competitive so as to create more job opportunities.

Therefore, I undoubtedly support OPT extension plan, not just for a chance to prove my capabilities, but also give back what I learned to contribute to the country where I gained my skills.
