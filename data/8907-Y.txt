In my opinion, this rule is good. This rule can increase the flow of students for higher education in US universities rather than choosing Canadian/Australian Universities. This rule helps the growth of colleges and economy. The idea of extending OPT from 17 months to 24 months is also good. This promotes a competitive work environment and helps in significant growth of economy.
