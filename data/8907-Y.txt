Zoe Zhang I came to the U.S 15 years ago. Back to 15 years ago, I was a young person who was motivated by the American dream. I was told that U.S was a land which accepts people from every where. As long as you are diligent, ambitious and hard-working, you'll be paid with what you want. I confirmed this was true by my own stories. I had many immigrant friends and they shared the common stories as me. They had decent jobs and they contributed to the society in terms of economies, diversity and culture. 
I felt truly sad when I saw so many people were criticizing giving STEM students opportunities to work in the U.S. They criticized that STEM students took the opportunities which belong to U.S citizens originally. I have to fight against this opinion. First off, even though many companies are welcoming foreign workers, U.S citizens still can find a job much easier than foreign workers. Secondly, not every international students can get a job. Only qualified international students will be considered. If they are qualified, I personally believe that we should give them chance to stay because comparing going back to their own countries, they've decided to stay and contribute their knowledge to the U.S. Thirdly, immigrants have contributed to our society to extreme. You can see huge contributions from immigrants from every side of the society. U.S is build on immigrants.
