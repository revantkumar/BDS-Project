Xingyu Chen I would definitely support this extension regulation! It is already very difficult for an international student to get a job after graduation due to visa status. It would be even more difficult without STEM extension. Many students would like to practice their skills immediately after graduation before they either go back to their home country or stay in the US. If STEM extension is no longer available, many high school graduates from foreign country will no longer risk their money and time to apply US institutions. From the perspective of US government, tuition fees from foreign students help with the construction of institutions, and the talent pool of foreign students is precious to the economic growth and diversity.
