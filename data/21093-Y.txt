It is harder to find and hire this talent from Master's graduates with computer science degrees. Their work authorization is a very long process lasting for months and needs a lot of expenses.

This should also be expanded to areas like Project management and not just computer science & math graduates because project management is evolving with Agile, Scrum processes which needs better skilled managers in technology companies.
