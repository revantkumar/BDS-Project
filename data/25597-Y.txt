I do not think at this time in this country while many citizens of countries that hate us should be allowed entrance to the United States.
We have far too many aliens here who have broken the law to get here. Until we get rid of the law breakers no one should be allowed in.
If we are hated so much why do they want to be here? They either want the help our citizens get or they want to cause trouble or both.
I vote no.
Send the muslims and Mecicans to their own countries and build a wall to stop them from coming back.
