As I can see, the OPT extension will benefit more talented students with STEM Degrees from all over the world and create greater value for the state. In my college, not too many students would choose STEM, which will lead to the lack of skilled and professional personnel in STEM area and this will do no good to the social development . I propose that the OPT extension policy should be implemented , in this way, mounts of companies will find the right one they want and make more money for themselves, which will in turn impel them to hire more native American people. So why not extend the OPT from 17 months to 24?
