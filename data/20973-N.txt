Why would we want to give foreigners opportunities when we have so many people out of work here? Government functionaries can say the unemployment rate is low, but the reason it's low is NO ONE COUNTS THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE GIVEN UP TRYING TO FIND A JOB. Why should businesses be rewarded for hiring foreigners? Is common sense dead in the U.S. government? Yes. When Uncle Sam taxes and taxes his own people, then turns around and rewards businesses for hiring foreigners, that is utter betrayal!
