I personally think this this expanding time (24 months) for STEM students is very important for both the students who study STEM as their major and for the future of the United States. 

For the STEM students, it's a great opportunity for them to gain more practical skills in real life situations rather than normal knowledge they learnt from universities. And these practical skills are really very important for their own future. With this kind experience, they could easily find another ideal job when they come back to their home country. And this is exactly the reason why they are coming to the USA to study rather than go to other countries like Canada, British or Japan and so on. These countries also have great universities in STEM field. It's OPT which attract foreign students coming to America from all over the world.

What's more, it's also good for US's economy. Because as far as I know, many students who study STEM are from China and India, you could seldom find native students study in any universities' school of engineering. But the field of STEM is very crucial for one country, especially for a country as powerful as the United States. The STEM students can work for your country for some extra time, do good to US's economy rather than do any harm to this country. So I really think let them stay longer to work for the US would be a wise decision. 

Thank you so much for reading my comments.
