I strongly support this proposal. It is unfair to deprive the international students' legal rights to work in the America, especially the students in the STEM majors who are making huge contributions to this country. Each year, OPT and H1B holders pay more than 25% tax to the federal and the state which are beneficial to the welfare of the American people. And there is nothing to do with the minimum wage. The wages for jobs of STEM major students with BS, MS and PHD degrees are far above the minimum wage. 

The OPT extension is reasonable and necessary for the H1B visa shortage situation. There are a lot of talented students who the employer want to keep and can't because of the limited number of H1B visa issued each year. The OPT extension will greatly relieve this shortage.
