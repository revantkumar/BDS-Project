Danning Zhang I sincerely support the extension of OPT for it will a)provide U.S. with more cheap labor force b) attract more international students to study in American universities c)guarantee international students more opportunities to interact with experts in certain fields

a) and b) increase profits earned by colleges and companies in this country. Americans will be beneficiaries ( I dare say the only group, because international students will not be included in the welfare system anyway) of the improved welfare system this economic growth creates.

As an international student ( I am not a science/engineering/math major) I also have the responsibility to talk about c). I believe that many students in developing countries have the ability to bring out groundbreaking analysis in science. They just need more time to communicate with those most famous mentors in the world. If U.S. gives them this chance, they may yield out theories/ products that benefit the whole human race.
