I support this proposal. This is 21st century now and the knowledge is increasing so fast in science and technology that we can only grasp a small portion of them. Each job in STEM requires unique knowledge. As a former Computer Science graduate student, I found that the knowledge learnt at school was out of date and the training opportunities were very valuable for my career and also for my company.
