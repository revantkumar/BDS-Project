I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. Because international students have historically made significant contributions to the United States. They paid a huge amount of tuition and other expenditures while living in the U.S. They also significantly enhancing academic discourse and cultural exchange on campuses. In addition to these benefits, STEM students contribute lots of research, innovation, and their knowledge and skills, which all help maintain and increase the economy growth of the U.S.
