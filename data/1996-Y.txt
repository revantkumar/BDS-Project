I highly support expanding OPT STEM extension. All international students should have the equal opportunity to work in US as long as they are qualified. Also, one year opt is not always long enough. New college graduates are usually more productive in their second year and third year in a company because they got familiar with their work and ramp up quickly. Therefore the extension of OPT STEM is benificiary to both international students and US companies.
