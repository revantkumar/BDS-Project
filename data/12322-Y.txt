Many of my F-1 status STEM majored friends including me, we paid much more effort to complete the goal than any other students. However, because of our foreign status, a lot of companies refuse to consider to provide the job to our group. Instead of having equal rights to compete with people who are citizen, we face lots challenge in workplace. The waiting to get response from companies takes very long time. Plus, 12 month is a really short period for gaining interview experience, technique skills, and get lots legal documents processes. Even for those people who find jobs within 12 month, if the training opportunity duration is too short, they will lose their jobs and opportunity to work in their ideal company. As a result, I think STEM Degrees students deserve a longer training opportunity after their graduation.
