It is not true that international students are willing to take lower pay than American students in order to stay here. There are not enough American STEM students to fill the jobs, and this is why companies are hiring international students too. It costs more to hire an international student - they will leave in a few years because of visa issues and because America is not their permanent home. The cost of re-hiring is high, but there simply are not enough people to fill the spots. 

The small business I previously worked at is having difficulty finding software developers and data scientists. The last person they have hired is a student on OPT work permission, and they really hope to keep him as long as they can. 

Anyone who has really gone through job search in STEM fields these days know that the hiring committees at most companies do not ask you how much you are expected to get paid before offering you a job. Also most of the time if you identify yourself as non-citizen, you are automatically considered a less desirable choice. The fact that companies still hire international students really means they have no better choices.
