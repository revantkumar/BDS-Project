I strongly support STEM opt extension program. Because it is not only benefit international STEM student but also for small business in the United States. For example, I am working in a startup company, which provides great cleaning validation service to pharmaceutical companies. But it's new and small, so it only can afford interns to come to our lab to do research work. Definitely, we get paid as other native American interns. We are not abused and we don't take working chance off anyone. In the future, my company definitely will have ability to provide more full time working opportunities to all, not only for international student. But if STEM extension is canceled, U.S. academic sector will lose its competitive globally. Less and Less STEM international student will come the United States. This kind of small business may can't grow as fast as it can. It's hard to keep same working opportunities for citizens as some people's expectation.
