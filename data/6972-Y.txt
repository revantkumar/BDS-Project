I believe improving and expanding the OPT policy for STEM majors will overall make a positive difference to the United State's economy and American people. I believe leading technology is one important factor that accelerate the economy of the United States, and by attracting more skilled, talented and selected immigrants from their countries to make contributions to the development of United State's leading technology and innovated research will help accelerate the economy thus make positive difference to American people's lives. 
In addition, with an accelerated development of United State's technology, I believe there will be more new technology branches and trends. This will make new job opportunities. 
Based on the above, I support expanding the OPT policy for STEM majors.
