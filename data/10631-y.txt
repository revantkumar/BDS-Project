Yaonan Zhong I strongly support the OPT extension! It's this country, United State, that benefits from this policy. International graduates were trained in US academic institutions, and they are contributing to the US economy in leading STEM fields. It is the important part that helps United States remain competitive globally. The STEM field has created more jobs than ever. 

Most negative comments here are very narrow-minded. Why would any Citizen against for the extension if he/she believes in his/her abilities, potential, skills and creativities? Every employer wants to employ the best students, regardless of citizen or non-citizen. Those negative comments assume that they are guaranteed to get a job even if themselves are less competitive. This is harmful to the development of US economy. A healthy economy will create more job opportunities. This is a win-win game for both citizens and international students. Citizens would work harder to become more competitive. And they have more advantages than international students, such as communication skills. One of the most important reasons international students choose US is that they believe US is a free and open-minded country. People here believe their American dreams that it's their abilities that give them good lives, not their citizenships. Let's work together to make US a even stronger country in the world.
