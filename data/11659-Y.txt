I strongly support this proposal for expanding the OPT extension for STEM majors students. There has been a great number of comments explaining the necessity before me so I would not repeat that but just quote some sentences from an award-winning US TV show of which episode's name is "Patriot Games": "This is a land where people of vastly different cultures are brought together by their willingness to work hard and their desires to succeed. This is a land made great by people standing up for what they believe. This is a beacon of freedom. Welcome to the United States of America!". The fact is that it's absolutely undeniable that since 200 years ago the USA has been established and developed based upon the efforts and contribution of immigrants from all over the world. So to those people who hate immigrants, please think about where your grand-grand-grand-grand parents came from. Why not having the highly skilled students help improve everyone's life quality in the US?
