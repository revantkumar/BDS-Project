I applaud the efforts put in to re formulate the STEP OPT rule extension. It would be a sigh of relief for all the international students who have lucubrated all those days to earn a degree from premier institutions in United States and then have contributed to the development of the society eventually by applying the knowledge what they have learnt. We are eagerly waiting for the result on the OPT extension. I like to be concise here. I take this opportunity to thank all those who have contributed an iota of their effort in getting this through.
