I really think its a good decision to extend the opt. 
1. Americans need international labors working the area like Mathmatics, Computer science, Medical which most of Americans are not good at.International students who work in the area will boost the industry of thoses area.
2. The Americian spirit is equality. So international students receive the education equally and work equally.
