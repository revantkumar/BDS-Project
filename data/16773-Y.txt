I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reason.
We learned here, we deserve a chance to work here for a while. This could benefit both of America and us. It's not fair that we have to leave soon just because we are not citizen. Everybody in America likes talking about fairness, now it's a great time to see if everyone really believes in it.
