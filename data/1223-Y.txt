Yue Chang Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees is much more beneficial for us citizens compared with its drawbacks. 

Just think about it. It cant be easier to understand that international students cannot compete with same qualified citizens in terms of getting hired. However, there are tons of positions in the society that cannot be fully filled by locals, especially in STEM field. And these students have been strictly limited to careers only related to their majors in college and only get little chance to win a working visa out of hundreds of thousands peers so generally they will not plunder job opportunity or whatever from citizens.

Conversely, these outstanding students who are able to survive through rounds of selections must be good enough to make contributions to our society and life. For STEM majors, theyre life changing fields which are closely related to humans. We do hope U.S. will still be the leading role in science and technology in the coming decades and thats why we need these smart brains to work for us rather than push them out and strengthen our competitors. Thats how States grew since World War 2, isnt it?
