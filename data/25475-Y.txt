There are too many of my acquaintances and offspring who are suffering the loss or diminution of their
work. The middle class is suffering. AFTER FOLLOWING THE RULES FOR A LIFETIME......WE ARE
BEING DISCARDED / SACRIFICED .....for some current international feel-good policy. 

Take CARE OF OUR CITIZENS.....We and our ANCESTORS BUILT the USA and now it is being
GIVEN AWAY.

Please THINK about the WHOLE PICTURE BEFORE YOU OPEN THIS FLOOD GATE!
