I do not agree with the extension. The extension of STEM OPT to 24 months will make the US person harder and harder to find a job especially with the slowing down of global economy. The extension of STEP OPT will worsen the rate of unemployment. The reasons are following. 
With the economy going down worldwide, a lot of US companies are conducting economy layoff and cutting jobs, for example, Google, Amazon, Ebay, Walmart, Caterpillar, Cummins and etc, which already worsen the rate of unemployment. If the STEM OPT is extended, it will make the situation worsen for US person. US person will be harder and harder to find jobs while still have to compete with international students. International student can always go back to their home countries and find more opportunities there. However, US person have nowhere else to go. As for the spirit of providing more training to students, international can also get more training in their own countries, and they already have enough training through course projects, research in the universities. There are a lot of excellent student are struggling looking for jobs, and they should be considered for job opportunities first. 
If STEM OPT is extended for another 24 months, international students will generally get THREE YEARS, which is way more than enough for the sack of TRAINING. 

Thanks.
