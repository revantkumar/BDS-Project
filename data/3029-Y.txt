This rule will benefit US education sector and technology sector in the long run. I look forward to this rule. 

I also saw comments about taking away jobs from US citizens. Come on, this country is founded and keep improved by immigrants. They make huge contributions particularly in science. STEM students probably is the most clever immigration group. Why not let them to stay?
