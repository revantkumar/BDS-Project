LI LI I totally agree with this extension policy. 
As an international student, we came across the Pacific Ocean to pursue a higher degree in the United States. Some people even spent more time to complete a Ph.D. here. However, after graduate, we faced a serious problem, which is the work authority. We spent efforts and money to study here, but we dont have enough time to use what we learned in this country. Extend the OPT means we have more time to improve ourselves, and gain as much industrial experiment as we can. This is tremendously helpful for our individual development.
