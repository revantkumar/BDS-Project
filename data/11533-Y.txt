I strongly support the 24 months OPT extension rule for international students.
If OPT extension is cancelled, less students will choose United States as first option. According a survey done by the number one national investigation center in China, 80% of students choose to study in US for its world-class education and 67% of students choose to study in US for the OPT rule after graduating. Since less students will choose US, the US academic sectors will loss a huge amount of excellent and talented young people from allover the world. With less creative students in US academic sectors, US academic sectors achieve less competitiveness globally. That would be huge impact on the competitiveness in the area of economy, science and technology. If students don't consider America the first and best place to contribute their knowledge and ability, how could the United State keep its advantage in the long role?

I can't agree with that US companies hire international student in order to pay less salary. Companies need creativity, technology, personal ability to make sure they always provide better products to consumers. To achieve this purpose, companies need people with highly educated skills and creativity. They DO NOT need people who only accept lower salary. 

International students who work for US companies pay taxes as well as any other US citizens. They contribute what they learnt in college to industries and high-tech companies, which makes sure US companies are always the leader in their areas. 

OPT extension for STEM students is a win-win policy for both US society and students themselves.
