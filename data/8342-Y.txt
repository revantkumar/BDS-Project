As an international student, I strongly support this rule because it not only benefits us, but also benefits the US citizens. Obviously, the extension benefits international students by providing them with the chance to apply what they've learn in school. The extension benefits the US by promoting the economics, introducing more opportunities to cooperate, and promoting the advancement in technologies.

On the other hand, extending the length of OPT will not threaten the job opportunities for US citizens, since most companies still love to hire native speakers, who share more cultural background. If an American has the same skills as an international student, I'm sure the company would more likely to hire the American. I actually feel that extending the length of OPT will bring more pressure to us because we will have a harder time finding jobs. But for those who have already started their internship, it will give them a chance to consolidate their knowledge in specific area. A 36-month internship will bring a moderate understanding of knowledge in related area, but not long enough to be an expert. So, I would think the length of 36-month of OPT is fair to both international students, in terms of getting enough practice, and Americans, in terms of protecting their job opportunities.

Overall, I don't think the extension will reduce the opportunities for US citizens. And it will contributes more to the US economics.
