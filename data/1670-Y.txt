I am a student from China, and I strongly support the new policy of expanding OPT time for these reasons.
1. From the experience of recent history of China,if a country want to be strong for a long time, it is very important for him to be open. Before 1900's,China had been always the strongest country all over the world.However,after 1900,the government closed the gate to the world.He didn't accept people from other countries and didn't send people to other countries for academic purpose.Then China fell.He was then defeated by many countries that had been weaker than him,even Japan.It took a long time for China to fight back for sovereign of the country.China has been developing very fast,as we all believe,since the publishing of REFORM AND OPENING-UP policy in 1980's. I think expanding the time of OPT is a sign that the United of States of America is going to be more open.This is a good policy that will definitely help America be even more stronger,where there are a lot of new countries challenging the position of America.Opening always means development.
2. There are a lot of voices that said expansion of OPT will cause more native people can't find jobs.This argument is very ridiculous.Why natives can't find jobs?Why they don't think about their own reasons?Foreign students always work hard in schools,so they may be more competitive.This is why OPT students find jobs.If you want to live in a developing society,you have to compete with others.Expelling others will not help the society to develop.The reason why many natives can't find jobs is because they don't study hard or work hard.They are NOT competitive.Living in a society should not be that easy that even not working hard,a person can still be rich.This is not reasonable.And if everyone in a society doesn't work hard,finding a job is easy for everyone,the society,the country has no hope to be competitive in international competition.So OPT students will cause not only contribute more power to push the societ
