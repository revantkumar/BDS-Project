I fully support this proposed rule. This is not only for the benefit of international students who want to work in the United States after graduate, but also for the benefit of America as a whole. With the expanding of OPT for F-1 students with STEM degrees, those international students can have a fair chance of finding a job and getting an H-1B work visa. We are not here to try to steal Americans jobs, we are just asking for a fair chance so we can contribute our knowledge, talents, and abilities to this great country.
Im not proposing that Americans should not worry about losing job opportunities; in fact, I believe this kind of concern is a good impetus for both Americans as well as international students to study and work even harder. This can only create better students and workers.
Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), these are supposed to be the fields with no national boundaries; our ultimate goals are to help humanities regardless of where are they from and to create a better world. For us, we want to work in America is because we believe that America is a land full of opportunities; the advanced technologies and high-level educations here can help us to achieve these ultimate goals.
