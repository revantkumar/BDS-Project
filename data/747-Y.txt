STEM students are really important to the US economy. I am living and working in Silicon Valley, many technology companies, like Google, Facebook, Apple, Uber, etc. have to hire F-1 students who studying STEM. If OPT extension is revoked, there will be a shortage of talents. STEM students are well educated, it will be a huge loss for the United States if they have to leave the country.
