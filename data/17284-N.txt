As an educator I feel that it is vital we do everything in our power to encourage American students to enter the STEM fields. We do not need more foreign students in these areas of study but, instead, need to support our own citizens in order to guarantee that this country will be capable of taking care of itself in the future. 
Instead of looking for foreigners, why don't we offer incentives to our own citizens and, in the process, raise our standards of education in this country from Kindergarten to college.
Do not allow more opportunities for foreigners to come into our country and take the opportunities away from our own citizens.
