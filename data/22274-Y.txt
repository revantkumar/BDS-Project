I strongly support the new program, and I am disagree with the comment submitted by CPO Willis Greene, USN Retired.

First, one of the biggest problems in the US tech industry today is that they could not find qualified skilled workers. Numerous studies and news reports have shown the need for more skilled workers in the STEM field. The expending of the OPT program will provide a relief for tech companies and allow them to contribute to the society.

Second, due to the need for skilled workers in the STEM field, the "downward pressure on wages" would not be an issue. The latest labor report on last Friday showed that the wage increase in the October was significant for the first time in months. Again, this report shows a huge demand for skilled workers from our employers.

Third, the top priorities of hiring for employers today is skill levels, productivity, and other job performance related factors. Employers will not hire international students because they "don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or prevailing wage". Taxes are never a criterion for most employers to think about when they hire skilled workers. 

Therefore, the comment submitted by CPO Willis Greene, USN Retired was not a valid standpoint.
