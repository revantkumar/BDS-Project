I do AGREE with the OPT extension proposal.

Some people might against the proposal for the decreasing opportunities for American students. However, according to NMSI, of the 15 Major Study categories, less than 20% of American students choose a STEM path. Besides, 26 industrialized nations whose high school students performed better than U.S. students in math in 2012. And 19 industrialized nations whose high school students performed better than U.S. students in science in 2012. All these statistics indicate that international students perform better in STEM major than American students, and the amount of American students in these major are lower than before.

With the high demands of fast growing industries in engineering and science, only hiring native students is not enough. And the extension of OPT provide the chance for industries and international students to fill up the gap. Therefore, I believe this proposal is overall beneficial.
