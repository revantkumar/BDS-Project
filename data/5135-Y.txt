This rule is beneficial for US universities, US corporations, international students and the overall US economy. Companies must take advantage of these skilled laborers here in the US for improving the US economy instead of outsourcing the work outside of US. It is in America's best interest to tap into this talent pool to continue leading in the tech world. Since they pay taxes like every US citizen, they help develop our economy. Great move!
