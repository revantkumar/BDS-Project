It would be a terrible idea to force the international talents to go back to their home countries, and that is EXACTLY the reason why we, the United States of America, is not growing as well as we could. By passing this proposal, we will retain not just these international talents, but more importantly their knowledge and skills, the very basis upon which we've built and developed our nation. Please support this proposal as we are also supporting ourselves!
