Stop taking jobs away from the true American people. Our graduates want work too. They try to pay for their own education and take it seriously. They need to work after graduation. Also those who are 50+ are now starting to loose their jobs because of age. Yet the social security now is starting at an older age. Our older people need that income to pay their bills. 
Don't you have any logic to what you are doing for this country. Grow up.
