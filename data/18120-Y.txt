The STEM students are usually smart and well educated. They bring brain powers to power this country. They fill the positions where highly trained skills are needed and meet the needs of companies whose needs might not be fully fulfilled by the limited number of native engineers, scientists, etc. The STEM students may take some job opportunities but in return they boom the economy, create more job opportunities, better the country and make it more competitive internationally.
