I strongly support the 24 months STEM extension rule.

Just think about one fact that how much percentage international students have occupied in the STEM related majors in any USA university, especially in graduate period. Without the OPT extension, the overall employment for american people will not increase so much, because the amount of american students majoring STEM are far from the need of industry, while numerous international students with STEM degree will find it hard to work in US, which will make a significantly negative effect on the high-tech companies, academic field and even the overall economy of USA. 

Actually, shortage of talents is happening in many well-established and emerging industry fields ranging from medicines, data analysis, cloud computing, 3D printing, energy storage and so forth. USA needs both american people and international STEM students to engage in these fields. 

Therefore, a 24 months STEM extension rule is necessary and much beneficial for the overall economy of USA.
