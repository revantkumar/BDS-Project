Why not help U.S. students have access to jobs instead of foreign students who will leave the country after using all of the benefits we have to offer. There are many workers not only college age but former full time who are unemployed and no longer looking because they have lost their job or been replaced by a worker from another country. we need to help our own workers first and foremost!
