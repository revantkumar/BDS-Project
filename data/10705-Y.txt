If the OPT extension is cancelled, most foreign students would only have one-year legal working time in the states (considering the high volume of people who apply for H1B and the lottery). With only one-year, it would be extremely hard to find employers who would be willing to take the risk of hiring you and also, even if F1 students are hired, after one year, when they finally get somehow familiar with business, they have to leave, and this leave has nothing to do with their working performances, but purely on the unkind policy. In this case, how would new foreign students want to come to the states for study? 
Besides, for now, I don't know exactly how many, but a significant percentage of hires are foreign students in many companies, not only in those big tech companies like Google, FB, LinkedIn, but also in other smaller scale (under 50 employees) companies. They could hire eligible STEM students, but once this regulation was disapproved, they may even have really unfortunate consequences such as short of people, lack of human resources supply, even shut down. 
The states is a place where migrants contribute, image if there was another Elon Musk, who graduated from US colleges and was ready to do something different, but he was evicted because he was not lucky enough to get H1B, and he had to stop everything that he worked for a year and went back home, started over. Won't this be a big loss to the country and even to human beings?
