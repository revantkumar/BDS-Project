I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. First of all, just take a look at the top colleges of engineering and natural science, you will see at least one third of them is not native American. I just want to give this example from my daily life to show how talents from different countries have contributed to the United States. 

The United States is strong because it allows people from different countries of different race to thrive and success. OPT extension gives the chance to keep talents in the country and contribute to crucial areas.

2. Most of the argument against this proposal says the OPT extension will make the job market more competitive for native American, but interestingly most people who make this comment has nothing to do with the job market that STEM student are in. 

STEM students fills the positions in high-tech companies, which have very high hiring bar and are always looking for talents. If native American could meet this hiring bar, there is no reason that companies would prefer STEM students, who are not native speakers and require sponsorship to keep working in the company. Therefore, STEM students do not impose any threat to native American in the same job market, and for those who are not in the same job market, why do you care?
