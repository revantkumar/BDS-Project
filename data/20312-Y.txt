I strongly supported this plan. 

1) This plan will benefit the international students, and very likely to attract more international students.

2) With more international students, it will increase local economy - housing, food and etc.

3) It also benefits US students as well. "As the number of international students on U.S. college campuses continues to grow, their American classmates who actively interact with them are not only learning about foreign cultures but also enhancing their own self-confidence, leadership, quantitative skills and other abilities long after they graduate, according to a new Duke University study of alumni from several universities."

4) It also benefits US companies. According to Jonathan Rothwell, US is "Short on STEM Talent" (http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/09/15/the-stem-worker-shortage-is-real). US companies need STEM talented students.
