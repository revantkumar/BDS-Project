Dr. Annie Sagebiel A Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand:

1. OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013
2. OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.

In these tough economic times America does not need a program like this to be started. Protect American workers now and do NOT start the OPT program. 

Our national security is also at peril. Per Senator Charles Grassley in letter to the President: "the report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'"

The bottom line is sensible immigration is pertinent to protect the American way of life. I employ you to oppose the OPT program.

Sincerely,
Dr. Annie Sagebiel
