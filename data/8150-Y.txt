If pass this regulation, U.S. employers will benefit from the increased ability to rely on the skills acquired by STEM OPT students while studying in the United States, as well as their knowledge of markets in their home countries. For example, Uber, Facebook and Google are trying to expand their market in countries where some of the students from, this regulation's pass will promote the speed for these companies.
