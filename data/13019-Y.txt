I support the OPT extension largely because int'l students shouldn't be discriminated against others on immigration status or working chances. Objectors may say int'l students may deprive natives of working opportunies, this argument is against the human right constitution. Besides, everybody is facing the same problems in career building, if you are afraid others may take your chances, then you need to become stronger to compete. Most important for me, 24 month extension is necessary for int'l students. A sudden call off due to failure in H1b lottery is a huge damage to both employers and employees, extension can greatly reduce the risk of losing employees or unnecessary staffing costs. Universities get many people,then immigration should make changes to digest these people in the long run. BTW, international students' lives are so frustrated that you cannot imagine any bright future- all of your dreams were caged by what's called immigration laws and you yourself is the caged beast inside. This is not fair for people living in this country who face discriminative laws every time they want to move forward. They deserve more chances to show their abilities. Don't make the laws more stupid.
