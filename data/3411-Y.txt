Support this rule. 
First, international student benefit not only the company who are hiring them. When they study during college, they pay tuition just like citizen. When they graduate and find a job, they pay taxes just like the citizen. And during the time they stay USA, they rent house, buy cars and everything they buy in USA will benefit the economy of USA.
Second, this rule only applies to STEM STUDENT. American citizen should not be afraid like they all will lose their jobs. Some American say they already have enough workless people. However, majority of these people could not be qualified for the STEM major's job. 
Third, competition is everywhere. American people should not act like OSTRICH. Just be avoid and overrule this kind of act could not solve the real problem. Just imagine that all foreigner student left USA, could the citizen support current USA's company and economy? Even there is no foreigner in a the job market, there will exist other kind of competition. I wonder people who are saying USA should not hire any foreigner people will ask for different kind of protective rule to protect them?

All in all, STEM will bring competition, but competition is not a bad thing. It will make USA economy continually grow and benefit not only citizen but also more people.
