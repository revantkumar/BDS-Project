I've heard many many great technicians left the US because of lacking of opportunity for applying demanding H1B visa. Under current structure, many talented international students can only have one or two chances for applying H1B, as the result, they were not able to contribute to USA after they benefited from the education system and academic resources.
I strongly believe that this 24 opt-extension will benefit both this society and international students.
