SUPPORT SUPPORT SUPPORT this rule.

I disregard those who oppose this because every reason u take it non-sense.
1. Opposers said this program support uneducated people to take job positions from US citizen. I would like to say if u can Google what OPT if before comment. OPT is set for highly educated person( at least guys with Bachelors degree ). If those people can be marked as 'uneducated', I believe I can hardly find educated people from the person I know.
2. Opposers said this program support people to get jobs beyond their major. I still would like to ask folks to check the rule first. If u don't do the jobs related to your major, u can't even get approved by USCIS. If u guys doubt this, are u saying USCIS keeps making mistakes for tens of years. The result should be ridiculous.
3. Opposers said this program ruin citizens to get a job. The purpose of using OPT is to training highly educated people with actual working experience. If u think this program itself is not right, then this is not the right place to discuss this. We are talking about whether we need to extend the time.
