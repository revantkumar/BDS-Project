I strongly support the new proposal to increase the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. This is definitely an important time for the students to utilize the education they have received. It will help the American economy do better if they allow highly skilled people to work in the country.

I do not think this has a negative effect on the American people as the STEM fields have very competitive requirements. In these fields, one doesn't get a job JUST because they are American/foreigner. Any American with the same skills should find it easy to find a job.
