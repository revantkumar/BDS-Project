I support the proposed rule with 3 reasons:
1. The extension would better fill the talent gap that many American companies need. As we all know that the economy has been rising since 2010 and the need for skilled talents is demanding. The international students with advanced abilities and talent skills would help companies upgrading their systems in aid to the rapid change in the international market, under a longer OPT period.
2. The extension of the OPT would be a very handy aid to the current criticised H1B visa system. The H1B visa system has been much criticised for failures in filling the talent gap and damaging the economy. The reform is needed and the extension of the OPT would be a aid at this moment.
3. The extension would attract more international students come to study in United States, which will bring the local economy up, provide mo;re funding to the universities, and help new technology development.
