I am an international student and I'm doing my PhD in STEM major in California.
I trained myself as an scientist as well as an entrepreneur. I respect what WATW - Washington Alliance of Technology Workers is concerned about. However, I'll still say that, we are not here to divide the cake.

We are here to make the cake bigger, and let everyone get a slice.

If U.S are driving us away, I'll say, I'll still be very successful in some where else, maybe in China!

Then, I'll be leading a group of Chinese hard working engineers competing with works in U.S for domestic/international market. 

Do you want one more ally in U.S, or one more competitor in China?
