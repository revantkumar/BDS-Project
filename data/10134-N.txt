I oppose the department of homeland security's proposed rules that would expand the optional practical training program. On the surface, it is only a rule that benefit the F1 students who eager to work in US.However, this proposal will have ripple effect upon everyone in the US. For the upper class, since they are the management of company, it is a pleasure for them to hire stem students because of the lower salary cost. On the other hand, both middle class and lower lass will struggle to find jobs,and compete with those stem students. As we know, the umployment rate of US is lower than before, but when this rule applied, it will be a disaster for umployment rate. Less jobs occupied by residents, and more people rely on umploment benefits. The result is government will spend more money on these benefits. They should pay for this proposed rule.
