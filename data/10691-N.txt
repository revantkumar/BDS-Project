The billions of dollars spent on this program should be diverted for use in programs that benefit American citizens. Data shows employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. What incentive do employers have to hire Americans when programs like this exist? It is the exact opposite method or program our government should have in place to benefit taxpayers and American citizens. In fact, the name of this program is a misnomer because there is nothing practical about benefiting foreign workers at the expense of Americans.
