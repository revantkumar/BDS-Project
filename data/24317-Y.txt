I supported this rule, from my prospect of view, i am felling that this proposed rule is good for both the united states and stem students. 
Here is my points:
The US wants be the most known country in the world, attracting international student is the best way to achieve that. if they can stay and work in the US by the benefit of opt and extension, the US would be the biggest beneficial owner, try to think which country do not want many intelligent people work for them? 
Nowadays too many American students wants to be CEO, lawer or work in the Wall Street, not many of them want to be an engineer, if you take a look at many big IT companies in Silicon Valley, foreigner are making the real contributions. Canceling opt extension is like teaching these intelligent people many skills, after one year tell them we don't need you any more, go back to build your own country and compete with the US. If in that case, the US would be the biggest loser. 
Many native American will say that we are "illegal immigrants", that is total wrong, we have the legal visa to work and study here, we are not competing with general American people for job, we only do engineering work which not a lot of American people wants to do!
