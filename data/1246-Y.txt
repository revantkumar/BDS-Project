I strongly support this rule because many international students with master's degrees, are highly qualified to work in best American based companies. Where the only intention of the students is to apply their educational skills to gain practical experience in the industry. This would benefit both the companies and the students. For many students, Reason for choosing United States over other countries is that United States gives best opportunities for the international students to practically apply their skills after their education, which would help them in future. If this rule is not there there would not be enough time for them to work in the industry and gain knowledge. Because of this I strongly and firmly support this rule.
The overwhelming weight of research shows that in our dynamic labor market, skilled immigrants complement their U.S.-born counterparts. Skilled immigrants' help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign workers positively impact the wages and employment opportunities of native-born workers across our economy.
