Looking around, America has not been no longer a foreign student's first choice any more. With high tuition and unstable work environment, why do students want to invest money to come to US instead of other countries. Australia, Canada, and european countries, especially Sweden, Germany, France, Finland, etc. They offer much better career guarantee when students graduate.

America has to make changes to make itself be on the edge of international competitions. And innovation has always been the key factor for America to succeed in history.

Therefore, I strongly support this proposal.
