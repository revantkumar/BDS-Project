Maggie Zhou I strongly support this proposed rule since this is a win-win strategy for both US and international students who is going to attain the STEM degree in USA. First of all, diversity is one of the most important thing. We should open our eyes and get interact with people from different background and learn from each other. Otherwise, there is no way to improve ourselves. Second, the new STEM graduates are not competing with the domestic students. Everyone is different. The jobs that are suitable for everyone is different. We just need to spend some time to find out what we really want and what we really are suitable for. Last but not least, the new STEM graduates will make a great contribution to US. In fact, a lot of very successful people who changed the world of US are international at the very beginning. What if they do not have the first chance to prove themselves? Maybe the US would be very different. In all, I strongly support this proposed rule.
