Jing Qian I strongly support the 24-month OPT extension policy and believe it is a win-win strategy for both US and international students who are studying and will obtain degrees in STEM majors. I want to dispute a negative comment I saw on the website. Somebody think foreign students take away jobs and do not pay tax. This is completely wrong. During their study in US, most international students pay tuition and support life expenses by themselves. They bring diversity into US universities and propose smart ideas in research. Lots of international students are employed in big technic and scientific companies offering high salary, which significantly contributes IRS tax income. Also, international students didn't take away jobs from US citizens, they make great contribution to the US society and even help in creating more open positions in this country.
