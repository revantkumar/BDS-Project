I strongly support this rule for the following reasons.
1)This rule will have a strong impact in attracting lot of high skilled international students to USA and this will in turn have a positive effect on the national economy.

2)As we all know that most of the skilled professionals in the STEM area are international students and this rule will help this international students to present their skills in USA and this in turn will help to build a strong STEM related job environment in USA.
