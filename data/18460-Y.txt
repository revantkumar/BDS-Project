I definitely support the OPT extension decision.

Nowadays lot of STEM related industries are supported by foreign workers. Most of them are high intelligence people and the GDP they produce is a really considerable. They are making the REAL contribution to US economy. I do not see any benefit if the silicon valley lose large amount of high quality talents because of meaningless exclusive opinion. We should try our best to keep those people, not pushing them out.
