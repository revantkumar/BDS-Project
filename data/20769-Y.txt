I strongly support the proposed rule. 
First, United States has a large shortage in high-tech workers, since the trend in United States is that less and less people are study in these majors, the situation is only going to get worse in the next few years. So it make sense to have the opt extension for STEM international students. 
Second, it is going to help US companies to face the tough competition from companies from other countries, thus these companies can contribute more in tax and provide more job opportunity in lots of different areas.
