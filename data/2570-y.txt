Shiyang Chen I strongly support this rule for the following reasons.
1. In America, everyone has equal chance. Hard working students who study in US deserve more time to practice what they have learned.
2. Actually hiring international students is good for US economy, especially in IT area.
3. We are not competing with Americans, we are making contributions to make US a better country.
