Comment :- Why only STEM students are being considered for extension of OPT period. I am surprised that why NON-STEM students are not being considered. They have also come here to make their future better and thereby contribute to USA. Please take into consideration NON-STEM students too. It would not be fair to not include NON-STEM students to extension because going back to the home country after not getting H1 is a huge setback for the student.
