Nicholas Henderson International students bring money, skills and jobs in USA. By 2017, the global middle class is projected to increase its spending on educational products and services by nearly 50% - from US$4.4 trillion in 2012 to US$6.2 trillion. Our country has reached on top of the world because of the technology and because of this rule actually the whole world is contributing towards the technological growth of our country. The U.S. Must Attract and Retain Global Talent to Stay Competitive. Hiring international students does not mean stealing jobs from Americans. I personally did not see ANY American students with STEM degrees and decent GPAs get unemployed.
