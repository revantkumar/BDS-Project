YES! I DO SUPPORT the OPT-extension.I firmly believe that it is necessary for our country. As we can see,over the years, foreign tech workers contributed tremendous growth to the US economy. If we lose this force, we would have a great loss which the foreign workers bring about. Currently its hard for an international workers stay in US only through the H1b. If without policies like OPT-extension, the tech companies can hardly hire enough talents in the stem field.In addition, It is RIDICULOUS to talk about the right of citizens over non-citizens.American spirits tell us that everyone born fairly and there shouldn't exist any discrimination.Therefore, DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN in this free country. APPROVE the OPT-extension.
