I feel this is good policy, for both of the STEM students and the employer. For example, there are more than thousands of STEM student in every big IT company, most of them works hard and contribute to their team a lot.
Also, it is more difficult for foreign students to get a job in US, because they need extra financial support from their employer, such as VISA and Immigration support. Most of them who can get hired in the end must be very excellent, their stay in US will absolutely be positive for the future of US economy.
