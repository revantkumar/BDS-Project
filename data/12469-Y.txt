This is a great idea - I wholeheartedly support regulation that increases the F1 OPT STEM study extension to support STEM graduates who want to stay in the US and contribute to our economy. These F1 students are highly skilled and will add to the US economy, driving innovation forward in this country vs. abroad. If we don't try to keep these students in the US after we educate them, someone else will benefit. Thank you!
