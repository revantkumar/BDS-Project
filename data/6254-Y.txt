I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:

1. The governmentshould let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S..

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. Image a world without diversity, what a disaster !

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. I think competition can help U.S. increase its strength in the world.
