I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and give them a chance to make contributions to the U.S. Especially for those STEM international students, we need their help to improve our economy.

2. It is also unfair to enforce the international students go back to their own country after their graduation. They paid the expensive tuition fees, and wish to do something for our country. 

3. Competition does exist, but I don't think it is a bad thing. Those international students always choose the careers which have more tough workloads, and less time to have a good rest. Actually those jobs are not that popular among our native people. Nobody prefer to do that if having any other better choices. Meanwhile, it is obvious we need international students to help with our economy recovery. 

4. Some of my friends are international students. Most of them are just willing to have working experiences in our country, not the immigration things. I believe we should give them this opportunity to have a try.
