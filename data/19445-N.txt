I find it highly disturbing that this administration continues to push for more imported labor. We have more then enough Americans willing to do those STEM jobs we keep hearing companies complain they can't find. 
This is all about cheap labor and nothing more. When companies like Microsoft can hire imported labor without having to pay Social Security, medicare ,and unemployment taxes this puts Americans at a disadvantage when competing for the job with a F-1 visa holder.
It's a crying shame our elected officials babble about creating high paying jobs in this country then import foreign labor to do those jobs at lower wages. From the President on down you've turned your back on the American worker. We hear your empty rhetoric and believe you're nothing but a bunch of two faced hypocritical corporate sellouts. 
The American people need to replace everyone of you elected officials in Washington who claim to represent us.
