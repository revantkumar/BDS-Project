I am in full support of this proposal for the following reasons:

1. US universities lead education and research in the world, and produce the most skilled STEM graduates. Looking at the statistics, a large portion of the students(higher than 50% in many graduate STEM programs) in STEM program are international students. Without a proper venue to retain these workers, it will undermine the competitive edge of US technologies in the long run.

2. OPT is not equivalent to immigration. A university diplomat might get recognized in a local area or within US, but might not be valid credential abroad. OPT extension will provide foreign students the opportunity to make contribution to US economy and to learn from experiences to start their own career in their home country.

3. Regarding the argument from others about "stealing" jobs from qualified citizens with lower wages, in this proposal, DHS putted together a set of actionable and systematic regulations that will curb these behaviors in the future(i.e. formal mentoring and training plans by employers, adding wage and other protections for STEM OPT students and U.S. workers, and allowing extensions only to students with degrees from accredited schools).

In conclusion, I think this proposal is well planned and definitely a position step to not only help relieve international STEM students from legal status burdens, but will also help US to continue attracting foreign talents and assert US technology dominance in the world.
