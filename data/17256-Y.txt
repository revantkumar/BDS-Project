I think 24-month OPT extension is good for everybody. For one thing, companies can keep well-trained and seasoned workers for longer time and have them contribute even more. For another, STEM students can experience more aspects of the industry, as from entry to senior level. Even further, US government could enjoy high productivity of STEM students and, once they go back to their home countries, spread the US working culture to the world.
