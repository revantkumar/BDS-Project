I do SUPPORT this proposed rule, mainly for the following three reasons.
Firstly, we do need the contribution of some international students in particular fields. Many international students are masters or PhDs with advanced expertise, instead of the "unlawful low-levellers". The proposed policy influences the job market for the STEM graduates with decent degrees deferred within U.S. If one happens to stay out of a job, and happens to be an American, - before making judgment - it might be more objective for one to consider the competency between him/herself and the counterparts with more cultivated education background that the American institution has nurtured. 
Secondly, the historical low unemployment requires to digest work forces to boost the economy. We don't need to bypass the fact that the U.S. might be at a great era ever since 2008, perhaps an unprecedented one in the course of reaching a peaked economy. Turning down and expelling work force with cutting edge expertise would be exceedingly disruptive both imminently and in the long run. And also where are the diversity and equality which this country values as declared by its founders?
Last but not least, unlike H1B workers, the STEM OPT based graduate employees pay the taxes just the same as the citizens, hypothetically they ARE willing to stay and contribute in longer term, they have already gone through the incredibly harsh lottery , and yet this is in disregard to fact that these graduates will find perfect niche any way elsewhere rendering tremendous loss of talents, considering the competitiveness sharpened from the colleges and universities in this country. 
In conclusion. I think it is a win-win strategy for both US and international students who attained or is going to attain STEM degree in US.
