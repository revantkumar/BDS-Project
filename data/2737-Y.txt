I believed America protect everyone's right equally and also give everyone equal opportunity to fight for their future. A US citizen and a foreigner should compete at same level, instead of having an advantage. Besides, with all different kinds of immigration issues, a US citizen already have an advantage during the job hunting process. About saying getting STEM student will lower the minimum payment, I don't believe so. The STEM student is a small portion of population in the industry, so I don't believe they will affect the minimum payment. Most of the STEM student worked in high-tech company, and their payment is higher than the average payment across the country. I worked in a big company in great Boston area, and our company pay people based on their level, capability and working years, not where they come from. All the STEM student work very harder because they know they need fight for their places in US. They pay same amount of taxes as US citizen. They behave very well and never cause trouble because they know they will lose a lot if they break the law. So I support the STEM 24 month extension.
