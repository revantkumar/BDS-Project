I strongly support this proposal. Firstly, STEM students who study and work in US will benefit a lot. Also, STEM students do not steal jobs from US citizens. They are doing hi-tech jobs which actually can't find appropriate local people to do it. Therefore, I think this proposal will benefit both the United States citizens and STEM students.
