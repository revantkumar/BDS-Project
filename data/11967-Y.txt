I strongly support STEM OPT Extension. International students studying in U.S universities are contributing a lot to the research, innovation, technological advancements which increases U.S economy in all means. Increasing STEM OPT extension period to 24 months encourages foreign students to contribute more to U.S economy by leveraging their skills obtained through their STEM degrees. By extending STEM OPT period, many talented International students will be motivated to pursue higher education from U.S universities which helps the universities to be globally competitive. If the rule is not implemented, many companies will be losing hundreds of thousands of STEM employees which impairs their growth and development. So, please implement this extension which helps the international students, U.S universities and technology sector.
