I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:
1. As a US permanent resident, I believe the new OPT extension policy will definitely make more international students come to the US for a better education which is also a great opportunity for the US to show the best educational resources to the people from different countries. Mean while, the increasing number of international students would also bring us more income and create more job opportunities in many areas.
2. For the international students, this new OPT extension rule will let them make contributions the US as well as develop their own careers which will absolutely benefit their future career when they go back to their own countries. With work experience in the US, these students would be more likely to have successful career and their stories would encourage more young people choosing to have education in the US. So, the STEM policy could build a beneficial cycle for both of the US and the students.
3. Some people may concern that international students will take more work opportunities from us. However, according to my experience, there are a lot of openings in the job market, especially in STEM related fields. Many companies havent found good candidate for some of their positions after posting their openings for a long time. This situation shows that the competition between international students and the US residents is not as fiercely as people imaging. The specializations of the international students will help many companies in the US to develop their businesses, which will promote others related companies businesses and may create more opportunities for the US citizens.
