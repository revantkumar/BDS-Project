This country is built by immigrants. Yet, the immigration policies are outdated and troublesome. 

I strongly support this proposed rule for the following reasons:
1. What the government should fix first is the H1B rule. American companies want to hire talented foreign students but the stupid cap limited the number of H1B visas every year. Many of the students are forced to leave the country because they are "unlucky" in the H1B lottery. That's miserable. Before you fix the H1B visa issue, this STEM extension is definitely needed for foreign students. 

2. If this proposed rule is denied and the H1B process keeps the same, young talented immigrants will go back to their own country. That's losses for United States and American companies.
