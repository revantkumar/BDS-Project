My question is -
* considering "A record 92,898,000 Americans 16 years and older did not participate in the labor force last month, according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics," and
* considering nearly half of all U.S. households receive some sort of government assistance, and
* considering THESE United States are collectively 18.5+ TRILLION dollars in debt,
- WHY are we wasting time, man-power, resources, and tax dollars on foreigners - and putting Americans in danger - without solving our own problems, first?
