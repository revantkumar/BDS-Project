Anonymous Anonymous I support the OPT STEM extension mainly on the grounds that it is one of the primary reasons why the United States attracts so many international students from around the world. Without the chance to work for a short duration in the United States, it becomes difficult to pay off student loans and hence students will no longer be able to arrive at the USA for studies.
International students contribute to the USA in multi-fold ways. Firstly, the amount spent by them in tuition fees and living expenses. Secondly they have a higher probability of being some of the smartest people in the world, thus increasing the US pride even in the short duration for which they work.
Thus, I support the OPT STEM extension and keep my fingers crossed for approval.
