Strong support.

Normal people might not have the basic stats knowledge but in general, the portion of talented and hardworking people in every race / country / region is pretty much the same. We only have this many people and to push the country forward we need more. With the development of high and modern knowledge the need is strong. We need smart people from India, China, and so on. 

What we need to do is not rejecting these people, but instead, kicking out all illegal immigrants. The tax you paid shouldn't be used to these people.
