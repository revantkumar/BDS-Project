I strongly support the extension of the OPT for eligible F1 students. These students are highly trained, tax paying, law abiding individuals who add value to American companies and play a strong role in developing the economy of the United States. It would be counter productive for the US to train and educate these students and force them out of the country so that they go back to their countries and develop the economies out there. In a globalized economy, it is in any country's best interest to attract highly skilled individuals and the US will only benefit if they allow these students to stay in the US.
