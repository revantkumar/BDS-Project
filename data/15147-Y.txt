1. This is a good way to attract high-quality international students to make contribution to the United States. Otherwise, talented international students will have other better options to study in other countries, e.g. Canada, UK etc. Many international student around me actually got many offers when applying for graduate school. And from what I heard, if the USA was unfriendly to international students, they would never come here for study. 

2. If there is no enough OPT extension, these students who have learned the advanced knowledge (especially technical stuff) will leave and make contribution for other countries. This will be a big loss for the United States. Besides, U.S. employers will benefit from the increased ability to rely on the skills acquired by STEM OPT students while studying in the United States, as well as their knowledge of markets in their home countries. For example, if Google, Facebook and Uber etc want to enter the China market, international students from China will be a big plus.

3. As I'm a Chinese STEM student and was born and living there, I would return back China eventually. Before then, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech industry development. If I have about 3 years work experience in US, I would be competitive in the job market of China. That's why this new OPT rule would benefit both US high-tech industry and international STEM talents. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion.
