Its important for students to be given extra time to work. International students spend a lot of money and work really hard in school and at work. Some of them have huge tuition loans and need to be able to work legally for more than a year which it would be if the present DC court policy stays. As it is, the students dont get enough time after graduating to look for a job. This puts added pressure on students and they have to look for jobs instead of concentrating on studies. A year of work is simply not good enough for students to get the work experience they need.
