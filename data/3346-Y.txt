I strongly support the opt extension. These days, technology is important to the development. Many students with f1 visa love technology like science and engineering. They have the ability to change an aspect of the life with their intelligence. As I met, many of them love staying in U.S. And make contribution to this free and lovely country. However, many of them can't do this not because thiy don't have the academic and intelligent abilities but because they don't have long enough legal time to work here. As a result, many companies don't want to hire them because of their short visa term. Then they have to go back to their country. So pity. In this way, U.S. Loses a lot of intelligent people to help improve the American society and these young people lose the opportunity of chasing dreams in this lovely countries. Please, give them an opportunity to work longer here so they will have higher chance to find their loving job. And this is also a good opportunity for US to speed up the development of the technology in this country. Please, give both of you a chance.
