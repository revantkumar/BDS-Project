I strongly support this regulation. Just imagine what would happen if the US sends the STEM students back to their home country -- these talented young people will make the companies in their country much more competitive and may beat down companies in the US, and then people will lose their jobs here. Therefore, giving the STEM students more time and chances to work in the US is a smart investment in the country's future.
