I strongly SUPPORT this proposal. The United States is built on hard working, not lazy people. Whoever qualified is deserved a job. No matter what's your nationality, if you are not qualified, you deserve no job. So it is not foreigners who take the American's job, it is the laziness. So you want to earn a job, work hard and stop complaining the companies hire someone better than you.
