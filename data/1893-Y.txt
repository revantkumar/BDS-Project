Steve Krauss I strongly support this policy. Keep and attract the talents and excellent people, especially high-technical people from worldwide to work in US is a good way to get US much stronger in the world for maining its leadership in the world. Since so many diverse talents from wordwide made their contrbituions to US for hundreds of years, US has become so powerful today.If the counrtry is stuffy and expels the talents just due to their nationalities , it is very stupid and the country will lose its capability to compete with the other countries like China and Russia as well as it will be dead very soon.
