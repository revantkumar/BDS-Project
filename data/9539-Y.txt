I strongly support the extension of OPT. 

Assume the values of U.S. citizens and international students are same for a company. If the company hired international students rather than U.S citizens, then it means this company are willing to cost more money to generate same value. Since the cost of hiring a international student is higher than hiring an U.S. citizen and don't forget we assume they are equally good. This is obviously wrong that so is willing to pay more money to buy a same thing.

So only the international students who are much better than U.S. citizens can be hired and I think no one will refuse to buy a Honda or Toyota car since they are not American car.

With the OPT extension, the companies can buy their "Japanese car". It's totally market law.
