I am also a International Student who landed in Land Of Opportunities for studying masters degree and get an practical training in USA which helps to improve our practical knowledge and as well to help this country also by doing jobs here which in terms gets taxes and also it creates many jobs to the citizens who live here as we spend money for living here basically when we dream to study masters here we also look in to the future of ours.

I strongly agree with new STEM 24 months extension because it helps us to gain more practical knowledge here and working here helps this country a lot rather going back to their own countries because we create more jobs here and spend our money here which in terms the economy of this country increases and as being a tech guys we give more competition to other countries those compete with USA this rules helps more international students to come and study in USA which would be a huge benefit to the country because doing masters in USA is little cost effective and students come here by taking educational loan in their home countries and for paying them it would be grateful if we work here 

According to me this rules not only helps students it helps to increases this country's pride and wealth as well
