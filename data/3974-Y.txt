Obviously the new rule is a win-win policy. OPT extension can definitely attract more talent international students to US and make the US more competitive in both high education and job markets. Most of the US companies are equal value regardless of your race and nationality, and the positions will be ready for any qualified people no matter whether you are citizens or not. If US citizens are afraid of competition from foreign students, why don't they make more efforts to improve their own competitiveness but object to the rules that allow international students to contribute to US industries? I definitely support the double-win policy!
