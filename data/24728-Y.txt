I agree with the proposal to extend the OPT. For the US to regain, or retain, relevance to global economy and technological competency, we must attract and retain talents from the world over. Many companies in the bay area, where I'm running a cloud computing service, find American grads' qualifications and competencies pale in comparison with those of international students from Japan, China, etc..., who are much more hard-working and law-abiding than any others with whom I have had the opportunity to work.
