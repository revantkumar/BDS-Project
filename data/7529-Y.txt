I think this proposed rule makes perfect sense. It benefits both american people and F1 students. 

First of all, US is somewhat short of human resources in science and high-tech fields. OPT extension for these talented students would elongate the time they serve in the US, which in turn would promote the high tech industries development, create economy growth, and keep the leading position of US in high tech.

Secondly, as the economy grows, it provides more job opportunities for US citizens as well.

What's more, this is a nonimmigration visa. Most F1 students just want to accumulate working experience in the US. Afterwards, they will go back to their home country. With 2-3 years of working experience in the US, it's much more easier for them to find a job in China.

To sum up, I think this is a proposal that helps F1 student and US citizen in both ways. I support this proposal warmly.
