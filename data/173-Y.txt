Xizi Cai As an international student, I decided to pursue my master's degree in Information Sciences at University of Tennessee because their program is STEM which could offer me the STEM OPT extension while some of other schools and countries could not!! To me this is definitely one of the biggest benefit that attracted me to come to the United States for my master's study. Now I am already in my OPT. It is unfair and makes no sense to me and those who have already committed to study in the United States, especially who have already in their OPT extension that the STEM OPT would be canceled! 

In addition, I think 12 months is just too short for me to gain good practical experience in my field. If I could have 3 years working experience in the United States which is the leader and bellweather in the Information Science field in the world, I would definitely have much better opportunities and be more competitive in my own country's job market. More importantly, one of the main reasons that my current employer (Tennessee Tech University Library) hired me is that they believe my skills and expertise will be an asset to them completing a upcoming project starting in 2016 (transferring from their current integrated library system to a whole new all-in-one system). If the OPT extension is no longer exist which means I must leave my current job in May 2016, not only I couldn't finish my job in that project, but they would be super disappointed since they have to spend more time and money to find people to fill in my position.
