I would like to strongly back up this STEM extension plan. 

Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies have employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010, according to the Partnership For A New American Economy. These corporations are also one of the largest groups that seek employments from OPT STEM. With only 12 month OPT, the current pool of H1B cannot hold the large group of tech employers in those big name companies. And these company cannot afford to lose the intelligence and will spend a whole lot TIME and MONEY to find alternatives, which is extremely detrimental to the company themselves, and then to the wall street, finally to the GDP of the United States.
