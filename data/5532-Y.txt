I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Higher education institutes took years to produce well trained and knowledgable people. THERE IS NO REASON TO LET THEM GO! No matter where they come from. This is ALL ABOUT ACCUMULATE RESOURCES AND FORCES for the country! Then OPT extension is the BEST choice since it uses the best out of those resources but it has nothing to do with green card and other "staying forever" regulations.

2. Competition is a virtuous cycle for all people at work and this country. We all know that once a person knows he/she is competing with another, he/she will show his/her best or try to improve him/herself more which means those positive competition improve employees qualifications. Moreover, International students only fill in few jobs which are not quite suitable for citizens which will not affect the employment for citizen students who graduate from school.

3. For lone term benefits, OPT extension should be kept because 29 months are a proper period for one person to contribute in one field, especially for those STEM courses students.

OPT EXTENSION is a wise choice for.both international students and the country. DONT LET IT GO.
