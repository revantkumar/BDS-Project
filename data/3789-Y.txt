This OPT extension must be strongly supported. The U.S. is the country that provides best education and equal opportunity so that everyone, no matter where he/she comes from, can fight for his/her life. This OPT is essential in the sense that it allows non-citizen graduates to have an opportunity to work, to practice their learning, and to make contributions to the U.S economy. One year OPT without extension would only provide less opportunity for qualified employee to do their job. In most cases, employee's career should be determined by his/her performance, not by citizenship. Having 24 month extension OPT will benefit both U.S. as a country that embraces many talented people and these people as employees who can make significant contributions to the country.
