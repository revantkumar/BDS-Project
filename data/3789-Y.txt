Weiwei Zheng As an international working in a US company, I'm firmly support OPT extension policy, not because it favors all the internationals, but also it does benefit US in so many ways. From a more practical perspective, extending OPT means we'll pay more tax during our stay and provide high quality services/products, in exchange of less payment; from long-term point of view, such policy will be an attractive tool to keep talented people to stay, particularly, high tech companies; a simple enough example is Albert Einstein, who fled to US after World War II, because it's a free country and welcome immigrants. I understand many US citizens are against this act; however, we are not take jobs from Americans, rather, we are creating opportunities and jobs to make this countries strong again; Orbeus, a company founded by internationals, now has collaborated with Google and AMD on human facial recognition work, who says they are not creating values for US? I just hope whoever leaves comments here could be a open mind and really learn about this whole thing, instead of being misleading by medias and so called "just" organizations.
