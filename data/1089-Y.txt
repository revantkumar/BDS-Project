I think it's a good propose since allowing Stem F-1 students to work in US can help with the economy. To be honest, there aren't many Americans studying in STEM field. If you send all these F-1 students back to their home country, the technology companies will suffer huge loss. It's a smart thing to do to allow F-1 students to stay in US.
