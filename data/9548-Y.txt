I strongly support this visionary proposal. Over years, along with the American citizens, international students/employees have contributed to the US economy and technology in keeping American in its leading position, so it is very important to continuing this.

To reply to some of the misleading comments:

OPT-STEM students are LEGAL employees.
OPT-STEM students have high degree (at least a MASTER degree), and they are not low wage employee.
There are already far less opportunities for international students because their immigration status, so it is unfair to say they are taking away jobs from US citizens, most companies have way more Americans than international graduates.
