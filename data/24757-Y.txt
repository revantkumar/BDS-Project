This new proposal is a good thing for companies who hire STEM students, actually.

It provides a sufficient time window for companies to check if they are talented enough and worth keeping. 1 years practical training is way too short, usually the STEM worker just start his work and his employer cannot see his value clean. However, in order to keep the companies work goes smoothly, the employer has to apply H1B for that worker in the first year of his employment. It is a little risky. If the person turns out to be a lazy or slow one later, the company wastes a couple thousands of dollars for that H1B. 

If OPT could be extended to 24 month, making totally three years, it will give employers more time to check the person then applies H1B for him in his second or even third year of employment.
