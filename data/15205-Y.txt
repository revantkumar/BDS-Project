I strongly support this proposal. Im an international student and Im currently looking for a job as Im graduating. My job search is not so smooth since for my major many companies dont hire international students and they will put on the job requirements that only local U.S. citizens will be considered. Although these companies are writing on their website that they dont discriminate against the race, nationality and gender of their applicants, the job requirements is in fact a discrimination for international applicants. So for local U.S. citizens I would say you guys have no reasons to go against this proposal as the job market will always lean toward local U.S. citizens and international job seekers are in some kind of dilemma due to their nationally and their visa status. Also for international students like me I need to work much harder that local students since they have families here and they have resources that I have no right to get a share. Sometimes they get scholarships and dont forget that universities take a large amount of tuition from international students before they give out these scholarships to U.S. students.
