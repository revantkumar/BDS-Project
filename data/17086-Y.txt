I strongly support this rule basing on the following reasons:
1st of all: OPT students PAY TAXES!!!!it is so unfair to see so many people running against rule even without knowing anything about this real situation. 
2nd, companies could move. Most of those huge companies already moved some departments abroad. The current question is just that, do you want them move more parts abroad? Currently it is not the case that "US workers comparing against foreign graduates". The case is, US comparing with other companies attracting big companies NO TO LEAVE. Sure, there would be less foreigners in industries after get this rule vacated, but there would be also less companies and less opportunities available in general. 
3rd, in general, economists hold the thought that allowing foreigners to work here is going to be good for the total economy environment. Not only for the macro part, but also for domestical workers themselves.
4th, this rule would increase the income in education field. Most universities are getting more income from foreign students because they pay much more than domestic students. Allowing this rule would makes the education in US more attractive to them. Note that, UK, Canada, and other countries are competing with US in this field.
5th, in long run there's return. Companies made more seriously decision when hiring foreign students and they normally give more return to the companies. 
Of course we should do more to not perform this rule incorrectly, but I believe the rule itself is trying to help everyone in this country in general.
