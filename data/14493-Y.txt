There is a severe shortage of dentist in the US and some estimates put it around 7300 more dentists needed. However DDS (doctor of dental surgery) isn't one of the degrees considered to be part of STEM the 1st of which stands for science. Not sure why that is the case. 

In addition to dentists there is a scarcity of doctors too. But none of these professional degrees are included in STEM.

Please add dentistry and other medical degrees in STEM classification. Currently medical students are eligible for just 1 year OPT and with all other STEM professions getting the benefit of OPT extension its not fair to foreign medical students.
