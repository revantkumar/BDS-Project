I strongly support this proposed rule since this is a win-win strategy for both US and STEM international students in US. Many US tech companies rely on international students to create values for their companies, which, in turn, bring more revenue and then be converted to tax for US. On the other way, for STEM students, this is a good chance to apply what they learned and gain more industry experience.

Many negative comment focus on two points: 1.they are really afraid that US citizens will lose their jobs in all the industries. 2. They think international students should be responsible for minimum wage.

For the first point, I don't think it makes sense. The simple but most directly evidence is the voice from the high-tech company. I have to say US tech companies definitely prefer US citizens over international students if they have the same skill set and capability, simply because they can work without any restrictions while international students need sponsor from those tech companies. What's more, there is also risking potential loss of international employees because of the H1B lottery system. So, why would they choose international employees if they have to face those troubles? International students is more talent than US students? Definitely not. It was just because US citizens cannot fill in the void in the US tech industry that makes tech companies need international student to work for them. 

As to the second point, International STEM students have nearly nothing to do with the minimum wage, simply because STEM students will work in high-tech industry, which also means highly paid. In fact, an international STEM student needs about 2-4 times the salary of the minimum pay, and the payment is usually far higher than this because they usually work on more competitive positions like software/hardware engineer.
