Kristen Glenn I strongly support this policy. The reasons are as follows:

1. The first year for new employees is usually to learn to be familiar with the working environment. When they start becoming familiar, they have to leave. It really wastes a company's resource to train new employees.

2. Our country needs diversities to stimulate innovation.
