I definitely support this proposal. It doesn't make sense to educate the students in US and then let them contribute to other countries. Offering the STEM students the opportunity of job training will boost the economic development of US. And they can also be more well trained and competitive after going back to their own countries. It's shortsighted to blame the hardness of seeking a job for Americans on the foreign students. Competitions bring improvement.Conservative leads to regression.The existence of international students will only make American students more hard working and competitive. It is unwise to simply keep the talent away from this country.
