I am an F1 student from Canada. I completed my PhD degree in Mechanical Engineering at MIT and I was recently granted the 17 month OPT extension. I very much appreciate the opportunity to have my post-graduation training extended as I feel this extension was a vital party of the education I received in the USA, and this extension has benefited myself professionally as well as my employer in the USA.

When I first completed my PhD thesis in the area of engineering design research, I aspired to continue my pursuit of academia and begin my OPT as a postdoctoral researcher at MIT. Over the course of the 12 months of my OPT, I have started to develop an interest in industry and wondered how I could use my education to design innovative products that will benefit people around the world. The United States is the most innovative country in the world and there is ample opportunity for me to find a product development position in world-class tech companies. I was able to find a position of hardware research engineer in a high-tech company in the Greater Boston Area. Because of the OPT extension, I now have the opportunity to learn from the best in the industry about the product design process, and further my education in ways that school work cannot have achieved. Meanwhile, my employer can also benefit from the knowledge I have gained from the world renowned university that I have attend while being an F1 student. 

Based on my personal experience, I believe the OPT STEM extension is an incredibly important and worthwhile portion of the F1 training in the USA, the additional months would allow students the possibility of exploring two different employment opportunities. Eliminating the extension would be detrimental to the quality of STEM training for international students, while also hurt the many innovative technology companies currently thriving in the United States of America.
