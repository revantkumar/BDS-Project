I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S.

2. The success of the U.S. is that U.S. accept the people from all of the world. For the international students, they can find the development point of the United States from the different direction due to the different culture.

3.We should focus on if the individual can develop for the United States or not. The United states is the most opening country in the world, why do we refuse the persons who own ability?
