John Lee As a senior manager in one of the most influential technology company in the Valley, I would advise that, if this proposal die, the valley will die. 

Every year we hire about 200 college students as our new software engineers. However, only less than 25% of them are native Americans. We do not have a discrimination over Native Americans. Our hiring process is fair, and this fair process led to a significant amount of foreign hires. This simply means that the foreign students are more qualified. 

Thus, please pass the proposal.
