Balasubramanian Gopalakrishnan I strongly support the new proposed F1-OPT STEM rule, since it will enable the STEM students in F1-OPT status for maintaining their status before they get the H1-B visa approval. Over the last few years, the number of people applying for H1-B lottery has increased significantly. As a result, the number of lottery attempts required before getting the H1-B has gone up. It will be highly beneficial, if they F1-OPT extension period was extended to 24 months so that all STEM students will get at least 3 H1-B lottery attempts thereby increasing the probability of getting H1-B.
