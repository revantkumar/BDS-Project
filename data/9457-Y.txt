I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.
2. International work experiences can enhance business tie with USA when I come back to my motherland country
3. Working or creating a startup in my OPT duration is highly likely to bring about more job opportunities to American.
