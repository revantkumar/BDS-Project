The proposed regulations are "irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 which found that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it."

It is a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'"

I urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program is secured and students could be located. I'm also asking that the Department swiftly move to implement the GAO's recommendations. I would like to know the status of each GAO recommendation, whether they have been fully implemented, and if not, why not."

OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.
