I strongly recommend the 24-month extension of opt for STEM student. First,H-1B visa is under a limit amount, if international graduates can have 24-month extension opt working in the U.S., they can get up to 3 years working experiences in the U.S . So they will worry about the H-1b visa impact.Second, 24-month extension will help the company to have long term employees, which will ensure the company's benefits. Third, this propose would help ensure that the nation's colleges and universities remain globally competitive in attracting international STEM students to study and lawfully remain in the United States.
