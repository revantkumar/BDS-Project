I strongly support this new STEM OPT rule, I see some Americans here complaining about :
1.)They object to any program that places foreign persons over US Citizens in the job market
2.)OPT denied American workers -- POINTLESS
3.)I hear that Homeland Security is proposing a program that will add opportunity to illegals
Truth:
1.) No student on OPT program is given a higher priority than any American Citizen looking for a job.
2.) OPT didn't deny American workers, anyone can get a job in US if he/she met the skillset needed
3.) Its called as F1 Student VISA , I say that again F1 STUDENT VISA , Its heartbreaking to hear someone say us as ILLEGALS!!!!! Afterall the effort and pressure a student goes in during the RESEARCH/THESIS this is the stick that we get? This sounds more of a comment coming from a REDNECK,
