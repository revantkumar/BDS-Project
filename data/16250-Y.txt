I fully support this proposal due to many advantages it will provide to the US. Many International students are talent and creative that they will bring significant benefits to the US. They will create new technologies that keep the US NO 1 country in the world. They bring more working opportunities for local people by developing their business. As a fact that the US is lack of skilled employees in many fields, specially in STEM. I look forward to seeing its passing!
