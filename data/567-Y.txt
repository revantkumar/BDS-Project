I strongly support expanding training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees.
Firstly, skilled international students with high level of education usually achieve great success both in industry and academia. The US government has put large amount of educational resources on international students and should allow them to make contribution to the US economy.
Secondly, diversity and equality are American core values. We should embrace differences and welcome international students with American dream to be part of our society.
