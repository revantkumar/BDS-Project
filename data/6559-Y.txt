Weitao Dong I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

Obviously, canceling OPT extension will lead to an enormous economy loss for U.S in the next several years. For Information Industry, a lot of engineers come from those students who are not native or green card holders, without appropriate OPT extension for those work here, they have to go back to their home countries, which will result in the lack of fresh power of U.S IT industry. 

Many foreign it student will not study in U.S. because that they can not gain enough work experience after they graduated. If they study in U.S. they will pay the tuition and spend money on life. All of this will get the economy grow. 

Besides, we strongly believe that the OPT STEM extension opportunity will create more job opportunities for our local people. International students are seeking for scientist and engineering positions, but they are not going to always stay in these companies.They want to start their own business in the US, and hire local people. No one doubts that the United States is the best place to start your business, and now is the best time, than ever. 

In summary, we should definitely support the improving and expanding of the training opportunities of international students. It will make U.S.A. economy growing faster. So I strongly support this proposal.
