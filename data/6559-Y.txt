A great proposal. By doing so our country can attract more foreign students coming to America pursing a degree, and consequently support our scientific researches both financially and technically. If we lose this advantage, what advantage do we have in comparison with universities in other countries like England and Australia? 
Meanwhile, by having increasing amount of foreign students, local economy will be boosted and further generating more job opportunities for jobless. Foreign students will not detriment job market in America since people with highly specialised skill are always in short. Those people without any skill and being incredibly lazy are the ones to be blamed for America's unemployment rate.
It would also be a great lose of government's integrity if this policy being cancelled while many foreign students still studying here. It's unreasonable to do that without an earlier notification.
