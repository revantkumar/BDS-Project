I strongly support this rule. We international students have spent huge amounts for tuition fees which inturn has benefited US economy. After all these investments, we should atleast be allowed to work for a few years to get the benefit of pursuing higher education in US. Moreover, we pay huge taxes once we start working on OPT which includes medicare and social security taxes which we won't even use as most of us return back to our country after working for a few years in US.
