I strongly support the 24 month OPT extension. I came from China and I got my PhD degree in electrical engineering and master degree in applied math early this year and I'm currently on my OPT. I'm currently a postdoc and I'm looking for academic jobs. 

In past years, US academic institutes attracted lots of talented non-US researchers who were more than willing to stay in this suitable working environment other than most places in the world. However, nowadays the academic job market is rapidly growing worldwide; Europe, India, China etc. are providing more and more competitive academic job opportunities, some of them looks too good to reject. For example, my university often circulates job postings from top Chinese universities looking for fresh PhD and postdocs and offering better salaries than the US universities. On the other hand, the US institute recruiting process usually takes more than one year; even you got a job offer promise this year, you probably need to wait for the next year to start. Based on these situations, many of my friends would choose to work in China after graduation as 1) the one year OPT is not sufficiently long; 2) the US markets may not be as competitive to other countries as before. 

Therefore, a 24 month OPT extension would provide more opportunities for those talented researchers who want to seek a job in US but concerns about their immigration status.
