Tiny Yue As an Electrical Engineer, I have studied and worked in America for almost 4 years.
Last year I got my first job in America and trying to get my H1b through that job, however I didn't got my visa from that lottery.

Without OPT STEM extension program, I will only have 4 months left. My company has used almost 6 month to train me and when I'm just ready to make more profit for the company, I suddenly lose the ability to work in America.

I studied hard as a student to achieve my master's degree, work hard to prove my own ability and make more profit for company. Before I came to America, I admire the core value of the America: equal and freedom. I believe America will love to give opportunity to the one who deserve it.

The 24 month OPT extension is crucial for all international student, American company and American economic.
