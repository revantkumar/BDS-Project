I oppose any increase in importing and funding training programs for immigrants (legal or illegal) until all our unemployed workers, college graduates seeking jobs, those newly seeking jobs have been hired such as veterans. The niche of creating new rules to hire more immigrants rather than Americans is wrong, counterproductive to our economy and a flimsy screen for the administration to import more foreign workers so more Americans are displaced from the workforce. It is also an opportunity to import terrorists and Islamists.

The goal is not to see how immigrants can be imported and employed. The goal should be to energize the employment opportunities for our legal citizens.

The Chamber Commerce is wrong in saying we need to import more immigrants. They pay them less because they are worth less. They go under the radar and increase their stay after their visas have expired. Is the Chamber of Commerce getting paid by the administration's rules for part of their foreign workers' salaries? If so, this is shameful, needs to be identified and reversed.

This administration stays up at night thinking of ways to go against the American dream all those who want to work. I oppose anything that blocks our Americans from taking jobs. This is one of them.
