It is ridiculous to expand job opportunities for foreign students when Americans with the same credentials are passed over. The big winners are the corporations that prefer the cheaper and more pliant foreigners. The situation is the student version of H-1B workers. America does NOT need to import workers. There are no jobs Americans won't do; there are only jobs they won't do for the paltry wages business prefers to pay. This would be another form of corporate welfare.
