To who may concern:
As a subsea engineering graduate student of University of Houston, I Strongly support to improve and expand training opportunities for F1 Students.
U.S offers the one of the best education opportunity in the world, and the practical training is a very important part of the best education. Students could have a better understanding of the knowledge which they learn in college and they know how to use it to improve the life and to change the world during their training opportunities. And the goal of education is to help students to learn knowledge and to know how to use the knowledge. If the OPT only has one year,students may not have enough time to totally know how to apply the knowledge into the relative field. So I think it is very necessary and important to improve and expand the OPT in order to achieve the goal of education to enhance the position of U.S in education field.

Besides, most of the F1 students are excellent in their major, such as subsea engineering. Almost 90% of full time subsea engineering students are international students and 80% of them can get A in subsea engineering courses. These talent people may be important to U.S. Because most employers would like to hire talent people and these people could do a better job to improve the competitiveness. Thus,improving and expanding OPT would be a good news for employers. Also, if every company can hire the talent employee, they can contribute more to the economy of U.S. 

Improving and expanding OPT is very important for F1 students. Also it is very beneficial to U.S. Please give more opportunities for all F1 student to contribute more.
