Bo Wang I strongly support the OPT extension for F-1 non-immigrant students with STEM degrees and cap-gap relief for all eligible F-1 students.

First of all, United States is historically an immigration country that embrace immigrants from all countries. The immigrants bring diverse cultures that makes America strong, unique, and beautiful. 

Second, United States has invested thousands of dollars and resources in many F-1 graduate students in the United States. They are highly educated work force that will contribute greatly to the healthy growth of many U.S. companies. Once the company grows fast, it will bring even many more jobs for U.S. citizens in return. They should not be short-sighted in this regard.

Third, the belief in free market is the foundation of U.S. society. Companies knows what is the best interests for themselves. The government should provide more options for the companies, and they will make the best decision on their behalf.

Fourth, STEM students are the backbone of this society. It will bring many more start-up companies, more innovations, and other opportunities.

Fifth, the students who need OPT extension for STEM students usually work as internship and co-op position, so they won't compete for the full-time job with U.S. citizens.

Lastly, the work visa lottery system is broken right now. The provided quota is much lower than the number of applicants. The OPT extension plays critical role to give the STEM students more opportunities to join the lottery in multiple years if they did not get selected in the first year. 

Overall, I believe the OPT extension is necessary and essential for U.S. companies to hire strong work force and compete globally in the next decades. The government should not see the excellent STEM students as enemy. Instead, these students bring talents to the U.S. society.
