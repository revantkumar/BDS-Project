We all know what technology industries mean to the US's economy, and what international students with STEM degrees mean to tech companies. In recent years, since H-1B visa has the cap, more and more international students rely on OPT before approved for a H-1B visa. A longer OPT period makes a larger chance to get a work visa, and hence a larger chance to contribute to this country's economy. That said, I support to prolong OPT extension period.
