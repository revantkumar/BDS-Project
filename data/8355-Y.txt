The United State is a leading country in the world in technology. Other countries also want to compete in this area with the US. Competition in grabing people will intensify. Offering longer time for such students to have the opportunity to be employed in US companies will enhance the leading edge of the country. Besides, what makes the US a great country is its openness and spirit to face challenges.
