Ravi Teja Tella It helps the students to get accustomed to the world wide market.This rule will indirectly help the U.S economy by attracting more and more students. This also helps the U.S market to retain the skillful students. 
The statement given by Obama also helps us understand the advantage of extending the OPT.
Mark Zuckerberg also stated that the US market will be in vain if all the OPT students move out of U.S immediately after the studies. Based on all this, I wholeheartedly support the proposed rule and hope it comes to effect as soon as possible.
