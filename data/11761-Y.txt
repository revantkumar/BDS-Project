I agree with international student need to have more time to fit in the US market, so they have more opportunity to show their best ability in their work area. I am a international student and my major is 3D animation. I'm working on my short animation film and planing to apply for the animation awards, which means from apply till the winners announced, it gonna spend almost one year, and we spend more than three years on this excellent animation. In the one year OPT, we may don't have enough time to wait till get the ranking and take the amazing animation work and good ranking to show more company. The new improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees and CAP CAP relief for all eligible F1 student gonna really help us to get more time to show our amazing hard work and to get the chance to do something for the development of US animation industry, also bring the different originality in this field.
