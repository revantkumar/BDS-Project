I support this opt stem extension. Just imagine if this rule doesn't pass, hundreds of high-tech companies will immediately go down and suffer in the long run. Statistic number shows the science and technology development are highly depended on high-tech immigrations. Without them, Silicon valley won't be able to hire the people they need to create innovations. That's why I support this rule.
