First, The U.S. job market is not a "zero-sum game" in which workers must fight each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has the most dynamic and powerful economy the world has ever known, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked shoulder to shoulder with native-born workers to build it. The overwhelming weight of research shows that in America's dynamic labor market, skilled immigrants complement their U.S.-born counterparts. Skilled immigrants' help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign workers positively impact the wages and employment opportunities of native-born workers across America's economy.

Second, one of the most important reason why America is the most powerful country is that America has led the world in science and technology for half a century. In particular, many of the high-tech workers come from foreign countries. For example, statistics from "The Contributions of High-Skilled Immigrants by Neeraj Kaushal and Michael Fix show that 22.3% workers are immigrants(note that this record is from 2009 investigation), and Chemistry 24.8%, Medical Science 44.4% and so on. No doubt that skilled immigrants contribute a large percentage of technology area which leads to today's Americas status in the world.

It means more positions require high level education and related experience will be available. F1 Non-immigrant Student can make up this shortage
