As far as I know, F-1 students work harder and try to make the best of their time to make profit for the company. Because they know they have limited time to learn, to improve themselves, so the more time they can spend on the work, more progress they can make to improve the overall work efficiency thus to help the company to be better.

The reason why I want to pursue my master degree in United States is I can have the chance to work here, based on my international background, I can think more thoroughly, I work hard, and I want to impress my coworkers and make them believe that I'm outstanding. All in all, I want to contribute my skills and my knowledge to the company, and it's really a win-win situation if I can have more time to work here.
