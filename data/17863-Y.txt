I strongly support this proposal, The US government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. For my perspective, recently, U.S need such STEM students to help to improve their technology and to improve the US competition with other countries, if more and more talented people are send back home, they will bring back good knowledge, good idea, most the talented people can not make contribution to US. and that is not good for US. And there are so many examples that foreign people make huge contribution to US. US is a country that will accept difference, that attract so many talented people to come to US, so, do not close that door for the talented people.
