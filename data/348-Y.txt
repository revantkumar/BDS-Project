I believe those who can get a job in a foreign country are brilliant and brave. It is already hard for them to prove themselves using foreign language, but they won't give up and try to blend in the society which they admire because it is a country of freedom and equity. If anyone is worried about competition in job market and try to get rid of those who are competitive using their weakness as a foreigner then I guess it is not a smart move for a country like America, a open minded and tolerant country, to close the door for growing faster while seeing some developing countries are developing with a much faster speed just for protection. Jane you refuse a talented person, you are not only lose a opportunity of innovation but also losing trust in people and fewer and fewer foreign talented people who believe they can find fairness in the States and less International students to stimulate economic growth.
