Foreign students helped tech industry flourish in the United States. However, it is only fair for all foreign student to be treated equal. I am against raise the opt period for STEM majors to reflect the need of a few trade group. OPT period should be 12 month for all students or 36 month for all students. How do we know that a certain majors of foreign students going to make more contribution to our overall economy. We should treat all foreign student equally.
