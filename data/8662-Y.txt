Yibo Cui YES! I DO SUPPORT the opt-extension and I do believe OPT-extension it is necessary for America 

First and foremost, tech industrial has been increasingly important to not only the USA, but American citizens as well. There are more than 100,000 software and IT services companies in the USA. Without doubt, America has been leading the information technology revolution for the past decades. However, no one can deny that the rest of the world is catching up by devoting millions of funds and manpower. Technology companies in the USA have been challenged more than ever nowadays. We need to make sure that we are going to lead this tech wave by providing the best environment for our industry.

But what makes technology companies stand out among tons of other companies? Talents. NO company should hire people based on their race, sexuality or citizenship. A company should always hire people based on talent, experience and passion. 

As is known to all that majority of technology companies are blessed with foreign talents with opt visa. They graduated from college in USA and now contribute their talent and time for American IT revolution and development. Not only they deserve to be treated better, but also they are truly needed from America.

In conclusion, America is one of the greatest countries but it is facing more and more challenges from the world. We need talents, no matter where he/she comes from, to help us make America better. All roads lead to Rome, but only one way to built Rome. I believe requiring people with talent is the way to built America and opt-extension is the path that we need.
