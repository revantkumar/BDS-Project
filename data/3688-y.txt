Yaoliang Hu I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed 24 Months STEM OPT Extension rule.

I Love contributing to Innovation and American Economy. I love the proposed STEM OPT Extension Rule. I strongly support the proposed 24 months STEM OPT Extension Rule.

As an International student and STEM graduate, I like to see this rule published and implemented without adversely affecting the 1000's of Highly Skilled and Highly Motivated students in F-1 status who are contributing to U.S. Innovation, scientific discovery, technology improvements and U.S. economy. It is not only to help international students to get more experience, but also helps America economy increasing when each year some many international students pursue master degree in USA. Also, please understand well that the new rules are only affected to the E-verify company but not all of the companies, which will not affect american to find a job at all.
