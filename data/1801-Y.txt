As a former STEM student, I strongly AGREE with the expanding plan. 
This program won't hurt the domestic labor market. First, I worked for almost 2 years in a US company, and I never got underpaid due to my immigration status. Therefore, it is not reasonable to say that employers prefer to hire F-1 student other than US citizen so that they can pay less.
Second, during the time I work there, I helped the team to get more profit for the company so that they would like to expand the team. The outcome is the company needs more labors and they hired more, both domestic and international. Thus, I would say this is a win-win situation. In addition, I left US and went back to my own country now after the STEM OPT extension, and I know lots of international students did and will do so. It means the job opportunity will always be there for domestic labors to apply for, as long as they have the required skills. 
Last but not least, the expanding of OPT will let talent students work for US, although it will be some competition, yet people will try to improve themselves under pressure to be better fit the job market. In this way, the United States will be better and better.
