I OPPOSE the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.

I was in the IT field but was displaced when a private equity firm bought out the business and brought in foreigners to do IT jobs. Many of my IT colleagues lost their jobs too and actually had to TRAIN THEIR REPLACEMENTS WHO CAME FROM INDIA. 

This is not good for America!!!!!
