The OPT STEM Extension is very important to me and the company that I currently work for especially when there is the H1B lottery. I am a PhD in Hydraulic Engineering. I have worked as an advanced development engineer at a Hydraulic company for a year using my OPT. The R&D level of my company have been improved greatly thanks to my effort.Therefore, the new 24 months OPT STEM will be a good cushion for me to keep making contribution to my company.If my company loses me at this stage, many innovations and development may have to cease. This US company may stop its step to become a great hydraulic industry.
