As an owner of a small LLC company, I strongly agree with the OPT STEM extension. I have experience of hiring several OPT STEM students as my interns besides local interns, and they performed all very well. In addition, they gave me a lot of ideas of combining different cultures and help me to improve my product market. I believe that the US is always open to all the people who have ability to stand. That is what "American Dream" mean, isn't it?
