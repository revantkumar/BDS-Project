I support the 24-month OPT extension for STEM students! It is the only wise decision to make for the sake of the US and the whole world!

Any technology breakthroughs depends on talents graduated from first-class universities, and most of the best schools are in the US. Have you been to the campus of those schools? At least more than half of them, especially graduate students, are international students! They have what it takes to make a better future for the US, what they need is just a chance! 

You don't just keep the doors wide open for them to get the education and shut the doors in their face when they're ready to make contribution -- it's unfair for the students, and such a lose for the US!!!!! 

Please treat us equally, the land of dream, the land of justice!!!!
