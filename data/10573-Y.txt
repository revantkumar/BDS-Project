Sanjay Thapa I support the OPT extension with STEM degree F-1 students as many U.S based companies are heavily dependent on these foreign students as part time or full time employees. With their knowhow earned from U.S universities, they can perform the quality work. Lets take an example of Sundar Pichai, a Nonimmigrant student, is currently Google CEO. So, having earned degree from U.S university, they deserve an opportunity to work here for as long as they want.
