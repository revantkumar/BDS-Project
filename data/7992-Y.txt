As a current master student in STEM, I fully support this amendment proposal, not only for my benifits but more for benifits for all STEM major graduates who are currently using their OPT and OPT extension and who are applying for OPT. For many training programs in US companies, the length usually varies from 2-3 years. Without enough extension time for OPT, STEM graduates couldn't complete the training program. On the other hand, high technology companies will probably not considering international students when they're recruiting. From my own perspective, a 24 month extension will definitely be a huge attraction for me to decide staying in the states and working for a couple of years but not going back to my home country as soon as I graduate. I believe this amendment proposal will bring good outcomes for both the US high tech industry and economies as well as give F1 STEM students a better reason to continue working. This amendment proposal is well written, reasonable, and fulfill the needs for the majority.
