I am certainly supportive of the extension.
1. America needs diversity, which has been proved to be a blessing in many ways.
2. America need technical talents. There is no point that America uses a lot of resources to educate a young talent and send him to other countries.
3. These talented people will be able to make contributions to the industry and create job opportunities for American.
4. Have these talents compete with American in job market will actually stimulate American job seekers work harder and better prepare tbemselves for the job
