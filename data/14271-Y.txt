I definitely want to extend the OPT for STEM degrees students to 24 months!!!As some of the students come back to their country without sufficient working experience,they have no advantage against those who go to work directly without studying in America.it constraints the development of students graduating from American universities so that there will be doubt casting on the education quality of American universities.the strongest country should give foreign students more opportunities to develop themselves otherwise it fails to be the most greatest country in the world.
