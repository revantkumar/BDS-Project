I strongly root for STEM extension for the following reasons:
1. Equity is American spirit, it's meaningful for U.S. government give F-1 non-immigrant students an equal chance to work in U.S. Those international students graduated from U.S. education system, they earn more than just 1-year OPT. They want to use their knowledge to make contribution to society why stop them?
2. The most effective way to prosper in short time for a company is to hire smart and talented people. F-1 non-immigrant or not has nothing to do with that! No company want to push away a talent just because he/she is not american. With these new policy, high tech companies could hire more talented students, develop faster, more profits, more GDP, more contribution to U.S.
3. It's a friendly signal for U.S. education organisations to the world. Come to study in U.S., and you could earn your chance to work here as long as you are talents. STEM extension make that more convincing.
