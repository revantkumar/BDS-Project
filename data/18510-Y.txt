I definitely support STEM OPT extension. This will provide the students to get exposed to the real world working culture and will help them gain real time knowledge. Some problems in IT can be solved with the wide availability of these well educated and fresh graduates. The Billion dollar industries has more advantage with this and this will give the real meaning to the land of opportunities. The American people's ancestors come from different parts of the world. The OPT program can keep many talents in science and technology to make contributions to US and chase their own American dreams. Please keep US being diversified and powerful and give everyone an opportunity to choose their dream.
