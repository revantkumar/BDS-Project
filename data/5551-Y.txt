Yelin Zhou I strongly agree with the OPT STEM extension policy.I believe that more OPT time will bring more benefit to the US.

-International student will accept lower salary. Since it is hard to find a job, especially offering H1B or just have the E-verify, international will not picky to the employer. They will accept offer even the salary is lower than the average. Low salary will reduce the finical pressure for some brilliant start up company. However native student will compare different offers since they always have choice and make some startup company loose chance to get awesome employees.

-International student will work harder in the position. Of course this is not all the way true. But since international student has risk of losing job, they will always keep themselves to be a good employers. Even the laziest student will put 200% effort into the job because they need to.

-Job field demand. Especially in IT area. I believe US IT area will be in risk in the future if OPT extension is canceled. Most employee in IT are Indians and Chinese. As the competition of H1B lottery became harder and harder, IT area company will lose ability to keep there employees since no OPT extension means only one time lottery, which is few chance to get the H1B. Another concern is that there is not enough native american interested in IT. But now, the market of IT area is already exist, if US doesn't keep the rate of international employees, it will bring risk to the IT area in the next few years.

-International student helps improve the consuming level. Most of international student study in US has family support, some of their relatives will travel to US time by time. Stay in the US means keep consuming. This consuming definitely improve the US finance, not only in grocery but also in luxury. This situation also provide more job position to lower educated people indirectly. If no more consumption, the job position in those area will be not necessary and cause more and more unemployment of US native.

-Keep talent. OPT STEM are all high tech area. Give them more time to work means increase the chance to let them decide if they want to stay here or not. Right now around the world, talent is the most important thing. The improvement of US cannot keep growing with newly technologies.

Because of all those reasons above, I recommend the US government to approve the new OPT Extension policy. Maybe somebody will say international student are taking their opportunity, but this is not true because diligent, smart people will always lead of the world .
