I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. Diversity is very important for the U.S. This is why U.S. is U.S. today. Without skillful alien's contributions, it is almost not possible for the United States to maintain such a position in the world. 
2. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. The foreign students do not compete with local people because of low salaries. Most of STEM students can obtain a very good salary compared with many citizens. The competition does not exist between STEM students and citizens because there are not many citizens choosing these majors.
