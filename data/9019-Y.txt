I definitely support this proposal. 

It is beneficial for the U.S. economy and society improvement if the international students who learned knowledge from universities in the U.S. can have a better chance to work for U.S. companies after graduation. International students with higher degrees (usually with bachelor or higher degree) will be a huge boost for the U.S.. And it is a waste for educational resource to send them back to their home countries soon after graduation.
