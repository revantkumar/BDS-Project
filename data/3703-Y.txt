I strongly SUPPORT this regulation. This regulation is for F-1 STEM students OPT extension, it is not for all international students! This regulation has nothing to do with immigration. 

Even though students can apply H1B during OPT, there are thousands H1B visa to foreigners who didn't have college in U.S. OPT will attract talented students to study here. America is an immigration country, it should always be a place to attract talented people. 

I look though many negative comments, they looks almost the same and not about this regulation. There is even an anti-immigration website provide templates for negative comments see this link. http://www.stopoverreach.com 

U.S. need more STEM students. U.S technique companies need workforce to keep on top-tier of the world. U.S. education system need attract talented students to study here. U.S. is always an immigration country. Therefore, this regulation should be approved!
