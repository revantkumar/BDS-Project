This rule is a wise choice. American companies have so large amount of jobs regarding STEM degrees that America do not have enough native graduates to fulfill these jobs. These jobs will let America lead the science and technology industry for decades. The companies need the extra graduate to do the jobs. Letting the eligible students work for American easily will probably not affect American graduates' job opportunities but make great benefit for America.
