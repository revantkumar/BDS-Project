This is not true. Just take a look at California and Silicon Valley, many foreign new grads make $100K a year and there are huge demands for these positions. Moreover, the hiring bar for foreign students is higher than that for American students. If an American STEM student can not find a job, he or she should learn more skill sets instead of complaining about STEM extension or foreign students.
