You're looking at the wrong end of the horse. With the high cost of education and very little if any help from the very ones complaining 
about foreign TECH/Medical professional people had better think twice. Right now there's a shortage of professionals because of not
not being train. An explicit example; I was out at VA clinic and had to wait several hours to see my doctor as she was covering 
for a doctor that was out. Other cases from the news; in NY medical facility patients were denied treatment because of a
shortage of medical people. Look presently at the head medical staff in hospitals, that will speak for itself. So the problem
is not letting in foreign professional people but for not provide finance and help to train the young people that need it. So
you're pointing the gun in the wrong direction. I would rather have help from anywhere/anyone if that help is not at home.
