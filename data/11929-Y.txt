It is totally wrong to bypass US workers, in order to offer these jobs to foreigners period!
Offer training, spend money in our workers, offer incentives to advance in their jobs, instead of offering employers tax breaks when using foreign workers!

What kind of country is this, where the citizens are delegated to second place, instead of offering the education and training they deserve as citizens of this country, there is no shortage, there is no lack of interest or jobs people are not willing to do, what it is to much politics and favoritism to corporations and the middle class more and more in decline!
