I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. It's essential and vital for US economy to have talented and hardworking foreign work force in IT area, as has shown in the past decades.

2. Longer OPT will attract/inspire more international students to come to U.S., thus contribute to the economy of domestic industries such as department stores, health insurance, car dealers.

3. U.S. is a country of freedom and equal rights. It would be against such will if the OPT extension regulation cannot pass.
