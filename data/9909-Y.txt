I strongly agree with this proposal. Improving and expanding STEM's OPT will not only benefit US technology companies but also make a great contribution to US economics. Nowadays, it's a time of information and technology, numbers of new startups are emerging every minute in the US, and the head of the company wants to hire the best employee in the world. Cutting out the best candidates will deeply weaken US's first place of economy and technology in the world. OPT STEM students are not taking over citizen's jobs. The needs of technology companies are over the capacity of citizens can give. Also OPT STEM students have contributed a lot to US and US companies, the development of these companies will provide a lot of more jobs to citizens, too. America is the land of freedom, I'm sure that the government will make the right decision.
