Catherine T. Black Indeed, I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. these students has studied useful knowledge from US, we should supply them a job so that they could make contributes to our country, and they also could have more passion to create. 

2. And all good and creative things what they did in our country also are benefited to everyone in US. They are international students, they are also an employee, an talent with creativity, kind hearts. We supply a chance to them for work, we also have a chance to get better lives.

3.Of course, there are some competitions. However, the reason the international students could be employed is our society is lack of the people who has these skills. If there are not enough technology students in US, many companies will be in dangers. 

And it seems that their salaries and are lower than citizens, so I don't think this proposal will do harm to our society
