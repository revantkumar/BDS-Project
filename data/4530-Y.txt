Hi 
I support this decision very strongly. It's just not a decision. It's life and a motion of so many international students who come here spending a ton of money with several dreams to acheive what they cannot do in their home country.This new opt extension rule will be very helpful for us as we'll get to gain some real time experience in here and get to know how corporate world will be here in USA. 12 months is a very short period of time to get to know this. It would be helpful if there will be an extension. We hope there will be a decision made according to the rule formulated.
When you see 100000 people signed for opt extension , you see how much it means to international students.
It is no harm for any one if they work here in coorporate companies.They are not taking any citizens opportunities.every one have their opportunity, if they prove themselves.The knowledge they gain here after working for 29 months, many of them are taking their experiences to their home countries and help them to achieve what they have not seen.I hope the decision comes with the opt extension and all the international students will continue work with flying colors.Thank you DHS for formulating a better rule. We are with you an will be with you.
Thanks
