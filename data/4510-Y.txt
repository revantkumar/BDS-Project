I strongly support this rule. The people who said the international student will take the job opportunities form US citizen is extremely short eyesight. What I see is that the talent international student can apply what they learned in USA into American's development which can bring more job opportunities and gain the power of this country. As we know the high development speed of IT industry helped US pass the 2009 financial crisis and help to bring more job opportunities. The STEM international students played a indispensable role and help these tech companies' grows like GOOGLE, AMAZON, FACEBOOK etc.

Extend the OPT time is not only good for international students to enhance their knowledge but also can create more job position for the whole country. If US just keep these clear international student from American, our country will lose the power to move forward.
