Edward Tankersley I strongly SUPPORT the proposal to extend the OPT. This will be a proposal benefits both United states and international students instead of causing troubles to American society. In the past decades, international students have make great contributions in different technology fields and bring novelty and core competitiveness to their companies and help them improve profits. Each year, h1b holders pay more than 27%, and often more than 30% of their salary to the federal, and even more to the federal and the state. This money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people.

In addition, terminating the OPT extention will significantly reduce the chance of talented student to come to US for their study and career, this will definitely cut the revenues of government, universities, landlords (who rent their places to international students), airlines (international students travel a lot each year), and etc. International students have become an inseparable part of american society, and any ideas against the extention would lead to society instability, industry collapse and impedement of science.
