I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. Many F-1 students do make great contribution to the U.S in the past years.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. Many great contributors were international students before they contributed to the U.S.
