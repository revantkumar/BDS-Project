Hua Wong I fully support this policy.

According the investigation of NAFSA, during 13-14 academic year, there were 886, 052 foreign students studying in the U.S., which contributed 26.8 trillion dollar to the U.S. economy in tuition, living consumption and other aspects. There were also 340,000 americans who got jobs related with international student education issues. The number of international students is growing recent years and still ongoing. If the policy is terminated, many of the potential students who are also consumers would not like to get educated in U.S.. This is a huge loss for the recovering U.S. economy. I don't think that it is wise to stop it.
