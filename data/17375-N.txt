There is not a valid reason to continue this program let alone expend it when we have so many of our students with debt and unable to find a job. Other countries need to work at taking care of their own people and not rely on the USA for a handout which we can not afford. We cannot be displacing our own students by allowing other foreign students to compete against them and have our government be providing the financial support or incentives.

All in all, our government has not been authorized by the people to give money away to foreign interests at all and doing so goes against the will of the people. 

Students in this system now cannot be tracked and many have become illegal aliens and are getting additional benefits from the government adding even more to the long term costs of such a program.

I want to strongly give some thought to the actual effects of this program and it's detrimental effect that is has on our nation.

Kill this program and it's associated bureaucracy. We already have other programs to help students.

Sincerely

Ryan
