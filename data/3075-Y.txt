Beverly Johnson I used to work in an alternative school in Charles County Maryland that offered Vo-tech programs to high school juniors and seniors.

One of the offerings was an accredited horticulture program. As the school's counselor, I approached a sod/truck farming facility in the hope of securing summer jobs for the students only to be told that the only thing the owner needed was a foreman, who spoke Spanish. The most disturbing part of this whole scenario is that the owner is one of our state legislators. Our teens need summer and part-timer employment and should be employed over foreign workers.

Needless to say, this politician will never receive another vote from me.
