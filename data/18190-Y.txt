I think the extension of OPT would behighly beneficial to the US in several aspects. First, it helps the academiclevel of colleges and universities remain leading position around the world. Ifthe STEM is cancelled, many student might have chosen Britain or Canada astheir first choice of studying abroad. Second, foreign students havecontributed a lot also for the renting market, restaurants, entertainmentindustry of almost all major cities within the states. This great potential ofconsuming would definitely do good to the economy especially when the USeconomy is in the essential phase of recovery. Last but not least, many keyscientific projects of the country need foreign students to make theircontributions. With the math, programming, physics and chemistry knowledgeoffered by foreign students, these projects and researches would thenaccelerate and finally yield new medication and new technology applicationswhich at last would benefit all citizens to improve their living quality andliving environment. Therefore, in general, I think the extension of OPT wouldbe a great help for the whole country itself.
