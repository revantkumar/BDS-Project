To whom it may end with,

I am on SS disability, and it is my understanding that my Government has already stolen the Money that I invested in myself though my working years and now is causing programs ( STEM,OPT ) that stop Americans from adding to the SS program, which is limiting me from receiving my needed raises this year and future years ahead of me.

Sincerely,

Charles K. Kriston
