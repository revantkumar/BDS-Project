America is a country with mixed culture and people with diverse backgrounds. That is one of the most important reasons why it has been developing so fast since it founded. Support and rights should be given to people with STEM backgrounds, not only to help those foreigners but also to make America a stronger country with all the elites. There is no reason to ban those people out of the country when they love the land and contribute to it.
