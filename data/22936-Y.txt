I really think 24-month opt extension is a good rule not only for those STEM international students, but US will also benefit from it. The US technology industry will keep growing and achieve progress with the knowledge and skills of those high educated students working as employees in different companies. They may make great contribution to the market, since they came from different culture and background, and they would come up with new and different prospects which are good to the US industries.
