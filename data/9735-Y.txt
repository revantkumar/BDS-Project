I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S .

2. U.S. is a immigration country. Toleration and quality is the characters of U.S. And they are also the reason why U.S. is the strongest country. Many people who have made a contribution for this country
were international students of U.S. universities.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. As we all known, these companies cannot find right local people for these positions so that they tends to the international students. Competition helps improving the competitiveness of U.S.
