I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. Foreign students can not be ignored. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S.. 
2. Diversity is so important for US. US is an immigrant country. That is why makes it so powerful. So US should continue doing these kinds of things.
3. Competition can make people progressive and be a better man.
4. We love America, and we want to make contribution to it.
