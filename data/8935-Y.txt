I totally support this new rule. I work in a tech company in Bay Area, and I could see lot of international student around. They are young, smart, and creative. But they all have a nightmare when talking about OPT and H1B. Many of them are leaving US not because of they want to leave, but because of they can't get a visa and we are pushing them out. I would love to see a new rule like this to help them, and also to help the country to attract and respect creative people.

By the way, I see some people are standing against this rule, and blame those students for the unemployment rate. It doesn't make any sense. In these STEM field, there are tons of new openings everyday, the "unemployment" they are talking is not really created by these international students.

Again, thanks for all the effort to improving and expanding the OPT.
