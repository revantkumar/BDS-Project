I saw a lot of comments saying that native born Americans / citizens are threatened by the extension, but this is not true, and there is no evidence to show that work opportunities will be taken away from them by extending STEM OPT period. International students are here to communicate so that Americans and foreign students can learn from each other, and become better together. There is no point to say that international student accept low wages just to stay in US, better opportunities do exist outside US. The reason we come to US and stay here is no difference from US people travel to other countries to study and experience their life there. OPT extension will greatly encourage the opportunity for students from all around world learn and communicate together, and only people want to stay foolish and lock themselves in their own small world will be against it.
