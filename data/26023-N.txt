OPT is costing us millions of dollars, and we are broke and in debt.

Expanding OPT will cost us more millions of dollars, and we are broke and in deep debt!

Aiding and abetting foreigners while denying service to citizens is both illegal and immoral!

American STEM graduates are apparently having trouble finding proper employment in our socialistic economy. Employ them first!

If trained STEM personnel are valuable assets and they come from third world countries that need them, why not allow them to return and serve! They will probably do a lot more good than our foreign aid that goes to politicians and warlords and other assorted thievery.

The federal government should stick to those jobs assigned to it by the Constitution! Like border security and national defense. Both of which are sadly neglected!
