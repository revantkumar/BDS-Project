I strongly support this proposed rule. Here are the reasons: OPT helps students to understand better about the knowledge they learned from the college. Application in real world of the knowledge make it more useful. That is somehow the goal of education. As they study in college for several years, one year OPT is probably not enough for them to connect their knowledge to the real world and benefit the employer. Also right now, the economic in the US is pretty good and there are a lot more H1B Visa applications than the H1B visas. If OPT is only one year, then some students may not be able to really achieve the goal which OPT is supposed to help them to get.
