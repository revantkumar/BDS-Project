I support this reule, because this provides US a chance to increase the number of skilled workers, and it is also an incentive for STEM students to stay and work in the States. It is a win-win situation. Now with globalization, R&D ability in science and technology is a key to staying competitive. This rule will help US to attract the workforce it needs to lead the global economy.

Some people oppose this rule because they are afraid foreigners will take their jobs, but their fear does not have realistic grounds. We all know that more people means more demand, and more demand means more opportunities for everyone. Job market is not a static pool with only a certain amount of water. On the contrast, it is constantly dynamic and always self-adjusting to changes. In addition, foreign students actually have to overcome more challenges than US students because of their status.

Others oppose this rule because they do not welcome immigrants, but they might have forgotten that almost all Americans once were immigrants. United States is a country founded by immigrants, and immigration has always been a huge part of the history and culture of this country. Would those people deny their forefathers of american dreams?
