I strongly SUPPORT expanding the extension of OPT for STEM students. It will help US technology companies keep being most innovative in the world and lead the rest of the world. US has been very attractive to talented STEM students around the world because it offers greatest opportunities by allowing them to work at least two and a half years (under the old extension). This is one of the key reasons why US technology companies have become most innovative in the world. To keep US companies stay on this leading position, it is necessary to expand the extension of OPT for STEM students.
