Expend OPT extension to 24 months will increase the economy of the US significantly. Below are the reasons:
1. Highly educated students will have more chances to use their knowledge to contribute the country. 
2. Students who has STEM degree are more likely to work for high tech companies which help US companies to have more good candidates to be chosen.
3. US Universities will have more international students which increase the income of universities significantly from the additional international student tuition 
4. Students who have STEM degree will have more time to contribute to the US economic such as Federal tax and State tax. In additional, once students have their H1B visa, then they will be able to pay more social security and medicare.
5. The student's family will have greater chance to support the student to a better college to gain their STEM degree which require higher tuition
6. Students who had STEM degree are more likely to have marriage in the US because of the extension of OPT is expend which students' suppose will contribute to US economic in another way
7. Students who have children will have greater chance to continue their education in the US which may also increase US economic.

I am fully support this new rule, and hope this rule could be effected before Feb 16 2016.
