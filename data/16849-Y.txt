Dear Officer,

This regulation is great for the U.S as a country and for U.S. citizen.

Here's why:

1. OPT program can attract more international student who pay higher tuition to the US college. This definitely will help to reduce the deficit of the higher education system, and benefit the public university.

2. Help to build the small and medium business in the states. Small and medium business in the U.S. is hard to find qualified engineers nowadays. OPT STEM students are perfect candidate for this kind of business.

3. Promote the U.S market. Usually, the OPT STEM students work for High-Tech company which provide the a higher salary, and thus they have more money to consume. This definitely will help the U.S. market.

All mentioned above can really benefit U.S and its nation. Please approve this regulation. Thanks.

Sincerely,

Shang Meng
