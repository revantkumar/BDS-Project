I am a high school student from Houston, TX. I have been doing extracurricular research in MD Anderson Cancer Center for three years. I doubt that the Medical Center will still run properly without the immigrants. An instructor of mine is still applying for his H1-B visa. If he cannot get it this time, he will have no choice but going back to China. I am pretty sure that he would find a decent job there, if he went. However, our country will lose an outstanding cancer scholar.
