I support the OPT extension for STEM students. Let's first see pros and cons.

Pros:
1. Attract more international students to our country. This means more money goes to universities and that would in retrospective benefits US students.
2. It helps tech companies hire more talents, therefore increase their revenue and improve the country's economical gain.

Cons:
1. It might increase the competition to a small portion of US STEM majored students.

However, I am supportive to the policy. I can see pros are far over cons. The fact is domestic STEM students is only a small portion and this extension will have little effects on them. Plus, many companies do not hire international students for lower cost; in fact, the cost is higher for international students when going over immigration issues. Companies like Google, Microsoft even invest a lot to hire employees from abroad to promote technical revolution. STEM students only make up a small proportion on their employees. On the other hand, US STEM students are always favored by tech companies and the hiring bars are lower for domestic than international students. We by no means should restrict this 24-month extension.
