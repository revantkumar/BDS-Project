I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. My own daughter who is graduating this semester will have to compete with 100,000 foreign workers - Foreign workers who employers have an unjust 7.65% tax benefit to hire the foreign worker over my own American daughter. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. If companies hire 100,000 students earning $50K per year, those companies will save over $3.8B in payroll taxes combined.That's quite an incentive, and one we should not be offering at the expense of our own American workers...our own children. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.
