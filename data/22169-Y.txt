It's really astonishing to see so many negative comments about the proposal. Looks like most of the negative comments are highly organized and are from the same template. In a great country like US, it's really embarrassing to see this kind of things happening.

I strongly support this proposal! 

1. The extension is only for students from STEM majors. It has very tiny impact on the job market of the US citizens, since most US citizens are not very into these majors. The extension of OPT will increase the number of employees in STEM area, which in turn will increase the demand for all the related service areas. Those areas are mostly occupied by US citizens. As a result, instead of being a threat of US citizens, the extension of OPT will create more jobs for them.

2. For companies and colleges, they invested a lot of money to train the international students. Unfortunately, in the past a few years, many of the students were forced to terminate their jobs due to visa problems. It's actually a huge resource waste for both the colleges and companies. They have invested so much on the students. They should have higher return from them. 

3. For international students, they come here from all over the world, believing US is the right place to learn knowledge and apply the knowledge to real work. Unfortunately, they have to spend a big chunk of their time dealing with all the visa problems. Longer OPT extension is exactly the solution everyone is longing for. 

Overall speaking, I didn't see any negative impact of longer OPT extension. To people who will leave comments here and people who will decide the future of the proposal, this is the golden chance to make US a better country than ever before. Please make it happen!
