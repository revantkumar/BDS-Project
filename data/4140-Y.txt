I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons:

1. Recent college grads have a lot of potential. Foreign students are no exception.

2. Our country will benefit from contributions of recent grads from all over the world. Anyone with a different background and culture will have different ideas and skills from the typical American worker.

3. Including more skilled workers in the economy will create an incentive for everyone to become more competitive and grow.
