I am against bringing foreign tech. workers into this country and filling jobs that qualified American workers should have first priority in acquiring . Keep American jobs in America for American workers. Our combined educational facilities can produce enough qualified workers to fill these positions. Many of our graduates cannot find employment because many of these jobs are filled by foreign workers. IF our unemployment was 0% then foreign workers MIGHT be an option but not now.
Only those who are lawfully in this country should be considered if American citizens are not available to fill these positions.
