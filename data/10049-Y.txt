International students graduating from US universities should be given the opportunity to prolong their stay after graduation through OPT by 24 months. I think this would allow students to better apply what they learned in college and garner the expertise needed to get a job in the future. I think this is in the benefit not only of the students; such a immigrant-friendly measure would benefit US as well, making sure the brightest and the best work here.
