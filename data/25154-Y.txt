I oppose OPT program. First of all there is no limit on the F1 visa numbers and that's why we see millions and millions of foreign students in the US. OPT extension gives them a lot of time to carry out all sorts of criminal activities(terrorism, drugs, fraud, working and staying in the US illegally(as it is impossible to manage and keep track of millions and millions of foreign students) And this number is creasing exponentially every year!! This growing number of foreigners is a big threat to our country as there is no cap on F1 visas!
