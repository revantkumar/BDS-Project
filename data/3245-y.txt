Junwei Xing I think the the extension of OPT for STEM fields to 24 months is crucial, not only to international students with higher degrees, but also to native Americans. The extension can give talented international students more chances to severe American companies with their highly trained professional skills. It is well known that international students with higher degrees are the backbone for the development and prosperity of lots of American companies. On the other hands, the development of such companies definitely are beneficial to native Americans. Native Americans can have more opportunities if such companies are doing well. The revenue collected from those companies can be redistributed to improve the living standard of the whole community. I summary, I strongly support the extension of OPT. Thanks.
