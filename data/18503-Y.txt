International students came to USA for study with high expense and time. They should have the opportunities to have the extended time for working and training. Especially for STEM program students, they put more efforts and deal with harder course contents. It's totally unfair to cancel this OPT opportunity and shut the door for them. Canceling OPT can also greatly influence international student rate, which takes a large proportion of US university's population. They need the OPT, please don't cancel it!!
