We should not be extending any opportunities to non-Americans in our workforce.
We do not need to compete with the entire world at their wages and skill levels. 
They have their own conditions that keep their wages in check. 
We need to take care of our own people before we help others by extending this period further than it is currently set up.
Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it. 
I like the idea of bringing talented smart individuals to America, to be an American and help our country prosper with diversity but we cannot accomplish this if we continually give way at the expense of our own children's future.
If we are to truly help ourselves by helping the rest of the world, we need to first take care of ourselves and be smart about how we share our information to those who may possibly only be out to undermine our society and free way of life we so enjoy.
The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates.
This program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields.
As a result, it's quite obvious that this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers.
This program actually creates an incentive for employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or realistic prevailing wage with all these exceptions to the rule.
Please stop the senseless giving away of our own talents, resources and chance for our children to be the best they can be.
Do not allow this exception to pass into law.
