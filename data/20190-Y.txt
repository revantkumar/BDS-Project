The policy to attract foreign talents should continue.Our economy is powered by IT companies, and IT companies are powered by international STEM students. Let alone say many universities are earning a lot from international students by tuition.

Depriving the opportunities for international talents is depriving the opportunities of America. This is the truth.

So, please let this policy pass. We cannot afford another economic recession!
