Dear Mr. and Mrs. Hofacker, 

When you list the number of jobs taken by OPT students and the money paid to them, please also consider the profit they made to US companies, the tax they paid to support the society, and the new job opportunities they created using their talent. Your numbers do not stand on their own without looking at the entire spectrum. 

Also, as a minor comment, please give credit to the original authors when you cite their words.
