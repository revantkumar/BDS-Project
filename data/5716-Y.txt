The rule is very clear and the document gives a lot of information. As an international student myself, I support this rule completely. 

My OPT started in March 2015 and I got a job in April 2015 so I could not apply for an H1-B visa and as my OPT would only be for a year, without the extension my OPT would expire in Feb 2016 and I would not get a chance to apply for my H1-B at all. The STEM extension would help me and a lot of other students like me a lot.

I also noticed that the employers and our universities would have a lot of paperwork to go through if I get a job during my STEM extension. I would request the authorities to look into this and try reducing the paperwork as much as they can because this might restrict us from getting jobs as the employers would not be willing sometimes to hire us as they would have to go through all this paperwork.
