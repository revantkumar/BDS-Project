I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons:

(1) The extension of training opportuinities for F-1 student can incent demands. Based on my observation, the international students who can study in US have strong purchase power. Just think about the difference of populaiton in US and China; think about why international business want to launch business to China, think about how much debt American students owe and how much money Chinese students have. American care about less debt, we care about more savings.

(2) Improving and expanding training opportunities can improve the economy in US. Most of the F-1 students are well-educated. Their knowledge and skills will definitely improve the qulity of business performance. The higher quality of the employees, the more stable the business and economy will be.
