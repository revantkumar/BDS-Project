I support this proposal. If this is approved, the F1 students in STEM could stay longer and bring benefits in several aspects. 
We all know that America original is composed by a wide range of different races. History already proved that this could combined multiple cultures together and give you the chance to absorb and utilize their good characters. Actually this is kind of like one of the best spirits of the US since the beginning.
Someone may say that this will take away citizen's job opportunities. But I don't think so. As most of the STEM students will do the research jobs after they graduated. And these kind of jobs are not so popular for citizens. Most citizens would like to get a job and start earning money right after they graduated from college. They're not interested in research. But we all know that research is very important for advanced techs. And these techs is so important for the country's development, espically in STEM fields.
It is very common that citizens don't want to get further education if they could get a job easily. I think this is not good for the long run. Well this proposal to some extend could stimulate those people to improve themselves so that they could win in the competition. Which is clearly a very good thing for the country.
The country could give chances to those people who are not well educated. Why not give the same chance to the best skilled people from all over the world?
