I strongly support the new OPT extension rule. I'm an international student who graduated with my MS degree and currently work in the largest privately owned bank in the U.S. In my team, all my colleagues and boss are not Americans. We are doing highly technical and complicated works which need international students like me. I believe this rule will bring a lot benefits to US economy and various industries like high tech and financial institutions. Without the OPT extension rule, it is not possible to attract the great amounts of foreign students in the world since we have many choices when studying abroad. Most importantly, these students are the valuable talents that can impact the economy. In short, if this new rule is terminated by some reasons, it is definitely a huge loss and disaster for lots of enterprises without doubt.
