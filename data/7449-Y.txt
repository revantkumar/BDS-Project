Andy Plumber Unbelievable. When are we going to do something for American workers. I'm a white construction worker in Houston, TX and I don't speak Spanish. That puts me in the minority. Fortunately, I have a Spanish speaking apprentice and I can communicate with the framers, concrete crews, sheetrock crews, iron workers and some electricians. Yep, you guessed it, I'm a plumber, and some of our apprentices don't speak English. Are the policies of our government to disenfranchise American workers. We're so busy paying taxes to support those who don't want to work that it's hard to have any fun after paying the mortgage. And here the Feds are trying to support the rest of the world on my back. I'm sick of it. I do NOT support keeping foreign workers here after their training. Tell the American employers to stuff it. To those that have the authority to do the right thing, I say "GROW A PAIR!!!"
