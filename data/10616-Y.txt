Thank homeland security department for proposing this new rule. I think this rule is beneficial to the economic growth of USA. Extension of opt will allow international students have more time to work for US companies and work with US citizens. During this period, through the interaction of different cultures and backgrounds, both sides could learn from each other, thus increasing the opportunity of innovation of technology and growth of economy, which are critical to the prosperity of USA. With an open attitude toward international students, not only USA gives an opportunity to international students, but also USA gives itself an opportunity since technology innovation doesn't discriminate among people from different countries.
