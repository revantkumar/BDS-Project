I disagree with some comments against this rule.
If you are taking an interview, the straight way to make you in is that you tell other candidates that they are not allowed to apply for this job. However, in the long-run, is that the right?
The right way you want to do is to study and prepare your interview instead of blocking others.
If you block F1 students today,someday you will try to block out-state applicants the future.
