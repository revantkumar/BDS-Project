I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1.International students bring much fortune to US, their tuition for college are much higher than the local people, which greatly help the university as well as other business.

2. International students who majoring in engineering related field boost the increasing growth of high-tech companies. And people from other countries can have different points of views on the same object, which in turn could lead to creativities.

3. If the length of OPT is not long enough, international student could not fully using their professional skills to bring benefits to companies, and company would facing great problems that they have to searching for other person to fill the great shortage to meet their highly increasing rate.

All in all, I strongly SUPPORT the proposal!
