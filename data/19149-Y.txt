International students who major STEM programs deserve the extra 17 month OPT extension. When they choose to study in USA, they also consider the options after they graduate. 17 month is a long time and is a big deal for those students. If they knew about this, they might chose a different major or different universities. The change of such a significant program should be gradual. It would be very unfair for students who are in the process of applying OPT Extension. They paid their application fees and prepared all the materials while worrying about whether they are getting extra 17 months.
