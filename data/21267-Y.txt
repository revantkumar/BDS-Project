I strongly support this rule for following reasons:
1. United States is a country built by immigrants. Giving the foreign student a opt extension will attract more talented foreigners to come to the U.S. for study and stay here to contribute to this great country. 
2. Everyone should have a chance to prove himself and contribute to this country after graduation from universities
3. It will greatly enhance the competence of High tech companies if many talented foreign students could stay here and work for them. That's the reason why the US is always the country of innovation. This OPT extension will give those companies a opportunity to keep those talented foreigner here for continuous innovation.
