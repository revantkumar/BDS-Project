I have to say that STEM workers might not be enough... At least now it is not enough. All those huge technology companies are still trying to hire more engineers to develop better products. And also, foreign labors are not cheap. They are even more expensive as the employers have to sponsor their visa besides paying salary. This rule will help attract all the smart people to the U.S. to develop the industry and the society, thus creating more jobs for all the U.S. citizens.
