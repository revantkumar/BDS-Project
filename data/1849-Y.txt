Hongqian Wu I greatly support the OPT extension. I was a master student in mathematics where at the time half of the graduate students in the math department were international students. We took the responsibilities of being a teaching assistant, preparing lectures, holding office hours, grading and performing all kinds of related duties. Without the contribution of the international students, the math department would be in short in teaching resources. 

Also, when I was a math teaching assistant ship, I taught engineering math I and calculus I. There are quite many international undergraduate students in each class. They were all engineering/biology students. They paid out-state level tuition which contributed to the university finally.

There are numerous other reasons too. It would definitely be beneficial to the US to approve the OPT extension.
