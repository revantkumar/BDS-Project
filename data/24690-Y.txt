I'm a graduate international student from NYU Tandon school majoring in CS, from my point of view, the thought of cancelling OPT extension is just a stupid idea. It goes against the Americans sprint of liberty and it will also hurt the Americans economy.

Me, just like other international students, get an American dream, we come here for knowledge and success. We study hard and we believe our hard work will lead to a bright future. Last week, there is a small ceremony for outstanding graduate students, it turns out almost all of these students including me are international ones, and I believe these talents deserve more opportunities after they graduates. 

Also as I mentioned, there are so many talents from international students. They will deliver their knowledge and determination to this STEM industry, they will work hard to lead to they success of the company they are working in and they will pay tax to feedback to the society. Recently the economy goes on well here and the unemployment rate is almost the lowest point within past 10 years. So Its just ridicules just to cancel the OPT extension and shut down the door to all of these international talents.
