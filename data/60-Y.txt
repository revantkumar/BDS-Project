It is a great idea to expand opt. Every year there are thousands of students come to US. America offers so many great opportunities for everyone to accept advanced education. After graduation, lots of people find a job. As I know, there are so many foreigners in IT companies and financial institutions and many of them hold master degree and Doctor degree. They are in the high end position and work for US. Some people are very talented with high level skills since they are trained in US for 4 years or even longer. It will be a great loss if they cannot make any contribution to America. After depression in 2008, there are more and more people needed to help US recover. It won't harm US companies and government to create more chances for excellent foreigners to make contribution.
