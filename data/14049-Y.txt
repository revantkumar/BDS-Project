One United States citizen should not decide the fate and outcome of thousands of legal & eligible candidates for jobs and positions that occur within US based companies and corporations. Not the President, nor members of Congress or the Senate for those that wish to work to support themselves or families. The income producing jobs that occur within the Unites States should be held for US citizens and not bartered or expanded to the open market until all the current legal residents of the US have an opportunity to train or become eligible for the position whether skilled or unskilled. The US allows billions of dollars in support to developing nations which takes resources that American workers have created in some capacity. Please do not take skilled positions and place on open market until all efforts to employ those who wish to apply for the position in the US have an opportunity possibly by expanding job placement within colleges and universities in America. 

I am a skilled IT professional working in the technology industry for 30 years. My position is very hard to fill within US borders as it requires years of certifications..one solution: offer focused training to students starting very early. If American corporations cannot locate skills to compete in a world market let the burden be on them to assist in the education process..
