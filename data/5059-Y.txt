Miguel Vega Please approve this new rule. That saves US technology, therefore save Americans. Don't be short-sighted.

Do fix the H1b and L1 program that are all but monopolized by Infosys, TCS, Cognizant and HCL, Deloitte and Accenture.
Foreign students pay premium dollars to get an American education, and deserve a little payoff, a little American dream. The American publicwill also benefit from the best and brightest international talents.

Without Opt, and with H1b being unavailable to American educated international students, American higher education industry will risk a death spiral because foreign students and parents will wake up to the scam. Their kids were wanted and called the best and brightest to pay top dollars, then the moment the kids graduate, they are not wanted any more by the American businesses.

This new rule is beneficial to the whole US society!
