I'm a stem student in opt extension right now. And I have a job in my related field, and I really wanna be picked by H1B in next year April. But now you tell my opt will expire in the next year February! I even don't have a chance to apply for H1B. It's not make sense at all! I have many friends in the same situation as me, all of them are so talented, please reconsider it... Thanks.
