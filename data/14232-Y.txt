I completely support this decision of expanding the OPT extension to 24 months. This is a very good initiative giving the brightest students from all over the world to unleash their potential with out worrying about the immigration status as soon as they graduate. United States will be the most diverse country. I believe this is just a starting step but lot more fixes are needed to make the legal immigration system fair and level playing field.
