I strongly support this new OPT extension rule.
Foreign student bring diversity to the US job market.
Unless a foreign student's employer participate in the E-Verify program, the student cannot apply for the OPT extension. When an employer participate E-Verify program, the employer have to agree it will provide equal opportunity to either US born worker or foreigner. So it will not hurt US job market.
