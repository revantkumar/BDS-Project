Our grandson is presently in his sophomore year of engineering studies at the University of Illinois. 
This opportunity was made possible because he, his parents and grandparents scrimped and saved for his tuition and associated costs. 
Many other STEM students were required by necessity to take out costly student loans to pay for their education. 
Their ability to secure meaningful employment in their field of study is being affected by the misuse of H-1B workers and jeopardizes their ability to repay their student loans.
Unscrupulous employers are now trying to circumvent limits on H-1B numbers by extending the OPT program. 
Please stop the abuse of these programs and institute protections for working American citizens.
