I strongly support the new rule, as it will benefit the international students with STEM degrees, high-tech companies with urgent needs of talented and specialized employees, and ultimately the whole society.

Many are concerned with the severe job competitions brought by STEM international students. Based on my experiences, there are too many reasons that can lead to difficult job seeking: the major itself, the background of the applicant, the preparation for interview, ... And it's way easier to complain about the flooding of F-1 students than try hard to adjust oneself to the market. When I was looking for positions in biotech and pharmaceutical companies early this year, twenty percent of the positions I saw simply ignored international applicants. For the rest of them, many preferred experienced persons or citizens. I only got offers for positions which match my background perfectly.

For most companies, they consider more about the value brought by the new person, less about the money/taxes they potentially can save because of the hiring. The only exceptions I found are some outsourcing companies, which hire directly from developing countries. STEM students usually avoid low-paying jobs because these are really insults to the efforts/time/money they spent.
