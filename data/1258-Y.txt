People who are against OPT extension should be clear whether salaries those high-tech companied provide to foreign STEM students are really lower than US citizens. If not, they should stop complaining that foreign STEM students get employed because they accept lower wages. Actually those high-tech companies know exactly what expertise will be qualified as their employees. People complaining that foreign STEM students take their jobs, should really think about whether they worked hard enough to make themselves qualified to high-tech companies. Universities in US spend lots of resources and time on training foreign STEM students. It will be a waste and a loss for US if those talented and hard-working foreign students cannot work and contribute to US economy.
