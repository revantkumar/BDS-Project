why is not one half the effort that is being put into foreign workers being put into Americans, as long as the unemployment rates are as high as they are now there should be no need what so ever in increasing the time these workers can stay here, as a matter of fact their time should be shortened and less visas should be issued.can we not educate our own American children as well? and train them to take these jobs that way some one will be filling these jobs that can stay with the employer for 20 years, not just 2 or 3 years, longevity should be in the employers best interest,also we have many qualified individuals sitting not doing anything with their time therefore this looks like an employer just trying to get cheap labor at the cost of the American tax payer, so my humble opinion the only change to the rules should be to reduce the number of visas and the amount of time the individual can stay in this country after graduating thank you for your attention to this matter.
