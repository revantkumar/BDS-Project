Austin Clark You must be aware about thousands of dollars international students pore in the US economy every year by paying huge international fees. International students are also helping to fill skills shortages at a time when the US share of the world's science and engineering graduates is declining. Our country has reached on top of the world because of the technology and because of this rule actually the whole world is contributing towards the technological growth of our country. Economists have argued that the technology those STEM workers helped create has accounted for nearly half of the nation's economic growth in the second half of the twentieth century. If intelligent International students with STEM degrees are allow ed to work more, they would definitely contribute greatly more to the American economics as well as the technology development.
