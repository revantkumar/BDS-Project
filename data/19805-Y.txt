I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international mathematics finance master student from China and is a investment analyst with Franklin Templeton Investments. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my master degree in US, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and England. The most important reason I chose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. 

If this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. because they are mainly supported by foreign STEM talents. Even for more and more financial institutions like investment banks or asset management firms, young talents with strong quantitative background and skills are badly needed, so foreign STEM talents can make great contributions to the US financial industry as well.
