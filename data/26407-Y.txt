I fully support this bill. The U.S. has a severe lack of qualified technical workers in the advanced STEM fields without a proper domestic interest by the students themselves to increase the amount of U.S. Citizens who have these degrees. Without such an existing pipeline we should not turn away the thousands of foreign students we graduate each year in these fields from finding work. It was people such as these that came to the U.S. In the 18 and 1900's that helped advance the U.S. Into what it is today. In actuality most citizens today come from those same immigrants back then that we are turning away today.

Without a continuous stream of the best and brightest coming into the U.S. we are simply denying those that would pursue the "American Dream" while simultaneously handing other nations and their economies a highly trained workforce to our detriment.
