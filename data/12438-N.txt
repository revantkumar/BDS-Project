My grandparents, parents and I have worked all our lives to prepare this country for our kids and grandchildren. This is a slap in the face to all citizens of this country to give non-citizens priority over hard working Americans. What planet are you on and what gives you the right to do this? This is total BS and one day, when the right party is in control, I hope you'll be standing in an unemployment line for a long time.
