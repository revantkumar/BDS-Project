I strongly support the OPT extension!

(1) First of all, why USA is the NO 1 country in the world? One important reason is lots of smart people from different countries contribute their knowledge to USA after they graduate from school. This people are very smart because most of them already got their advanced degree. They have opportunities since OPT extension. Otherwise, they will go back to their countries and do nothing for United States.
(2) Second, why USA can attract so many excellent students to United States? One important reason is their OPT or OPT extension program. They know that studying in USA not only can offer them with degree but also they can earn several years of working experience which is more important than degree. After they go back to their own country, they are more competitive than other people.
(3) Third, healthy competition is good for a country. Local people can improve theirselves comparing with foreign employee. And usually, foreign students are more industrious. 
(4) Finally, if OPT extension program is cancelled, as I know, lots of high tech companies will suffer a lot, including google, facebook etc. Also, they will lost lots of university applications. Because they will not spend so much money for a degree and only one year OPT, which doesn't help a lot when they go back to their own countries.
