Ruyi Wang I would like to support the elongation of OPT. OPT is designed for finding a work or intern opportunity, not an immigration related opportunity. In terms of working, STEM students should have enough time to find a job. I personally do not believe the elongation of OPT will cause harm to any immigration issue.
