I do not support proposed ICEB rule to expand and improve training opportunities for F-1 students. I DO SUPPORT the improvement and expansion of support for American students to receive the valuable job experience that this rule proposes we give to foreign students. These foreign students will not be succumbed to the same Payroll taxes which are so crucial for funding of our Social Security.
