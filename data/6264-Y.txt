Jack Louis It has been proved that since diverse talents (i.e. scientists, engineers etc.) from worldwide made their contributions to the US for hundreds of years, America could be able to become the most powerful country as a leader in the world after the 2nd world war. As we know, a lot of German scientists as refugees came to us and worked with US native people together to make the atomic bombs for helping end and win the 2nd world war earlier. In this way, the life of countless people was saved. Why now we need to kick the excellent talents out from our country to lose our power just due to their status? In the history of US, everyone was/is immigration. So, it is absolutely necessary to extend the OPT STEM period for foreign talents to let them contribute their intelligence and wisdom to the US.
