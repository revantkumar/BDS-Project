Currently I'm on 17th month extension and it has helped me to secure employment with what skills I have learned from my Masters degree.
I had to struggle with getting employment because many employers in my area of study (which is Civil engineering) are not interested in sponsoring H1-B and they do specifically mention it on their website and it discourages many Masters graduate from applying for employment.
I personally have gone through lot of interviews where the potential employer has made H1-B sponsorship as the hurdle which prevented them from hiring me.
I personally feel you guys are making these rules very scary for employers which will result in, employers not hiring STEM students who are not from Computer Science background.
Please make the rules less scary for employers where we, graduates wont get rejected because of unnecessary hassles to employers.
H1-B Sponsorship shouldn't be an issue when it comes to hiring talent and this should be true for international students who have acquired their STEM degree from accredited US universities.

I personally want this rule to be implemented as this would give a way out of being in a limbo. My 17 month OPT extension runs out in March and by using this 6 more months I can safely be employed without worrying too much or loosing my sleep over it.

So, please make rules simpler and implement this as soon as possible

Thanks
