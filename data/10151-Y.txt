I strongly SUPPORT the STEM opt extension.

For those locals who oppose this, I just want to say: Do NOT blame your inability or failure of getting a job on others. Some international students, like me, also had a hard time looking for a job. But I know, as long as you really put effort in improving yourself, you can always find your way no matter how many competitors are there!
