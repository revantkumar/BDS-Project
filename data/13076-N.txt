Why would the American government pass a rule that gives job priority to foreign students, exempt from paying Social Security and Medicare taxes, over jobless and underemployed Americans? This is an outrageous rule that Congress has not passed. It is not representative of the wishes of the American electorate and it is a decision, in effect, to help dismantle the American economy and the U.S. republic. This is BAD POLICY and it is unconstitutional. Do not make this decision!
