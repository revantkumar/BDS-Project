Dear Mr. Johnson:

I write to you regarding the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. I am an International student at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). Around 60 % of NJIT graduate students are international students and a vast majority of those are in the United States on F-1 visas. I will be strongly affected by the Proposed Rule.

I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPTS period for STEM majors. Im particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months. I am planning to use OPT after graduation.
OPT and OPT extension is important to be because International Student do hard work to learn many new and important theoretical stuff to get theoretical knowledge. So it is important to apply that theoretical knowledge into practical operation and this is only possible via OPT extension. 

I am very concerned with the possibility that my STEM OPT Extension might be disrupted by recent court actions, upcoming court actions, and delays in this rulemaking process. I commend DHS for working quickly to prepare this new Proposed Rule.

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule and thank you for all of your hard work in keeping America safe and providing educational and training opportunities to F-1 students.

Best Regards,
