I strongly support this proposal for the following couple of reasons:

1. The government should let the students who gained knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.. Many of them are actually really excellent students and are well encouraged by the spirit of U.S.. And they are very willing to make contributions to a wide range of areas, especially in science and engineering. 

2. Diversity is an very important factor for the U.S. . People are working with outstanding people from all over the world, and learning from each other's different cultures and concepts. The world in the future will be a global village where people should learn and get used to working or living with people from other countries. Thus this proposal is a very good preparation for it.

3. Moreover, as a well-known immigrant nation, the United Stats can not be the most powerful and democratic country in the world without those outstanding people from all over the world. In the United States National Academy of Sciences, many academician were actually just excellent international students years ago. And now the rapidly developing science and technology in US are promoted by those people.

4. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Competition can make the industry to choose those actual prominent people in that area. And the average professional level will be raised when more excellent people are standing out. Thus an industry area, or even the whole society can not get advancement without benign competition. 

5. For some areas, international students are not taking the jobs and positions away from domestic people just because lower salary. On the contrary, these areas are having a large demand for talents and can not get enough human resource just from domestic people. 

Based on all the reasons listed above, I firmly support this proposal and be sure that the whole country will gain large benefit from it.
