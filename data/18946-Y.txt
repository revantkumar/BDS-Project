The proposal is great for both US citizens and foreigners. Many STEM positions require the employees to work overtime and some works may be dangerous, most US citizens are unwilling to get involve in. And the extension of the OPT could help the US citizen small engineering enterprise owner hire more trained and skilled international students to support their initial business. After 24 months, the foreign workers have to leave but the US citizen owners have already established great companies with the assistant of the foreign workers. Then the owners can hire US citizen workers with high salary. 
In conclusion, foreign students are willing to accept the very difficult jobs with low salary to help the small enterprises. And when they leave, the enterprises will be able to offer much more comfortable STEM jobs to the US citizen workers with high salary. Those situations will be win-win games.
