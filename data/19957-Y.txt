I strongly SUPPORT this proposal. 

Competition leads to innovation. Protection leads to indolence.

A lot of the opposing comments are talking about the government should give opportunities to US citizens instead of STEM students. Think about it, those arguments are not valid at all. What do employers care about when they are hiring people? Do they care about the race or ethnicity? I don't think so. What's important to them, is how much profit employers can bring to the company, how smart they are and how well they work. They give opportunities to people because they are hard working and smart, not because they come from US or any other country. By simply decide to offer opportunities to only US citizens and expel all the smart international students, company hire a person because they cant find a better one.
