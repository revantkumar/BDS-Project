The Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 found the program full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.

The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'
