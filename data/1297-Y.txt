I'm totally in favor of extending the training period for eligible STEM F-1 students. 

First of all, this regulation doesn't grant citizenship to any F-1 international students, but allows some highly-skilled studnets to be legally trained and work for the US economy at a relatively low cost.

It just seems like a waste of time and money to send these valuable intellectual resources back to their home countries right after the graduation, without allowing them to contribute back to the United States when they would if they worked in US for a limited period of time.
