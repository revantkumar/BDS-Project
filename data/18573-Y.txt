Keeping talents in the US workforce by offering them additional time to experience practical training is an important way to keep the US workforce competitive. Protectionism is never the solution to domestic economic and social problems. On the contrary, allowing US trained foreign national to work, serve and pay taxes in the country will help boost the economy, create values for the society, and promote healthy relationship between the US employers and the foreign nationals. Upon their return to home countries, these US trained professionals could potentially booster trade relation between the US and their home countries via the connections they establish over the Optional Practical Training period. Allowing an extended OPT time is a win-win situation for both US and the foreign students. In particular, graduates from the STEM field have been providing value to the US economy over OPT time by working in tech companies, academic institutions, and other companies that are in urgent need of such talents and could not replace the foreign students with US citizens. Letting these foreign talents go will only harm these companies, harm the US economy and workforce, and result in a brain drain that will eventually affect the everyday life of US citizens. The world is a increasingly interconnected place, and we are enjoying the benefit of this integration in the form of new iPhones, efficient Google search engines, better cancer treatment options, etc, that are partly contributed by these foreign nationals who work in the US and develop these technological advances. Let's keep them here and work for this country for as long as we can, and not be so short-sighted and hurt the US economy and global technological leadership in the long run.
