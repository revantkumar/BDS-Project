Victor Chang OPT extension for STEM students is neither helping them fulfill their american dreams nor killing the job opportunities of Americans. Instead, they are creating more benefits which leads to more jobs due to the fact that there will be more international cooperation because of their international background. America is a nation working on human equality. Former STEM students have been contributing so much for the states, I believe those who are about to graduate will do the same thing in the future. I just want to say, we are Creating rather than Replacing.
