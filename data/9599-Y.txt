Excellent international students are providing strong workforce to US companies and institutions. People must be treated equally for job hunting since justice is one of the United States spirit. 

As we all know, United States is a country with various nations. Brilliant scientists and engineers from all over the world come to here and devote themselves in research or industry. That surely and straightly lead to a stronger nation and helps to improve United State's overall national strength.
