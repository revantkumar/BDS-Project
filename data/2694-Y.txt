I strongly support this regulation because of two reasons.

First, this regulation will attract more international talents to attend institution in U.S. Without this regulation, many of them will decide to stay in their home country or other welcoming countries, which is a big loss for U.S. We will lose thousands of talents who will contribute a lot to our tomorrow's technology. And they also pay a lot of taxes which will benefits our welfare.

Second, I agree that U.S. citizens will get higher chance to get a job if this regulation does not pass. But a strong country does not live with short-term benefit. The reason why our country is the strongest in the world is that we own the most advanced technology and most smart people here. The history tells us long-term benefit always overweight short-term pain. This regulation will keep our country in the first place.

Therefore, I strongly support this regulation.
