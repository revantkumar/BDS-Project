I am an international student and pursuing master degree in US. I absolutely support with this extension. This OPT extension is for STEM foreign students who have achieved high education, and can definitely contribute a lot to the American communities. Many people here misunderstood one thing is that STEM students like us are not ones who steal jobs away from US citizens. We are high-educated, equipped with high-tech skills. Many of our jobs are way well-paid than the average. We are contributing to this country. Even many high-tech companies couldn't hire enough qualified employees. So stop saying that we are given less-paid jobs and make you unemployed. Truth is if this extension is not approved, a lot of high-tech companies will lose many great foreign workers, which is a disaster to not only the whole industry, but also the economy and development of technology in US. Make the wise choice please!

High tech companies creates opportunities for other industries. For example, Uber creates opportunities for drivers. OPT students are essential for High tech companies since High tech companies usually can't employ enough engineers from native citizens

Honestly, I do think many international students plan to return to their home country after several years in U.S. It is important to gain the working experience in the U.S. before we return back to our countries. Without the working experience in the U.S., we lose a competitive strength comparing to other employees when we return to our countries. Several years working in the U.S. we may consider return back to find a better occupation in our own counties. There is no worrying about occupying job positions for U.S. citizens since some of us may not want to stay in U.S. permanently.
