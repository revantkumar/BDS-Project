I strongly agree with the extension of OPT, because it helps people to realize their dream , and eventually make the USA turn into the ultimate biggest winner.

OPT is the key factor differentiating US from other destination countries for international students. It attracts the world's smartest minds to strengthen Corporate America. Those global young talents fuel US's innovation engine, keeping its leading position in STEM field.

The extended OPT plan BENEFITS not only the international students, but also every US citizens. I found that most of the negative opinions focus on the point that international students would threat American workers. However, I disagree with this opinion from the following three aspects:

Firstly, with the help of international STEM students technical companies have created numerous values, which in turn are converted into tax revenues. Without those students, the American GDP would be greatly influenced. 

Secondly, they need not to worry that the international STEM students would impair their jobs. On the one hand, international students can only work in the companies that support H-1B sponsorship. On the other hand, companies would always prefer native students if they are equally competitive. 

Finally, those who blamed for this plan should think more about how to improve their own skills and knowledge. Most of the international students strive hard for their future, but what about those who have no skills but still complain a lot?

So, all in all , the Extension of OPT need to be passed.
