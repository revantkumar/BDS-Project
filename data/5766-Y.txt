Why cancelling the OPT just because Americans can't find jobs? Does Americans afraid to compete with international students? Company only hire those skilled international students, not every international students. Why? Because they can do a better job than Americans. It is them bring value to the company. It is them contribute to American's Economy. 
You want to cancel it because you are afraid to compete!!
