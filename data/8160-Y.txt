I strongly support the extension.I am the cousin of a Chinese STEM student. My cousin is applying for the American college so he would contribute nearly two hundred thousand dollars to the US university during his four years in the America. United States is his favorite destination as United States is offering a unique OPT system which allows the students to practice what they learn in the practice. If this policy is revoked, I believe my cousin, as well as many foreign students, would not choose united States as their destination. This would be a great loss to the United States and its economy and college.
