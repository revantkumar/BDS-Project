Michele Putnicki The proposed rule for expansion of the Optional Practical Training program would be devastating to American tech workers. It allows U.S. companies to hire foreigners who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would depress tech worker wages. There is also a perverse incentive for employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or the market wage. I believe that U.S. immigration policy should serve American workers.
