Xu Chen I strongly support the OPT extending policy because of the following points.

1. Historically, the United States has been being a nation of immigration, a nation of survival of the fittest. The overwhelming majority of the country are immigrants (or descendants of the original immigrants). It is these generations of courageous, hardworking, talented foreigners who build America to today's superpower.

2. By rationality, foreign students deserve the right to have sufficient time to apply their knowledge and skills acquired from school to real-world practicing and get their working experience gained.

3. Foreign students who can get a job in America in a short time have to come from the top level of the intellectual hierarchy, forming the group that will literally create more benefits to US science, technology, industry, economy, society etc. The OPT extension will give foreign students bigger chance of continuing to work for US afterwards.

4. As mentioned at the beginning, this is a world of survival of the fittest. There is no way that foreigners "take" natives' jobs. People get jobs only because they are competent for them. Native people who originally have a (decent) job will still be in their position even with foreign competitors; those domestic people who originally do not have a (good) work will not get (a better) one even without foreign competition.

Look forward to the approval of this rule.
