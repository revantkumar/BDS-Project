This is getting ridiculous. My son and my boyfriend have been out of regular (more than a few weeks a year) employment for several years now. They are not included in the number of unemployed because they have long since been able to collect unemployment. One of them was told by the VA, they are both vets, that they should look to relatives to help them out. My income is finite. They are both over 26. They receive food stamps. They are not eligible to be my dependents. Charity begins at home. When are these businesses going to hire American citizens first?
