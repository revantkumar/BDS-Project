I believe this is a good measurement to strengthen our country's edge by encouraging talented students working for America instead of going back right after costing our education resources for 2-5 years. These students are not taking American's job. They are mainly in the field that Americans don't want to touch. It's a win-win. One thing USCIS should be keep an eye on is that to make sure this is not abused by some shell companies, especially IT companies (like they did to H1B).
