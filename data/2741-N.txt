Every time the government allows foreign people into this country for whatever reason, they always end up staying because the same government that let them in won't make sure that they go home when their visa is up. By allowing these guest workers stay after they have learned their information, it is costing all of us the tax dollars that they don't pay. We need to help our own citizens learn theses trades & reward them with jobs. NO more foreign worker taking our jobs.
