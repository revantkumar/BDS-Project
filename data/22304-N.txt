I find it extremely difficult to support any program that is taking jobs from US citizens and giving them to immigrants within our borders. They are here to receive an education meant to 'improve their countries conditions' but are being drawn into corporations (Disney is a superb example of corporation greed) which take financial benefits due to faulty government programs. Just how does this assist their own country? Supposedly these 'students' are already trained. If that is true then why should they be allowed to remain rather than return to their own country & improve their own countries conditions?

Additionally, those 'employed' under this program pay NO SSI nor Medicare which further denies US citizens the additional fees this would generate. These jobs should be given to qualified US CITIZENS!!! There are already 98,000 persons under the 12 month program with an additional 30,000 under the 29 month program. That totals to around 128,000 jobs that should be filled by qualified US citizens with the SSI & Medicare payments adding to the countries programs.

There are numerous points that have been posted which support a complete elimination of this program rather than even keeping the present deferral time frame. So, I wish to suggest that a complete elimination of ANY extension should be proposed! In other words, I STRONGLY support Sen. Grassley's position along with the addition of ELIMINATION OF THE PROGRAM!!
