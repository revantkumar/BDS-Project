I vote for this proposed rule. 
First, I lived in a small town in Missouri, what I see is that international students are contribute greatly to our economy. We are building more houses for them to rent, selling more cars, and opening more malls and restaurants, despite a decent amount of tuition fees they paid.
Second, I don't think this rule is placing international students over US citizens. It simply allow our employees to recruit either US citizens or intentional students. And I do believe US citizens are as competitive.
Last but not least, it's true that we might have to spare some of the jobs to international students, temporarily. In the long run, if our companies are recruiting the elites from worldwide, keeping our technology top of the world, I believe this new rule will create much more jobs. A good deal, isn't it?
