I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international computer science undergraduate student from China.Before I came to US, I was studying in the Top 4 university in China. When I decided to transfer aboard,I multiple options to transfer in US, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and British, etc. Lots of great countries. But I choose US. 

It is not only because I believe US has the best and advanced education in the world. The most important reason is that, US could provide me the real-world industry training during school or after graduation through OPT. This is the most significant advantage that US has compared to other countries. Without this, I believe the foreign students would decrease significantly because most of us would not scarify the opportunity to gain the industry experience that we could have in our homeland. Admittedly, China have good education and is emerging country. An US university diploma are not attracted as it used to be. 

OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents, for example, Australia.

Its definitely a huge disaster to most high-tech companies - which are the support for US economic growth. And with the decreasing in the foreign students number, the consumer industry will be harmed. Foreign students are important consumer for boosting US economy because of their great consuming of luxury, real estates.

I think the opponent should argue other immigrant policy but not this one, because to some many aspect, this one does good for US and foreign talents.
