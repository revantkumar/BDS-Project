Rui Kou I am an Petroleum Engineering student, and I think extending OPT to 36 month would be extremely beneficial to US oil and gas industry. 

And I would like to give one strong support for my opinion. 

Recently, US people has been enjoying the benefit of cheap gasoline price due to the booming of shale oil and gas in United State. These unconventional resources were not considered recoverable until the technology has advanced in the field of directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing. As we all know, graduate engineering students (especially Ph.D) students are the major contributors of all technology innovations. Among all the graduate engineering students, at least 70% of which are international students. When the international students graduates, they aim to work in the research department of the cooperates. 

Imagine, without having international engineering students working in the research department, the technology required for shale gas booming would be delayed for decades, where US would still be relying its energy to OPEC group members like Saudi or even Iraq. 

Extending the OPT to a proper length, give a chance for both international students and the cooperates to choose each other properly, which would be the best situation for US technology development. 

As a student from developing country, I can clearly see that the strongest power of US as a developed country, is the leading position in engineering and science technology. Having a policy that works against international students, will definitely loss the leading position gradually. Therefore, I strongly support the extension of OPT for engineering students.
