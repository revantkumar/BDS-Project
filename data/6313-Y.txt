I support this policy 
Because only a few student with the US citizenship would major in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). But high-tech companies need a lot of employees to work. If F-1 Nonimmigrant students could not get expanding training opportunities, it would be hard for high-tech companies, such as Micron, Sandisk, to hire ideal employees. Electronics industry would collapse due to lack of excellent worker. And this would have a negative influence on US economy.
