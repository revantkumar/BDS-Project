I think the best for USA to get maximum benefits from International students in the field of technology is to allow them to work for maximum time in USA. I have few other options for the same.

OPTION 1:

OPT PERIOD of 12 months

OPT Extension of 48 months

H1B Sponsorship - No facility to provide sponsorship

OPTION 2:

OPT PERIOD of 12 Months

OPT Extension of 36 months

H1B Sponsorship - Eligible for the same

But basically the STEM extension should increase from 17 months to minimum of 36 months. This will not only help US companies but also create many jobs for local Americans in field of healthcare, hospitality etc
