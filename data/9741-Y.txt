I am strongly in favor of the proposal since it it clearly beneficial for both Americans and international students studying in the US.

I was originally from China and I came to the Stanford University to pursue a Ph.D. in statistics with scholarship four years ago. I was the best student in my college and so were many of my fellow international students. We all came to the US to receive a better education, and we hope to give back to not only the US but also to the whole world. We are the future of the generation, and working in the USA after graduation will not only benefit ourselves, but also benefit the US economy and even the world economy, and thus creating even more job opportunities for Americans. 

Talents are the most valuable resources. USA has attracted the most talented students here, and why would the USA want to drive them away after providing them with the best education? We should all work together to increase the total number of job opportunities, rather than treating the total number of job opportunities as fixed and discriminate against international students. We are here to help, to give, to contribute. And we would certainly appreciate a welcoming attitude through the OPT extension.
