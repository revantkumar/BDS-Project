I am strongly opposed to extending the time limits of the OPT program and even to retaining the program at all. I ask you to revoke this proposed rule. I am a member of the STEM group of American citizens and I am personally hurt by these policies. I've been working in the technology field for 30 years and my income has been flat to lower for the past 20 years. The biggest problem is my long-term UNDERemployment as I can no longer find full-time work due to so much competition from outsourcing, H1B visas, and now OPT.

It's not lost on those of us living in the Silicon Valley area that President Obama and now Hilary Clinton make monthly flights to San Francisco, disrupt the traffic of the 'little people' on their motorcades to the homes of the Silicon Valley super-elite, collect checks at multithousand-dollar-a-plate dinners, and then motorcade back to fly away with the money and the political interests of the technology corporations' CEOs in their grimy little pockets. (At least Joe Biden would stop at an ice cream shop and say hello to the regular people.) Then of course we see the results, like this proposed extension of OPT to 36 months. The profit interests of the CEOs are addressed by the President while the working American citizen is left unemployed, underemployed, or underpaid. This is IMMORAL. The health of America and its citizens should not be for sale to Silicon Valley CEOs.

Please revoke this proposed rule. With Democrats like this in the White House, there's no reason not to vote Republican next year.
