It is a definitely great rule. The economy of United State relies heavily on the advanced technology. Those technology companies contribute a lot of taxes every year. In those companies, many employees are international STEM students, and they start working with OPT. OPT gives companies the opportunity to hire more good employees and it also gives graduates the opportunity to find a good company. With extended OPT, those excellent graduates can work more time in the companies and contribute more for the companies, even if they cannot get H1B. Otherwise, after the companies spend so much time and money training them, they have to leave. It is absolutely loss for the companies and so is for the economy of US.
