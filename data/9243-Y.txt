As parents of a Chinese Ph.D of science, we strongly support the rule of expanding OPT for 24 months. Our reasons are as follows:1)these talented students of of STIM have been working hard for several years completing their degrees there in the USA. Some students are paid by their parents for their education while some, like my son, are paid by American instructors for their accomplishing of their degrees. We really hope our son would make some contributions to American economy in return for the efforts made by his instructors and meanwhile gain some opportunities for practicing what he has acquired. This rule will benefit both American economy and the students in that these students will fill the job vacancies in the fields that have urgent demands for professionals and by working there for 2 more years, these students will gain more working experience which is an important and necessary part of their educational experiences in the USA. This rule will attract more talented international students to go to USA for their advanced studies, which will also contribute to American economy. It's believed that in America, everyone enjoys equal opportunity and this belief is what inspires and attracts the talented people all over the world. That accounts for why America is now the most powerful country in the world. The American open and down-to-earth attitude towards talents has always been a drive for making the nation friendly, dynamic, strong and tolerant.
