I oppose the Department of Homeland Securitys proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. It is just not fair to American students and workers because this rule actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students as they dont have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens. This rule would make it more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.
