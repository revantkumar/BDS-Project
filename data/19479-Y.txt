Extending STEM Opt to 24 month help U.S to keep more talents. U.S. has spent so much money and resource on education, it is huge waste that U.S. give little chance to these intelligent students. If there's no OPT extension, a student who graduates on Feb doesn't get any chance to apply for a H1B visa which opens application since April. 24 month STEM give them 1~3 chances to gain working visa and prevent U.S. from losing these talents. Don't forget, STEM students are not only intelligent and hardworking, they also bring cultural diversity to U.S.
