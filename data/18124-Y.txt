Students graduating from US University with STEM degree are the most ideal candidates to contribute to America's tech industry. Making sure they able to get the necessary Visa to get job and continue their career here is essential to ensure the knowledge they gain gets used towards strengthening the nation's industry and economy. Students who study in US university for 2 to 5 years also are more likely to assimilate in american culture than immigrants of other categories. I believe this is a step in the right direction and I completely support it.
