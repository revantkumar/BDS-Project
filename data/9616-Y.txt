I think Expanding training opportunity is really a excellent way to better facilitate both student and the industry. It will have a practical range of time for student to work and contribute to the industry. Many of the student now suffer from too short OPT time thus choose to apply for H1b when they actually plan to leave after a couple of years. Have extend of 24 month would give those student the flexible to actually choose whether they even need h1b or not. This will properly split people who want to do just OPT and people who want to work for a long time. Therefore unnecessarily competition on h1b will be able to be avoided.
