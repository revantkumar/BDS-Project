My view is that, development in science and technology is key to economic progress of this country. It keeps America as a front runner in many aspects. To keep this momentum, America needs great talented personnel in STEM field. 

Individuals with outstanding talent from all over the world comes to America to be part of this great development and make an impact in this world. Universities and research institutions nurtures this talent and grooms them. They help students to gain immense knowledge in their field. The hope here is that one great scientist or a doctor or an engineer can create a big domain which can create thousands of jobs for all. 

Foreign students who really want to contribute to this country and community need to follow various immigration rules. Often, it's extremely hard to get work visa before their student visa expires. This is due to limited number of visas. STEM personnel who couldn't get a work visa usually goes to their home country which is good for their home country. These personnel would start working for companies of foreign countries which would pose immense competition to American companies across the globe. This is hampering growth of U.S companies resulting in less job growth here. 

STEM OPT extension is a stop gap arrangement for few months and it's not a permanent visa. So, I feel that, this would help retain the talent here. This short extension may not cause any problem for citizens in growing economy.
