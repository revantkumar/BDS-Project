Those who oppose this regulation, you think you're saving your job, but you're killing more. Europe and China's economy is falling, why do you think US can stay up? Where do you think all the innovation to keep this country up, or leading this information age's pace come from? US embrace all the hard working people and give them opportunity to build a better world, I can't understand why those who were born in this country want to prevent people contributing their power. 

I think the new regulation is a good start, for fighting this global economy challenge. Winter is coming, and don't be the boy that "killed" John Snow.
