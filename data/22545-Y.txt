It continues to be obvious that the US government and the various economic forces which it appears to be influenced by do not have the best interest of the country as a priority. The proposed regulations and the underlying laws have not been approved by Congress and for this reason, it is questionable as to whether making a comment opposing the changes in regulations will have any impact. It is of obvious conflict between the economic support of higher education provided by the government and private sources is highly negated for those who are diligent enough to complete the study and make sacrifices as US citizens only to have their efforts set aside for those who are not part of the US citizenry. This sends a clear signal to the citizens that they are not first class or first in priority and are not sought to become productive members of society. No wonder the system isn't working.
