These year, getting H1B became much more difficult and extending the OPT time can decrease the pressure of international students like me. I came to US because I admire the technology here and want to join and work for the best tech company. But now, it's really possible that I cannot achieve it and has to go back. I believe everyone can see the contribution that international students did in the society. Extending the OPT time means we can have more time to use what we learned in this country to serve people in this country!
