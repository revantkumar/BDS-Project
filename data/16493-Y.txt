I strongly support extending the OPT period to 24 months, actually, I think the longer the extension period, the better the policy. Those students with STEM degrees actually are the key ingredients and boosters for the US economics and high-end techniques. These students work in companies like Applied Materials, Intel, Microsoft, Exxon Mobil, Apple, Facebook, GE, General Motors, Texas Instruments, Linkein, Boeing, Google, Oracles, PTC, Microchip, Analog Devices, Freescale, Synopsys, Cadence, Mentor Graphics, Coventorware, startups like Airbnb, Uber, etc. Some of these students are really talented that they work in very front-end researches in companies that no one else can replace. I guess United States don't want to lose these talents. Also, those foreign students with STEM degree actually presents the diversity of the company; they stimulate company growth, they enforce colleagues learn from people from different backgrounds, which is why nowadays US still manifests itself to be one of the most innovative countries and leads the world in many different fields.
