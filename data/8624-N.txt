Another example of the Government's deceitful subsidy and expansion of useless programs. Eliminating American workers from the labor force. Adding nothing to the American safety net of citizens needing assistance. Whoever designed this program should be fired. We the people are getting smarter about Government by the Government instead of the People. This is truly a good example of that. I as a voter will continue to educate my friends and neighbors of the hazards bestowed on us by the Federal Government, and encourage them to do the same.
