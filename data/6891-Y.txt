As an US citizen, I have to point out that this is a good news for the whole country. Some of the people may think that this visa extension will cause American to loss more job opportunities. However, as a tech worker, I know that the growth of the economy deeply related to the tech company which has lots of foreign employees. This visa extension will help this companies to hold more talented candidates and will finally benefit our economy.
