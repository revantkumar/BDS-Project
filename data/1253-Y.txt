I strongly support the new 24 month STEM OPT rule. Because it is usually required at least 3 years, which is proved by the new STEM OPT, to train a qualified STEM worker.

STEM OPT provides a sufficient time window for STEM students to get after school 
training. 1 years practical training is really too short for training a college
graduate to be a qualified engineer/scientist (compared with the 3-5 years 
residency period of medical school graduates). I saw some comments say that they didn't need any training when they graduated in the 1950s and 1960s. All I can say is that after several decades, there are too many new technologies that you can't learn from school. Several years of training is essential for STEM students to become a qualified engineer or scientist.
