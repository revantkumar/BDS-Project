US needs a larger tech-savvy workforce to maximize economic growth
400,000 stem students from 200,000 by 2015 (Doubling of STEM graduates)
At rate of $200000.00 per student for 2 year degree with tuition and graduation fees, staying expenses and other education revenue the US is receiving ( Total $80000000000.00) will go other countries with OPT system. 
US Universities and colleges will be badly affected if the OPT Stem extension is not retained and expanded to 24 months.
Most of the US Universities and colleges will shutting their doors if the OPT extension is not given, because student will choose other countries for higher education 
Students will contribute to the growth of US Economy by paying the Taxes on their employment ( 3 Years x $3000 per year x 400000 students= Total $ 3600000000.00). 
Total Benefit to US Economy Benefit in the range of $ 83600000000 for 5 years
Students will contribute to the growth of US Economy by innovation and research in their field of study (Example Solar Energy, Medical Research)
Best practices from employers/industries can be reached to the Universities
Without practical training the education for 3 years will not prove to be beneficial to the students (Ex: mobile- android/iOS development)
Students acquire skills and specialized knowledge in their chosen studies ( Ex: Cancer Research, Stem Cell Research, Nano technology)
In developing countries the OPT is not available and that is why the students come to US.
The curriculum and syllabus of the various Universities are fast changing to changing technologies in STEM
The employers will be getting the top notch brains and new energy filled students who can bring benefit to the company by the new developments science and technology and IT ( Ex: BIG DATA in IT, Social Networking, Mobile technology) otherwise relying on obsolete technologies
The new rule proposed will help that it will not affect any US based existing employees as they are covered under the provisions of new rule prot
