The rule proposed above would allow students to put their knowledge into practice for an extended time period. The lengthened OPT extension for STEM programs would allow graduates sufficient time to build a strong foundation in their careers. The formal mentoring or training plan proposed would ensure that all employers strategically train and assign responsibilities to allow these graduates to meet the current market demands in business and technology. The extension of the operiod of unemployment during OPT from 30 to 60 during the OPT extension period would provide relief to students who are in search for employment or are in transition between two employers. In a nutshell, this is a great initiative from the Department of Homeland Security to encourage students to pursue education and career training within the United States of America and gives a wonderful boost to this STEM economy.
