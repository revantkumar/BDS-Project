I strongly support this proposal. 
1. American dream is not American legal residents only, as the strongest country of the world, it need to be more comprehensive. Everyone deserves equal chance. International students want more time to practice after graduation. 
2. It is good for economy, companies have more choices to hire talented foreign students especially science and math areas.
