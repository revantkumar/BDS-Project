Basically, these people with high educated STEM degrees can help American to improve American economic, education, and technology. 

As we all know that most of American do not like Math and Science. However, the US is competing with other developed/developing countries all the time. Without doubt, STEM majors play a crucial role in the competition. 

I see most of American are worrying about their jobs. That is because they do not know that the international students with graduate degrees in STEM majors can only get a job in their high skilled area but not competing with majority American. If they realize the significance of foreign graduate students in STEM majors they will also be supportive.
