I strongly support OPT extension! International students in STEM could benefit both STEM industry and US universities. If the OPT is not extended, a lot of foreign students will not come to US. Currently the tuition fee received from foreign students is a huge support for US universities. If they could not get any internship or jobs, they might go to other countries and US will lose this tuition fee. Students from abroad added approximately $24 billion to the U.S. economy during 2012-13 school year, according to US news.
