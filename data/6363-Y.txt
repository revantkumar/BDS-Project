I highly support this new STEM OPT Extension policy for the reasons listed below:

1) International students choose to come to US not to countries like UK to complete their higher education for an important reason that US allows the students to work in US after their graduation. For STEM areas, no doubts, US is the leading country in the world. Our study on the most advanced technologies should not be limited on campus, the experience we gained in the high tech companies in US definitely will benefit us a lot in the future career. Without the OPT extension, within such a limited time of only one year internship, how could we actually learn something in the company? We may be asked to leave the country when we just start to get familiar with our projects, our workload, our colleagues, and our company. International students pay a lot of money to study in US which definitely help the universities to maintain and upgrade their education quality. It's unfair that just kicking them out of the country after they graduate for a little while. This is not the thing a country who focuses on the rights of human beings should do.

2) It also hurts the high tech industry if the OPT extension is cancelled. Just like I said earlier, most of the new employees will go through training process in their first year in the company. If the newly trained employee is not allowed to continue working in the company right after they received the training when their OPT ends, it causes a huge human resource waste of the company. The company spends hundreds of thousands of money to train an employee who are not allowed to benefit the company. How will the company think? It would be very challenging for high tech companies to face this horrible outcome of the cancellation on OPT extension. It will largely prevent the companies from developing to a higher level. In this case, how will US continue being the leading force in high tech in the world?
