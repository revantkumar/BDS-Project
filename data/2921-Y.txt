I strongly SUPPORT the OPT-extension for the reasons listed below.

1. Why do you send these students who have consuming lots of education resources from universities back to their countries?
2. The U.S. job market needs these well-educated and well-trained students to contribute their expertises. 
3. The quota of working VISA (H1-B) is ridiculously less.
