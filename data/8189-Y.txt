I strongly support for this OPT-extending regulation.

1. This will be a great economic benefit to US. The new regulation will attract more international STEM students which are in high demand in job market. Many object views state that this will make Americans lose job. These statement are not correct.
1) Not too many Americans would like to learn STEM majors. There is no direct link between OPT extension and losing job
2) STEM graduates are already in shortage. If US gov can't pass this new regulation, the whole economy potential of US will be worsen.

2. Right now, many high tech companies have many employees that are in OPT status right now. Denying the new regulation would be a huge impact for US.

3. In the long run, this regulation will benefit the whole US. Stop being shortsighted.

4. US is a country with immigration culture embedded from the very beginning since 1700s. If people even with advanced knowledge and skills are not welcome here, then where will US stand in the next 10 years?
