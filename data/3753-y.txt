Aleksei Witty Well, a friend suggested me to comment something in this registration so I will comment.

I do not mind with this amend. This change will enable me to see more students from different countries with common interests: science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Not only this will improve my personal interest in international students, but this change would make a greater purpose for the STEM OPT as well.
