I do support the OPT extension rule. It will help students in developing skills by applying their academic knowledge in practice. Currently, due to limited H1-B quota and inadequate OPT duration, students prefer working for big companies that can afford to file H1-B visas in shorter time. The new rule will make start-ups and small companies as attractive opportunities for fresh grads. It will not only help the big companies, but also provide enough time to small companies to hire fresh grads and file H1-B visas for their employees. Overall, it will benefit all STEM-based companies and boost the economy.
