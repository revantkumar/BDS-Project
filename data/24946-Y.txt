For those who object this proposal, please think again the loss and wins if so many high-tech immigrants are leaving the country. They came to the US to learn and get trained on the cutting edge technologies and they are specialist when they graduate. They master the most advanced technology in science and technology. They were able to make it here because they are outstanding in their fields. Why do you want someone so well-trained to leave instead of working for us? They work hard and have good morality. Why do you want to set barriers to the US economy?
