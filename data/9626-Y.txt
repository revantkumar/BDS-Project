I strongly support this proposal because I am a CEO at a start up, and half of my employees are from China, while 2/3 of them are using OPT to legally work in the U.S. They have made a great contribution to the company and the value of the company doubled last year. New grad students especially these international students are hard working and clever, so the IT industry need these young people to change the world. So I support this proposal.
