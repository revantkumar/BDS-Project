As a STEM graduate student, I highly support this! Not only simply because it will give more feasibility for my career plan after graduation; but also it highly increases the chance to keep more talents that could help build the growth of the country. And of course, people come to this country hope it will get better and better! Keep the most talented young people should be the first thing to do!
