As a employee in asset management industry, I undoubtedly support this proposal not only because of the following reasons: First, America experience extreme shortage of specialists in data science, machine learning and so on, and international students who learned those expertise in US should have the chance to make their own life decisions. More importantly, lower the cost of hiring high-end specialist in STEM helps america's economy. Also, diversity and culture respect is very important for America's civil rights foundation. If the international students have the ability to find a job, means that they have brought extra value for their employer companies. Finally, it also save the potential problems for illegal immigrants, which might create extra trouble. All in all, it's a policy that almost benefits every party in US to make the US a more peaceful, fast growing, progressed society.
