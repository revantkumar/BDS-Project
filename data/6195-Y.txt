Shaobo Tian OPT extension for STEM student is definitely good thing for this country.

Firstly, the top companies in US need more intelligence employees to support their products and global growth. If the international student can not stay in US, they will leave and work for other companies in other country. It will be a big lose for US to maintain the best students.

Secondly, since the STEM students will comparatively get a higher payment, so they will spend more money in US, like renting a more expensive apartment, buying more clothes in mall. Since they live here and have money, other US citizens can get benefits from their consumption, which will also help to provide more jobs for other citizens in other field.

On the other hand, I don't think it hurts other US citizen STEM students benefits. The companies in US never stopped hiring tech jobs, they never worry about that they are too many good candidates and they do not know who to hire. What the companies worry is that they can not have many good candidates. So, US STEM student will never lose their jobs because of international student.

As a result, US citizens will never lose jobs because of international STEM students. Instead, US citizens will get more jobs because of the high consumption of international STEM students.
