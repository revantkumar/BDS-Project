I'm a recruiter for a data science research team. I strongly support the proposal. Every year we hire statisticians on the research projects in our company. It's so hard to find statisticians with good match and we mostly rely on foreign students with doctorate degrees in top universities. Without the OPT extension and Cap-Gap relief, it will be impossible for us to hire the right people to do the work.
