I strongly support the proposal due to below reasons:

1. International students indeed made great contribution to America development specially in tech and economics fields for recent decades. Most of them work as principle engineers, scientists and analysts (some of them are even famous CEO or CIOs in the fortune 500 companies i.e. Satya Nadella) to make sure many American companies to achieve their profits goals for years even computer science, math, physics and etc. are not the majors which most American students like. Due to the greatly incremental development in tech fields, many companies build multi subsidiaries across the country to provide more job opportunities for US citizens i.e. Apple is building a second largest office in Austin to offer more than 3,000 job opportunities.

2. Competition does exist somehow. However, this kind of competition is able to motive most of domestic students to become more competitive. Domestic students don't need sponsor, don't have to learn English as their second language or don't need to take some time to adjust to American culture which give the domestic students obvious advantages to find a job compared to international students. 

3. Authorizing international students to work in US for a while significantly demonstrates diversity of US which is critical point to keep America be the most powerful country in the world. This is helpful to America to understand the real circumstances in other countries much clearly.
