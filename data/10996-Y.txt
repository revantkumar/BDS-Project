I support OPT extension rule.

U.S. leads the world by the advantage in STEM. Expanding training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students, chances are U.S. companies can hire more qualified employees, and this is the only way to keep companies more competitive, providing even more job opportunities in the future.

Kicking out all F-1 Nonimmigrant Students in STEM, possibly qualified employees will be lost and get employed by foreign competitors. How could US companies in STEM keep leading the world? If so, probably no job opportunity can be provided by companies then.
