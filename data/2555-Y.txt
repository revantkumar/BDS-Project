I support 24month OPT extension, my reason writes below:

Firstly, 24month OPT extension increases the chance of foreign elites to stay in US, who made great contribution and will continue to make contribution to the country.

Secondly, only 1 year OPT is not enough for companies to use foreign employees, excellent employees leave after 1 year because of failing in H1B lottery is a great loss for the company. Rehiring people after one year gives burden to the companies. 

Thirdly, 24 month OPT extension brings positive competition which encourages everyone including locals work much harder to fairly compete in the job market.
