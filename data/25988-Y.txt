I SUPPORT this new proposal on expanding opt for stem f1 students. Those who believe the new proposal places foreigners upon us citizens, must NOT work in a high tech company, and thus do NOT know that the majority of high tech workers are us citizens. I believe having us citizens as the majority and talented foreign students as the minority in the same company is a win-win game.
