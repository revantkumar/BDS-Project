I agree with the extension for training opportunities for F-1 non immigrant students with STEM degrees. I am Ph,D student Major in material science and engineering. Though learned a lot from my Ph.D studies, I still feel that I need to gain more experiences especially in industrial area. With the expanding training opportunity, I would be able to gather the experiences I need to fully utilized my skills and knowledge.
