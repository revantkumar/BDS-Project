International students are around 10 percents in U.S. top 100 universities. Many of those students are not in STEM majors. And many of the STEM students are not interested in staying in U.S. How can the 10 percent international students cause U.S. 100 percent problems in society employment? 

According to my and my friends' knowledge, more than half of the master and PhD students in research centers of U.S. top 100 universities are international students. In many cases, 90 percents of the student in those centers are international students. Is it wise to throw away more than half of the researchers after they graduate by not giving them enough OPT time?

The OPT extension can help U.S. attract and maintain excellent STEM major students from all over the world. Science and technology is the core strength of a country. It is very crucial to national security and global economy competence, so that many countries are trying very hard to attract and nurture students that have a gift in science and technology. The fundamental reason that U.S. can lead the global economy and politics is that U.S. has the best scientists and engineers. But this leading position can be lost if U.S. finds itself short of intelligence.
