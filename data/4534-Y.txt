I was an international student and now i am working as a electrical engineer in Apple Inc. OPT extension provides me the opportunity to continue work on designing great Apple products. I see many talented engineers in apple who rely on OPT because the quota for H1B visa is far away from sufficient. I am hereby comment here to support the 24 month OPT extension. Thanks!
