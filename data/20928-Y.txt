I strongly SUPPORT the proposal:

1. Diversity is crucial for the U.S. A lot of international collaboration are contributed by nonimmigrants, most of whom were international students;

2. Competition is a fair way to ensure improvement. Nonimmigrants are hired because employers can not find proper citizens to fill these positions.
