I fully SUPPORT the OPT extension.

Any one who has read even just a little American history knows that America is nation built based on the efforts of millions of immigrants. Even most of the so called "American citizen" were merely the descendants of immigrants. Now looking at their comments of objecting the opt extension, I only see the growth of their laziness and unwillingness to work hard as their ancestors. Now they just want to lie in their couch, drink beer and watch football games, forgetting all the benefits brought by the hard-working foreign students. 

The fact is that in this new era, lots of American citizens choose not to work in STEM based industries. However, the STEM industries are the ones that really keep America ahead of other nations in the world. If this opt extension fails, the American companies will lose their chances to catch up with new growing force (e.g., China, India) and further lose the good benefits to its own citizens. The strong growth of American industries is actually the results from the efforts of countless STEM people (mostly composed of foreign students and the workers they later become) over years. Yes, there will be competitions, but all for the goodness of this nation.

As one of the STEM student, who is NOW contributing a lot with my intelligence to the development of technology of this nation, it is really sad to see that my effort are not recognized by the so called "citizens". And I really hope this extension is approved. The STEM people who are really contributing more to this nation deserves a better chance.
