How about we use these resources for the student who IS NOT going to turn around and leave the States to use their learned skills? Is it that difficult to help those AMERICANS who would love to go to school or go back to school, but can't due to already built up student loans while illegal aliens are receiving free benefits? Time to wake up and take care of your fellow AMERICANS who want to succeed and not take advantage of the system that you have cleverly created.
