I strongly support it. It's very important for the graduated students apply their knowledge to the industry, which should be a part of the study. One-year OPT is not enough. As the new graduates, most of us don't have any working experience. We have a longer learning curve. We need to spend a lot of time to get familiar with the system and operation of the company. Then we can really get into work. We really hope that the OPT could be expanded.
