I totally appreciate this move by DHS as this would help the foreign students to have more time before they get the work visas. This would also ensure more foreign students registering for schools in the states compared to other destinations like Canada and UK. Employers would benefit from this as it ensures no foreign student leaves the country in a short duration after being employed due to visa issues and hence can focus more on the business.
