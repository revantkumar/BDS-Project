Come on!I LIKE THIS ONE!! I mean, if you couldn't find a job, that's your problem. It's a shame to blame on your Chinese or Indian Classmates only because they are smarter and work harder! STEM programs get more and more international students, the only reason is ourselves are too lazy! Such a SHAME to blame on them!!
