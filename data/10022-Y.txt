I strongly support the extension of OPT for F1 students. Both US and foreign students would benefit a lot from this regulation. 

For US, it would improve the competitive power of the country as those STEM students are highly trained and talented young people from all over the world. They work innovatively and can completed difficult projects. As fewer and fewer american students choose STEM as their majors, US society desperately need more STEM graduates as "human capital" to keep the country competitive, especially in science and industries.

Nowadays, foreign students and scholars make great contribution to the country. For instance, Elon Reeve Musk, the founder of SpaceX and a co-founder of PayPal, and Tesla Motors, is born in South African. Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, joined the company using his OPT as an international student from India. They managed to make those high-tech companies thrive, creating more jobs for US people, paying for taxes to keep well-fare to all American citizens. 

US need STEM students. They can get the toughest work done and help to make America a great country. They would be turned to American citizens someday and create thousands more jobs in return.
