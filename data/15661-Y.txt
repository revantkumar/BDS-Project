I strongly agree with this proposal. 

Nowadays the need for skilled worker in STEM is rising. The proposal allows more skilled people contribute to U.S. and also contribute their knowledge to the research and technology. 

Many International students did make and still keep making huge contributions to U.S. This proposal will definetely benefit U.S.
