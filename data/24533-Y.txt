In my opinion, extending OPT training period for another 24 months is very important to economy of USA. In silicon valley, there is a great number of F1 students who are well trained and very smart. They make a lot contribution to great companies like Microsoft, Google and Facebook. The high growth of silicon valley cannot happen without their help.

If this proposal cannot be passed, there will be thousands of F1 students being forced to leave their companies, which is a huge disaster to US economy. Therefore, everyone who care about US economy rather their individual interest should firmly support this proposal.
