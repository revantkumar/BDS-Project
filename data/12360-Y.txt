Whoever thinks it is in America's best interest to eliminate foreign talent and foreign investment is simply naive.

Five years ago, my department (civil engineering) had a slowly declining enrollment because not much new construction was happening in our country. The university was set to cut off the entire department. In response, we opened our admission to foreign students. Turns out civil engineers are in great demand globally. All of the foreign students (mostly from Middle East, Asia) did not mind paying out-of-state tuition to get the best education in the world. With their tuition and enrollment numbers, we were able to save our department. 

Where do you think your kids scholarship funds come from? At least in our department, we charge them a high tuition so that every one of our American students can enjoy tuition benefit, scholarships, fellowships. In reality, it is them who is paying for our kids' education. For that, I applaud my department's creativity to bring the foreign students and their deep pockets here!

I know other schools that are opening campuses around the world, and sending professors overseas. This is what you get if we do not allow them bringing foreign student. The schools send our professors to them. I would rather to have foreign students here, and let them pay for my kids, and keep our good professors in the country.

So, I support the OPT program. We need their money so our schools do not go bankrupt like this country.
