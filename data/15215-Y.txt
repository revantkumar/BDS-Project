Kevin Indyk Personally, extending OPT for STEM students could attract excellent students from all over the world to America. The long-term impact is that it would boost America's scientific and engineering power, strengthening America's leading position. The concern about less employment positions for its citizens seems unnecessary to me, because the number of H-1-b visa is still unchanged. The OPT extension would give the US government the freedom of choosing the most brilliant students to serve America.
