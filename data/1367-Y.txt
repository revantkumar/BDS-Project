The original purpose of OPT is to help international students to polish their skills after they graduate. The extension period allows us to practice more before we go back to our homeland. The benefits of the extension for both the States and students are significant:

1. Extended OPT attracts more international students to attend universities in U.S. International students contributes greatly to U.S. economy, and universities' financing. he number of students will decrease dramatically if the extension has been eliminated;

2. OPT extension will NOT threaten local employment. Most OPT students have no immigration intention, and will go back to their countries when OPT ends. In addition, the number of students who can stay depends on H1b openings, not OPT;

3. Great benefit for employers in U.S. Most STEM positions are filled by international students, as there are not enough U.S. students majored in these areas. A reasonably-long OPT gives employers a lower turnover and decrease the pressure of HR department. International students are usually underpaid, which is good for local employers, too;

Comparing with these significant benefits, the withdraws are minor. So we wish to see the extension, which further helps the economy and university funding of U.S.
