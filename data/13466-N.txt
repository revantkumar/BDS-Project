Hell no!!! there's 2 things everybody in the used to be Good Ole U.S.A. has to do # 1. pay taxes and # 2. Die. why would you exempt anyone from paying taxes Even Jesus had to pay his fair share of Taxes. These Countries need to take care of theirs, Obama better think about this before he does something stupid like maybe take away a job from one of his own girls unless he doesn't plan for them to get an Honest American job. This is why Pittsburg isn't the steel city it used to be and our own factories are closing down Heck Obama don't have to worry about retirement money. We need to keep every penny in our own pockets since they have stole and ruined our Social Security. Stop the big shots in Washington from wasting our money on stupid projects. I'm sorry but You hit a nerve and Americans need to stand up for ourselves . everything should be voted on. One more thing Why does Fla. even have to Vote for President since they didn't even count them in the Last election.. My Wife has a friend that came from the Philipines legally and she had to learn English and pay taxes and pay to get here. and my Wife and I both have Arthritis and still work. I'm 59 and she is 49. Stop kissing everybody else's Ass. If they don't like America they can gladly LEAVE people from India already own every convieniance and liquor stores in Fl. Everybody here should be made to speak English. Thanks for your support , I can't contribute at this time because I don't make $100.000.00 a year to stand around and waste Taxpayers money go to a state or Washington meeting once or twice a year and spend our money for a $ 1000.00 a plate Dinner,. I'm struggling just to make normal bill payments . Please let some Senator or even the President read this.
