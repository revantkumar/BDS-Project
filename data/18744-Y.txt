I strongly SUPPORT the STEM Extension for the following reasons.
International students learned from the American education, it is profitable for USA to let them use what they learned to contribute the USA society. 
Nowadays is a global business, American companies need employees with different international background, which can help the companies to learn other countries or markets, make them competitive compared with foreign companies.
Freedom and Diversification are deeply rooted in American spirit. And STEM Extension really reflects the Freedom and Diversification.
