Please make sure to raise H1B quota for F-1 Graduate students.

Would suggest to mandate use of H1B visa by International firms during same year the visa was approved. I have seen many employees from IT Firms coming to the US after 1-2 years from the date their H1B visa period starts. This really frustrates F-1 students working on OPT / OPT STEM Extension if their visa doesn't get picked up in the lottery. F-1 students have limited number of chances to apply for H1B during their stay in the US. International people described above jeopardize F-1's chances to get H1B.

Please look into the matter.
