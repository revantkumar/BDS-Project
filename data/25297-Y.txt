I believe that this regulation will a play strong positive factor when it comes to retain more young talents especially those work for tech industry where employers right now desperately searching for qualified candidates. Because everyone knows that hiring the right people are the number ONE elements in being successful in these fields. And that's why this nation still stands at a leading position worldwide: She has so many brilliant people work and live here. The new rule precisely resonates with what this country truly believes: Those who are smart, hard-working and with integrity should have the opportunities to make this land a better place. Thus I fully support this new regulation and following ones of same kinds.
