I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

First of all, the U.S goverment should the the interational students who learn knowledge from the U.S university stay in the country and apply their technology in industry, and keep making contributions to the U.S.

Secondly, diversity is very important in the U.S, different racers of people working together is a part of democracy. Colorful is beautiful, furthermore, many international students make a very big progress in their field.

Plus, some people may think that the international students take a lower salary for more work, which makes the citizen don't have a job. I think this comment is not fair to the international students. Some job position maybe just better fit for international students. Yes, the competition do exsit, but it is actually not a bad thing, competition is just make industry grow better, no matter the competitors are international students or American students. 

In my opinion, I strongly support the propsal.
