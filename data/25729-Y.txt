I strongly support the proposal. It seems to only benefit those foreigners, but actually it benefits citizens as well. The current situation is, not all people want to stay in the United States in the long run. However, for different reasons, they might want to gain some experices here. A longer opt not only gives them the option, but also make them less eager to get a H1B, not to mention a green card.
