Extending the STEMS not only help F1 students who would love to work here to hone in on their professional skills, but also a lot of benefit for US society since the majors of the talents included in STEMS are what US is scare. Furthermore, most F1 students spend 3 years even 10 studying here and did much efforts to learn the language and culture, trying to melt into the US family. They are supposed to have more opportunity. So definitely yes for this regulations.
