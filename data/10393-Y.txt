Candice Ou I agree that we should extend OPT to two years longer, which will give international students three years in total to apply their knowledge and contribute to the United States. Universities in the United States have attracted a lot of students from across the world because of their advanced technologies in many fields. Students will spend four years to explore their passions and they will need more than a year to get hands-on experience. I am really grateful that my company provides with me a chance to apply what I learn into the actual industrial environment. My company has spent months to train me so I do not want to leave the company without dedicating two more years to a time-consuming yet beneficial project. I will need to make my project mature enough before I hand it over to others so they can make progress on a solid foundation. From my working experience, I have met many passionate and helpful Americans, who have taught me how to cooperate with others and impressed me with the their open-mindedness. I realize that it is the acceptance for diversity that builds the United States into a vital country. I feel lucky to have your kids or parents to be co-workers and I would like to spend two more years with them and keep the precious friendship even after I go back to my home country.
