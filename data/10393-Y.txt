21st century is a fast development century, a country owns the most number of talented people will win. Will US wants to stop appealing talented people from the world? No. But stop STEM OPT extension will. If US stop providing STEM OPT extension, then all students in all fields will only have 12 month to work in US. And due to H1B capgap, less and less students will actually get H1B to continue working in US, which explicitly result to a brain drain. And the talented students major in hi-tech will flood to other countries, potentially strengthen the power of them. 

More over, given this, less and less students are willing to pursue degree in US because they have leave immediately after they finish their study, which is also bad for US education. We always want to attract more and more skilled people to work here to help build American. In this sense, the disadvantage is much less than the advantage. I think we have think carefully. Will the International students really affect our own child? I think they only make our children better students better citizen. Because they have the most excellent competitor from all over the world. Otherwise it would make them not work hard. Because jobs are so easy to get. 

Think twice before we act, our children have many International friends.
