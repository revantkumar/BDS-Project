Why is US the No.1 in the world? Because it has the greatest people in almost every field.
Why do talented people around the world come to US? Because it has good policies.
OPT extension is such a good policy that attracts talented students around the world who will build the future!
Think about the impact and long term result that would bring to the US if there is no OPT extension!
If there is no OPT extension, some really talented students can't continue to work in US anymore! Moreover, top US universities will be less attractive for international students. In the long run, US may lose its first place in some areas!! For example, it may be surpassed by China in IT industry because some greatest software Engineers don't choose to come to US anymore simply because of the policy!
