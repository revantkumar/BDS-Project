(4. The OPT program runs contrary to the purpose of non-immigrant student visas.)

A longer OPT period is viewed as a means to give more chances to apply for an H-1B visa that in turn allows applying for immigrant status. This is reflected in the comments made by many aliens in support of this regulation. E.g., ICEB-2015-0002-0962 ("12 months are usually not enough to successfully apply for a H1B VISA. Therefore, the extensions are extremely important."), ICEB-2015-0002-1384 ("I am supporting for OPT extension to 24 months for STEM. It will help us to our next step of getting H1B Visa. Currently H1B is going through lottery and it is really difficult and un-predictable that we will get through in one attempt."), ICEB-2015-0002-0824 ("I completely support STEM extension 17 months or more(24 months) because this will allow students to get job & apply h1b 2 times during that extension period."), ICEB-2015-0002-2636 ("It is a very good rule. Can increase the total chance of the international students getting a H1B visa."), ICEB-2015-0002-3698 ("A lot people will be able to get another chance to win the H1B lottery and get to stay in US for a longer time!"), ICEB-2015-0002-2870 ("The longer STEM students are allowed to stay in America, the more opportunities they have to obtain the H1-B visa and remain in America, working at American companies helping them grow and succeed."), ICEB-2015-0002-4007 ("If new rule extends opt-extension to 24 months, international students have much more chances to try H1B lottery."), ICEB-2015-0002-0811, ICEB-2015-0002-0590, ICEB-2015-0002-1466, ICEB-2015-0002-1467, ICEB-2015-0002-0366, ICEB-2015-0002-0592, ICEB-2015-0002-1089, ICEB-2015-0002-1188, ICEB-2015-0002-5546. Clearly, many aliens are coming to United States on student visas with the intent to remain permanently, in violation of the terms of their visa. This proposed rule aids such aliens in their unlawful purposes.

The volume of such comments showing that aliens come to the United States intending to violate their student visa attestation that they intend to return home should cause DHS to reevaluate the wisdom of allowing work after graduation. 

DHS is transforming the statutory authorization for admission "solely for the purpose of pursuing [] a course of study" into "for pursuing a course of study or hanging around long enough to get an H-1B visa." In particular, the Cap-Gap provision of the proposed rule serves no purpose than to assist aliens, who are supposed to be here solely for the purpose of study, to remain in the United States in violation of the terms of their admission.

5. The proposed rule will make it harder to get H-1B visas. 

While many commentators perceive the proposed rule as a vehicle for getting an H-1B visa, the actual effect is to make it harder for anyone to get a visa. Creating more opportunities to apply for an H-1B visa without increasing the number of visas available simply increases the number of visa petitions, decreasing the likelihood of any particular petition getting approved. At least one other commentator pointed out this problem. ICEB-2015-0002-5815.

6. Educational Purpose

As the comments by OPT participants show, the program has limited (if any) education value. In reading through the comments, I was unable to find any comment where someone described how the OPT program is related to a course of study or is a means to achieve specific educational goals (beyond just being able to get work experience).

7. Industry has no expertise to establish mentoring program.

It is commendable that DHS has recognized that OPT currently has no educational purpose by requiring the establishment of a mentoring program. The problem with DHS's proposal is that mentoring programs for new graduates are rare, particularly in technology fields. DHS is telling employers to set up a new system that has never existed without providing any guidance on how these mentoring programs are to be set up. The likely result is that employers will just go through the motions to provide whatever paperwork DHS requires without going any further.
