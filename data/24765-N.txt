The obvious is that this administration is out of control and is totally against the American people. 
There is not one thing this president has and does that is for the good of our own people.
I'm 66 years old and it pains me to see where the liberals/socialist are taking this country.
First God and then country - is what I proudly stand for. It is stated that even God's people will
suffer for lack of knowledge. So I sure pray that we the people stand up to the lawlessness
and the hate for our country. I'm tired of seeing our cities and towns turn into looking
more like Mexico or another country.
Don't tell me that we need more foreigners trained or given our jobs and more opportunities
because we Americans do not want to work. Don't tell me the illegal aliens do the jobs we
Americans will not do when I was a migrant worker from the age of 8 to 19 years old.
We need to take our country back by eliminating the sits of all those politicians that disrespect
or hate this country.
A proud Hispanic that hates to hear Geraldo Rivera and la Raza to say all Hispanics want illegal
aliens in our country. All Hispanics I know are against socialism and this administration that
are against the greatness of this country - our country!!
