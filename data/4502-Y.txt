I absolutely SUPPORT the proposal. Education should be fair, foreign students should have the equal opportunities during their learning process. Training opportunities are an important component of college education. US education is phenomenal in the world, but if the government can not provide students the opportunities to apply their knowledge to real business, it would be doubtful that the education is as good. Education is not lectures or homework at school , education is the transition from knowledge to the ability of using the knowledge. That said, training opportunities are not optional, but necessary. For STEM students specifically, they need longer time to learn how to apply the complicated technology to real work. 24 months extension is an understatement. Thus, we need to think about this proposal from an education perspective. Education should be fair.
