I strongly support OPT extension regulation, for the following reasons:

1. U.S. is in short of *HIGH SKILLED* STEM workers, such as people with bachelor/master/PhD degrees. Having a rich repository of great people is critical to U.S. economic success, and growth in future. All those STEM students consist of a great part of U.S. STEM workers (and future working force). Therefore, ending OPT extension regulation and force all those great people to go home is definitely a bad move.

2. OPT and OPT extension is *PART* of university education. The reason for having OPT extension is because one year is too short for any training in STEM fields. For example, at Google it would take at least 6 month for people to being able to produce good work after all those internal training. Therefore, I believe OPT extension regulation is based on real needs and backed up by many U.S. companies.
