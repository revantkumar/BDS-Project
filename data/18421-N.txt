As a family of ALL STEM workers, I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the 
Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to
3 years and also, avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay.
