The U.S. enjoyed its most successful and prosperous history with the strongest upwardly mobile middle class during the time of the least immigration. It is time to rethink just how many people we can allow in the U.S. and to focus again protecting our shrinking middle class and offering real and positive options to our growing welfare class. Increasing foreign work visas and high immigration levels is a detriment to legal U.S. citizens. At what point does the U.S. start to put its own citizens first? At what point to we realize we cant take in massive numbers of migrants and not have an extremely negative effect on our farmland, natural resources, and wild lands? When do we start to use analytical reason rather than knee jerk misplaced empathy? For every job created, we increase those competing for that job with our own unemployed or underemployed. Please explain the logic in this reasoning. I ask that we curtail completely foreign work visas and migration until the U.S. has its national debt under control, our environmental issues addressed, and our workers given first chance to provide a secure future for their families and the U.S.
