I strongly support the proposal. The reasons are below:

1. The F1 students have already lived in US for a few years and learned knowledge and skills in US universities. It's reasonable for them to apply what they learned in US university to make a contribution to US by working in US for some time.

2. Diversity is a highly regarded value in US. With those F1 students from different backgrounds, creativity, which mainly comes from the interactions of diverse cultures, is easier to achieve and bring US more benefit, both in academia and industry. In fact, many top scientists in US are international students before, like Prof. Xiao-Gang Wen in MIT (http://dao.mit.edu/~wen/), one of the top researchers in condensed matter physics theory in the world. 

3. Most international students do not compete with US citizens for jobs. Instead, most of them do work which most US citizens usually do not choose, like fundamental scientific research. These researches are important for the US to keep its leadership in the world in the future. Therefore, the extension of OPT for STEM majors is necessary.
