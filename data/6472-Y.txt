We all know that the high-tech industry is one important pillar of the U.S. recovery. These high-tech companies, like Google, Apple and Intel, all benefit a lot from the joining of many brilliant international students, who are selected from the best high schools and universities all around the world. If we just stop extending the OPT permit, many smart students have to go back to their home country and cannot serve the U.S. companies more, which is definitely a big lose. 

What's more, the OPT permit is very important to international students, for they can learn a lot from this training. The OPT is one crucial reason why they choose to be here rather than the U.K or other countries. If we just only offer a 12-month OPT, it will be much less appealing. Then, gradually, the U.S. will fail to attract the best students from the world, which could bring very negative effect to the American education and research system.
