Really appreciate all the work done by Homeland Security Department! The extension of OPT of international students with STEM degrees is crucial to both students who are seeking job opportunities and companies which are seeking people with STEM skills. Longer time means higher probabilities of getting working visa as the lottery system is getting more and more candidates. Also, companies have enough time if their employees do not have the luck to get the working visa. This would largely save the cost of the company. 

The extension is also beneficial to U.S. At this critical period of new economical structure, keeping up with fast growth of tech industries is very necessary.

I hope this proposal could be in effect as soon as possible! Thanks!
