I greatly appreciate the proposal. 

I know I can't complain much. But all we asking for is the equal right to be employed, to be acknowledged and to get a career one deserved. Stem extension may be of little meaning to others. For us, this is something that may potentially change our life and get a job we've been fighting for.
