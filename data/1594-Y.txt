I write to you to share my opinion on OPT STEM extension . I strongly support OPT STEM extension because International students studying in USA boost up their skills practically working here for two year's as one year is too short for people to get relevant knowledge more over international students studying in USA are involved in most of the research work and it will be an added burden for the companies to loose people in the middle of their research.
