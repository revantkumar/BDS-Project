I am a postdoctoral scholar at University of California, San Diego, and I am doing the fundamental research in nanoengineering material science. My current OPT will expire at the end of January 2016. Without OPT extension, I may have to stop my current research. 

I graduated from University of Florida with a PhD degree in December 2014. I have spent almost one year in my current research project from US government. For the fundamental research project, postdoctoral scholars like me usually need two or three years to produce significant research results. We have to spend the first year to learn about the research project and to develop the method to solve the problem. The progress and research publications will come out in the second and third year. For example, I am doing a study on interfacial structures in metal alloy for the development of new materials with better properties. I have developed a simulation method in the past eight months. However, I need additional one year or two to apply the developed method in the practical industries. Without the OPT extension, I have to stop my current research. Then, the time and resources invested in the first year will be wasted.

Therefore, the STEM OPT extension is really needed for postdoctoral researchers like me to make significant research progress.
