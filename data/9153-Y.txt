Students practical training opportunity must be directly related to the previously obtained STEM degree

The following is a suggestion to change this rule to A student with a previously obtained STEM degree can qualify for the STEM degree extension. Since, a student with a bachelor degree does not typically have the same master degree. For example, a student who obtained a bachelor degree in computer science went to work in the field, and then he or she decided they need more education to gain better experience. He or she went back to graduate school and got an MBA. Now they work for a company in a management position, not related to his or her previously STEMS degree. Changing this rule to include all previously STEM degrees regardless of the current occupation will give a better opportunity to students to apply what they learn, while giving employers the opportunity to diverse their workforce with well-educated employees.
