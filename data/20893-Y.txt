Being an immigration country, the charm of US attracts foreign students. As a result, the skills that foreign students keep are continuously changing this country and let the US remain leading role in the current world. Once OPT extension is discontinued, those talented students will go back to their own country and enhance the development of those country instead of the U.S For a matter of fact, the majority of students come from India and China. Both countries are growing in fast pace over the recent years. Even if OPT extension remains, the number of foreign students who are willing to stay in the U.S will decrease dramatically in the future. Hence the strategy for the U.S government should be to keep more talented students to contribute to the society rather than to let them bring their skills to their home country. 

The people who complain are always lazy people who want to enjoy without hard working. If those people's voice dominate, then the U.S will lose its competence soon. Being in this world, if you work hard, you may not be the best, however, if you don't work hard, you'll certainly lose. Does the government want a bright future for this great nation or just want to make the lazy people happy? I know you already have the answer.
