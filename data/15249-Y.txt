As a officer in Bay Area, I strongly support this policy. There many smart international employees in my company. They are smart and hardworking and got at coding. Only USA can attract so many foreign students in all these countries since we are open to every culture and every kind of people. If this policy can't pass. Many companies like mine will suffer from recruiting and workload because many international students may not choose USA for further study and even they get a degree at USA, they can't work legally. The fact is, we can't recruit enough employees if we can only choose from American students since many of them are not willing to be programmers.
