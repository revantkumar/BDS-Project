I strongly support this proposal.

1. The students who learned knowledge in US universities should have the right to make contributions to the US.

2. The US is a country which welcomes people from all over the world. Diversity is very important for the US.

3. The students can make contribution to the employer as well as to the US. 

4. The US need more work force in the science, engineering, Math, etc area.
