I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Cisco. I firmly believe STEM extension is extremely necessary for new students as well as Employers. This allows companies to train these highly qualified students and can utilize most of their talent for innovation of new technologies and companies growth. 

The fundamental basis of economic growth if from technological innovation , research and development.Some of the recent outcome of these talent are Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google which adds tremendous amount of value to USA. Providing these students with sufficient amount of time using STEM extension is a good tool to acquire and retain talent.

Failure to do so will result in brain drain to other countries like India and China and will have significant impact on economy in a long run. This also puts a threat of any future competition from those students developing parallel technologies.
