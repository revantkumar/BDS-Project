Norman Dyche We are so worried about foreign students and their performance here. The original programs assisted them to complete a degree, and then return to their own country and participate in its economy. Now we see extending their stay to work here and take American jobs. This program does not need to altered again. They got a wonderful education and 4-5 year stay. Now it is time to go home where your needed and can participate in the economy. We have thousand of college grads that want the opportunity to find and get a job in various communities. Why are we constantly changing college programs to meet the needs of a few. How about our students welfare first!
