Study after study has found no shortages of U.S. native born STEM graduates. Furthermore, STEM job wages have been flat or declining since 2000. Rising wages from a labor shortage would be expected but wages are not rising. 
Expanding training opportunities for foreign born STEM graduates make no logical sense and it seems that special interest are controlling the narrative here related to the F-1 "Immigrant" Student training expansion. 
Curiously, there is no provision in the proposed rule for training native born STEM graduates and incentivizing native born STEM graduates with employers. Also, this rule oddly ignores the most obvious fact, why should foreign born STEM graduates need training to begin with when there already exists native born STEM graduates who are experienced and unemployed?
With news reports of companies (Disney, Microsoft) laying off native born STEM workers and then lobbying congress and the white house for cheap immigrant labor through avenues like this must be deemed fraudulent and therefore this proposed rule should be shutdown.

This "de-facto" expansion of the H-1B is being implemented without Congressional approval and would allow Tech companies to boost profits through labor arbitrage at the expense of the American middle class. 

I oppose this proposed rulling.
