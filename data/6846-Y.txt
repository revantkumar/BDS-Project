I support the new act that expanding the training opportunities for F1 students with STEM degrees to a total 36 months. A lot of international STEM students study and get trained in the nation's universities, especially in graduate schools pursuing PhD degrees. The new act would help to attract those talented students remain in the United States after graduation and apply what they have learned to a practical work in their fields of study.
