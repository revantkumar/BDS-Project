I totally agree with expanding OPT for International student. Because a lot of STEM students are actually doing a lot of technical jobs like ITMechanical Engineers that native people don't want to do. And they actually have made great contributions to the technical field in U.S .Thus it is unfair to cancel the expanding of OPT!
