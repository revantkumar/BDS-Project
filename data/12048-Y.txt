The extension of training opportunities are win-win policy for both the F-1 students and the U.S. itself. First of all, it gives more options and time to all the students to work and learn in the OPT time. Students can take an intern or work as full-time. Also, it's beneficial for U.S. The undergrad or grad students from best universities in U.S. can bring lots of intellectual resources and relatively cheap workers for industries. And if the U.S people believes in the free market idea, why not let the industry choose which employers they want to hire, and instead try to set up so many obstacles for international students? If you think about why people are afraid of giving international students more opportunities, though they still don't have the same opportunity as the native people, does this mean these people are thinking that they're not as qualified as the international students? If so, why not just try to improve yourself to be better qualified and to compete? I believe this way will create more benefits for the society as a whole. Let the market decide!
