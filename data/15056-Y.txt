I would like to express my support for DHS for proposing this new rule. I believe the extension will allow the workers who have expertise of interest to US to stay here for a longer period and is absolutely necessary as it allows them to use the education that they have received, in many cases for free, towards the benefits of US citizens. I also support any immigration reform allowing those who express technical superiority to stay in US; otherwise, they will essentially receive free education and training in US and use it elsewhere which is absolutely non-defendable economically.
