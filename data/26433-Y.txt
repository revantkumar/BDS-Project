I am against foreign students studying in this country. They should not be allowed to stay in this country after they graduate if they are allowed to go to school in this country. They overstay their visas and the US gov. does not have the resources or the will to track them down and get them out of this country. Too many US workers are out of work or their wages have gone down.
