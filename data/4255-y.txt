Clint Hall YES. Increase immigration 100%. Students 100%. Revise the IRS to increase taxes. Give priority status to the immigrants 
that are willing to work. Give the employers the right to fire non immigrants to make room. Cut S.S. to non immigrants to help 
offset the cost. This is just a few to start. I'm sure the greatest leader in the world,( master Obama,) would be greatly pleased.
This would give his destruction agenda a boost.
Have a great day.
