From my perspective, OPT extension largely helps America's education system. OPT extension will attracts lots of talented young people around the world come to America which brings a lot of innovation and stimulates America's economics greatly. This will provide more jobs in a long run. America is a leader in Technology and education all over the world. Limiting OPT or any foreign talents will impact it's role heavily. Please take more consideration on this.
