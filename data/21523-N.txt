I'm from Boston and won't forget how one of these jerks blew up our marathon. Why is our government intentionally putting Americans in harms way? What happened to our rights? It seems illegal aliens have more rights than citizens these days. Did you all forget the oath you took to protect American Citizens? We are really getting fed up because you make bad decisions and then expect us taxpayers to pay for them. Again, what about our rights?
