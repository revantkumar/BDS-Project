Hi
I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS RULE
The USA is an immigration country! This is also a good opportunity for companies in America which need international student who has expertise in STEM area . A rejection of this rule will compromise benefit of these companies.Also rejection on this rule will directly decrease the number of international students and many American schools might close due to the decreasing of international students.The lost of international student will reduce American universities income and this might lead to lay off of many American teachers and researches.
