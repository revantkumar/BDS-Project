This is great. Illegal workers get the jobs and our HS kids have nothing to make money. Yes, I know a lot won't work for the lower wage because their parents have enough money. Wages on middle class people haven't gone up but food, and utilities have. They are hurting and their kids would work if there were jobs open to them. Illegals should only be hired after all legals are employed. I know that Congress and the rest of the government are being taken over with the Marxist and we are no longer the wonderful free country that we were. That could be changed if their was a coup and everyone of them were thrown out of the country or put in prison. I have 3 children 7 grandchildren and 2 great grandchildren. I am a 3rd generation American and have been proud of our country but that is changing. I wouldn't have had children if I knew this was going to happen.
