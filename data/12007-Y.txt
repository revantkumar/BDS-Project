I strongly support this proposed rule for OPT extension. I read through some of the reviews, especially the negative ones. Sounds like we Americans think ourselves not as competitive as the internationals? If not, why don't we welcome international students in the job market? We should keep in mind, it's the diversity that makes America America. We should welcome international ideas, especially from STEM students with skills, to keep our advantages in technology and economy in the world. So, please, do pass the rule, and don't send those students trained in US to our enemies.
