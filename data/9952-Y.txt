I support this rule as it is very important for the students specially who are doing Masters in United States by paying fee and gaining world class knowledge. All this knowledge they get in such universities should be given a chance to be applied in US itself. It will help them retain excellent talent and also help STEM fields progress in USA.
All students who spent money to do MS in US should not be solely dependent on a lottery system of H1b visa, rather should be given a fair chance.
Also, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.
