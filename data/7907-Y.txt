Krishna Sai Sevilimedu Veeravalli I support Optional Practical Training (OPT) strongly and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I'm particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months. I am glad that many people are gaining practical training experience in the US because it adds a lot to knowledge and revenue for United States. I am currently working as software developer and have many international people as my colleagues. They are very smart and intelligent .
OPT and OPT extension is important to be because it adds billions of revenue and knowledge transfer to the United States
