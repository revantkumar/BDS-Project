I STRONGLY support this rule as it helps many international students to further their education and utilize their talents for the growth of the US economy. In my opinion it is a win-win situation and I see no reason to not pass this rule. If this rule is removed, many international students who came all the way to US with many hopes and dreams, who made way too many sacrifices to reach US would be left jobless, their dreams shattered and have to return to their home country. US will also lose many talented international students who are working here and it will be a huge loss to the US economy.
