After viewing the comments recently, I would like to point out one thing. A lot of Americans think that the young Americans under the US education system is smarter and more creative, and all of them should deserve a job, and they should be always employed first. However, a positive, innovative, and a striving society should have competition in the labor market. Only qualified people should deserve a good pay job. I don't need to illustrate the advantages of such society.
Then a lot of Americans would say that OPT STEM would not create a fair job market. With the OPT STEM, Americans have so much advantage in the job market. International students could only get the job if they are more skilled or they would get a lower salary. I understand that some company would exploit this and pay the international people much less, but international people have choices: they could find opportunities in other companies or other countries or go home. This is a free country! I believe that people should have a choice to work for a lower wage if that is the only way to achieve their goal. No one is FORCED to work for a lower wage. 

The people who are against OPT STEM will still oppose it even when all companies are closely monitored to have fair wage to international people, because these Americans think the ONLY reason of unemployment of Americans is because of the foreign labor.
