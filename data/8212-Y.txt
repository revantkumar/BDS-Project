OPT extension policy can provide american company more opportunity to develop.
First, these international students who pursue a degree in USA will contribute themselves greatly to the company who can provide them a position that can stay in USA. Their talent and skills will help these companies develop a lot. 
Second, the longer OPT extention is, the more benefits the USA companies can get. For example, if the OPT extension is 12 months, the company will have to hire another candidate to fill this position after the first employee leaves after 1 year. They need more training and money to train a new employee. This is a waste of money. If the OPT extension is 24 months, they ony need to train a new candidate after 2 years the frist candidate leaves. There is no doubt that it helps save a lot of money.
In a word, I support the USCIS's decision to extend the OPT extension for F1 Nonimmigrant students.
