Usha Mohani Kavirayani I strongly feel that it is necessary for the extension of the OPT period for the STEM courses. This can hugely impact the development of the country as there are many International students working for various organizations and are quite familiar with the work environment. This sudden change of OPT period can affect the working environment of an organization and can sometimes loose a good employee which will in fact effect the economy of the country. Hence I support in improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 Non immigrant students.
