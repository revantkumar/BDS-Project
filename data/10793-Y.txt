"Learn by doing", as parents of F1 student, we all think valuable pratical STEM experience is so important for the academic studies, only four- year study plus one year OPT is not enough. 24 months extension is really reasonable! 

And mean time students also will contribute their new knowledge to the society, this is a WIN-WIN solution.

Please make this regulation approved, thanks!
