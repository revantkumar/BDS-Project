Deepak Venkatesh I am glad that I am given a chance to comment on this proposed 24 Months STEM OPT Extension rule.

I love contributing to innovation and American Economy. Hence, I love the proposed STEM OPT Extension Rule. I strongly believe 24 months is required for an international student to acquire necessary practical training after his/her graduation. In this regard, I strongly support the proposed 24 months STEM OPT Extension Rule.

As an International student and STEM graduate, I like to see this rule published and implemented without adversely affecting the 1000's of Highly Skilled and Highly Motivated students in F-1 status who are contributing to U.S. Innovation, scientific discovery, technology improvements and U.S. economy.

Best Regards,
Deepak Venkatesh
