Weiwei Song I strongly support this proposal, for two reasons: 
(1) 12 months OPT is not enough for a fresh graduates to be well trained to. Be able to contribute to their employers, consider the time and resource.a company has to spend on a new hire, if international student has to leave the job after 12 months training due to OPT expiration , that would be great loss to majority American company thus to American economy ;
(2) nowadays the chance for a international student to get H1-B lottery is very low, especially when they only have 12 months OPT which means there is only one chance for them to even try for the lottery. A lot of talented people who have knowledge and technical skills needed by big companies will have to leave U.S.A if they did not get the lottery. It is no longer a place for international students to pursue American dreams by working hard, since only lucky ones who get the lottery can stay here. The lottery has nothing to do with their abilities.
