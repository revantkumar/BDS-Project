I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training Program. This program was designed to allow foreign STEM students opportunity to gain practical experience and on the job training in their field before returning to their home country. Instead U.S. Tech companies are using the program to hire foreign workers to circumvent paying their share of payroll taxes, which is about 7.65 percent of the employee's pay. Foreign students who work for such companies must violate the terms of their F-1 visa, which requires them to leave the company after getting their degree. This program creates an incentive for U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students and exploit them by paying them far less than the prevailing wage at a time when multitudes of qualified U.S. workers cannot find jobs in their field after graduation. This program was never authorized by Congress in the first place. It has served only to pad the pockets of greedy businesses and politicians at the expense of the American worker. It is a complete myth that there is a shortage of STEM workers in the U.S.
