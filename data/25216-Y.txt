I absolutely SUPPORT the proposal for the new 24 month-extension of STEM OPT. Maintaining diversity is very important for a society. Only by enriching the diversity can this country absorb the essence of various cultures and maintain diverse public voices. And the exchange of ideas and thoughts is good for the U.S. and eventually good for our human beings. Diversity of cultures can also prevent biased or partial collective opinions and behaviors in this country.
