Poornachander Komatireddy I strongly support the proposed rule. As all of us know, the major income source for the U.S. is IT. We, the international students work harder for the U.S. and we definitely are major contributors in the country's economy. If the U.S. had enough skilled workers, it would never hire the people from other countries. I guess people who have love on the U.S., who don't want the U.S. economy to be destroyed and have full knowledge on this rule would definitely support it.
