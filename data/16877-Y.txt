I have over 30 years in the IT industry over a decade with some of the largest software companies in the world. I have managed H1B VISA holders, pulled them off projects and even hired one to sponsor his green card. I've managed off shore projects and on shore. First there's no shortage of IT talent when I was laid off in 2013 every job I applied for had dozens of applicants some over 100! Second these people are often hired with vastly lower salaries and they have no recourse. They are also in many cases given little if any expenses they are told to do it with the low salaries. As a result many live in over crowded apartments and share cars. If you want to see how this system is abused then look at the recent case at Wright State University where they sponsored H1Bs for a contractor that paid well below market salaries. We don't need these workers they will take American citizens jobs and continue to push salaries down. Thank you.
