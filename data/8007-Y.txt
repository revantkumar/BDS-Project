I support the proposed rule for improving and expanding the training opportunities for F-1 Non immigrant students with STEM degrees. United states of America has always been a country that welcomes students who are in pursuit of excellent higher education and it has also been the place many technological advance. An important part of education is to get the sufficient and adequate training where in students can learn and get the best experience in their respective fields. Just getting the coursework done is not the complete education. With F-1 students getting sufficient time to get training in their fields, not only will that make more mature as a professional when they return back to their country but will also help the American economy to benefit from their training experience.

So, I support to improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 students with STEM degrees.
