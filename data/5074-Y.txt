Qiwen Dong As an international student majoring in science, I STRONGLY SUPPORT this rule to extent OPT for F-1 STEM student for the following reasons:

1). For STEM students, getting your Master or PhD degrees does not mean you accomplished the full training. 5 years of education trains you as a capable learner but you still need to seek more opportunities to exert what you have leaned and that unfortunately takes longer than who else majoring in other fields. So it is really important for us to gain valuable working experience here in the States after graduation and the extension of OPT could definitely provide more opportunities as well as promote the job hunting process.

2). We international STEM students can largely benefit the technology as well as economics of the United States. Brilliant ideas arise when disagreement collides. Our culture and education background provide us with distinguishable aspects of view and capacities that could together with native citizens boost the development of technologies and sciences in the States. No need to state the contribution to STEM field made by international scientists/technicists in the past decades.

3). As an open country with a high diversity, the United States provides precious educational resources to the students all around the world. All the talented students would contribute to their field as one kind of pay back. Yes, I have to admit that there will be an increase of competition as for the native citizens to some extent. However, competition promotes evolution and that is really how the huge engine of society (even nation) keeps running stably and smoothly. Challenge accepted?
