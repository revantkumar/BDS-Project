I strongly support OPT extension. United states is a nation of immigrants, and they had made tremendous contribution to the development of this country. Students with STEM degree are usually skilled at one or more specific fields, so they have the ability to apply their knowledge to solve the problems we are suffering. They can only make American life better than ever before. 

Beside, students with STEM degree are not stealing jobs from Americans. Most of the time, companies prefer American students than international students even sometimes the international student is more qualified. It happens very often that international students get the jobs that Americans will never do. 

As a conclusion, I strongly support OPT extension.
