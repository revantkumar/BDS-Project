I strongly support this amendment to allow STEM students with extra 24 months stay.

I am a foreign PhD student with a STEM degree. Based on what I have seeing, foreign students take the responsibility of a large portion of research and engineering work in the America in both academia and industry [1]. Most of the STEM PhD students are also paid by the US government to complete their research and training. Turing these people away is plainly a loss for both America and these students. 

Without the extension of current OPT policy, there is not enough time for the graduates to find the right job. Moreover, the current H1B visa lottery is broken. Even after getting the job, these graduates have a chance of not getting the H1B visa so that they need this OPT policy to keep their job.
