Expansion of OPT is not only good for us, international students, but also good for U.S. to keep competence in the world. Being open and equitable, giving hard-working people the opportunities are the core values for most people. We, as international students, are not asking for more than an opportunity to work in U.S. for a better life. I believe U.S. has this confidence being open because this is what makes U.S. stronger and stronger.
