I do support the proposal in many aspects.
1. This proposal can attract more talents from all over the world to come to America to make contribution to this society.
2. The actions to restrict those students to work here is unwise. Just look at the Europe area, because of there few work opportunities they cannot attract huge number of foreign students like we do and as a result their IT industry develops very slow.

Maybe in some degree supporting this proposal is supporting our economy
