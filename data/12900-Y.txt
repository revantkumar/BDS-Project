I strongly support this improved proposal for OPT extension on STEM degrees. There are thousands of international students who work for many scientific projects supported by NSF and other funds. Those projects have led to a great number of patents, technologies and innovations for both US-based academic and industries. For my personal experience, the flourish of US's high speed LTE network is a decent result of many international researchers who devoted 3-4 years in hard research works. Without 3-4 years of work, it is even impossible to understand the basic LTE specification, let alone making improvements. And US's leading position in medical industry is strongly contributed by PHD students in biology and chemistry field, the most of who are international-based students. However, it requires 3-4 years to make a sound and comprehensive progress on those fields, while seems impossible facing the original 1-year OPT regulation. The new extended OPT regulation gives them better chance to focus on those scientific projects without worrying about going home the next day. Without this new plan, the US academy and industry will both suffer from huge loss of those devoting international researchers, which will definitely hinder their own growth in the future.
