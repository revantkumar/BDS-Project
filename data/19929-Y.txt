When I graduated from a top university from China, I got offers to be admitted in PhD programs in UK, Canada, US and Singapore. I finally chose to study in US because I believe the job opportunity offered for STEM students would grant me valuable industry experience before I can go back to serve my home country. Without the STEM extension program, I would have opted for other countries with better job opportunities. I really think the STEM program is important to attract the most brilliant students from the whole world to be involved in academy research and technology development. In my graduate program, 80% students are from the top universities from all over the world. This was not because we were competing with US domestic students to be enrolled in the program. In fact, our department set special fellowship grant to assist US citizens only to study STEM majors, but every year there were not enough US citizenship students even willing to apply. Professors had to admit many internationally students to support and contribute to their research. Without the STEM option to attract international students, I can definitely see that most universities in this country will lose its attraction for the top brilliant students around the world. Lacking their support in the academic research would be a huge disaster for US.
