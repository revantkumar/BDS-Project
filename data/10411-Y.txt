I oppose these regulations. The law has never been changed, and foreign students are supposed to return to their home country within 60 days of finishing their coursework. As a parent of 2 college students and one graduate student, all in the STEM fields, I can attest to how difficult it is to find a job in these fields. Engineers are working as waiters and bartenders in order to eek out a bare bones lifestyle.These U.S. Citizens are graduating with mountains of college debt and no good jobs for them on the horizon. In addition, the foreign students are working for less, which drives down incomes of Americans. In a well publicized case, the Disney Company laid off American workers to reduce their payroll costs and made them train their foreign replacements! The percentage of American citizens in the workforce is at an all time low, while immigrants (legal and illegal) have had job gains over the last several years. This proposed change will make the situation far worse!
