I strongly support this new rule.

If this is turned down, it will be a very disruptive event for lots of companies and families.

In my opinion, an open attitude towards international talents and immigrants is what made this country great. Understand people have their own concerns about jobs, but by simply, forcefully, shutting talents out of the country will be a mis-step for the states.

I sincerely hope this new rule will be passed.

Thanks.
