Jean Hammerl Besides the obvious flagrant disservice of favoring foreigners over our own technical students & graduates trying to find jobs, there is the hidden danger of a subversive infiltrating the program to come here & commit havoc. Consider also the student loans and hard work by U.S. tech students to prepare for substantial careers in their chosen fields. Without those jobs, how will they pay their loans? More student loans will default, while others settle for lesser jobs, all doomed forever to low-paying jobs. This is just another Obama administration slap in the face of the American dream to get ahead, and another illegal ruse to get around our Constitution. Obama, the Anti-Job & Anti-Progress president!
