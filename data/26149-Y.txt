I highly support this regulation due to the following reasons:
1. The US industries still require a lot of well-trained high skilled workers while international students majoring in STEM are one of the major resources.
2. Extending OPT will not deprive the opportunity of other Americans looking for jobs because international students with a STEM degree will have to work in a job that fits in their STEM background. Jobs requiring a STEM background are only a small portion of the whole job market. The current situation will not improve without those STEM applicants and maybe, even worse. 
3. Again, OPT extension does not equal to immigration. Extending OPT has nothing to do with immigration. Since the prerequisite of having an OPT is to have a F1 student visa which is a non-immigration visa. This only offers those international students to legally work for a period of time.
