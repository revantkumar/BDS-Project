Sampanna Hegde There should be a rule to include master of business administration degree in the extended OPT. There are so many students who have an undergrad in STEM back in their home country ( a conventional 4 year degree in ENGINEERING, MATH, TECHNOLOGY and SCIENCE) . Since MBA does not qualify for the OPT extension ,a lot of bright students with STEM undergrad who are seeking to work as entry level managers in technology companies in US are loosing out in the H1B lottery system. Providing an extended OPT for people with STEM degrees from foreign Universities would help students add value to the US economy.
