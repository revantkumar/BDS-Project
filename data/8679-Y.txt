First, most companies pay international student as high as other employees. Some people who disagree with this proposal said that companies pay international student low salary. But this is not true. Employees who work in industry all know that international students are treated with same salary, and they even get more if they performance better than others.

Second, there are demands on position related to STEM majors. Certain majors, like computer science, not many Americans are study them. So it's necessary to have someone who learned those skill very well to fill out those positions. 

Third, United Stated is a immigration country. People are all moved from outside and the diversity is one of the key elements that made this country grow fast.
