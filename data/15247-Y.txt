Shiming Ren This updated new rule for OPT STEM will not only benefiting the students themselves but will also bring great economic benefits to US companies as well. First of all, with the previous shorter OPT + OPT STEM period, the company has to take the risk of loosing their employees in a very short of time (failing on being picked by H1B lottery). This risk will bring great loses to the OPT holder and the company. Moreover, with this risk, companies are less willing or dare to hire OPT students, who are great matches for a lot of hi-tech information technology positions. The lost of human resources and more efforts to hire people for proper positions will bring big burden to the companies. Thus, improving and expanding the OPT STEM rule will be a win-win situation for US companies and the students themselves.
