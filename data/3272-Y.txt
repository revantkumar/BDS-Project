I strongly support this and it is necessary to extend of OPT for F-1 students with STEM degree for the following reasons:

1. The U.S. is a multicultural society that welcome students all around the world and provide equal opportunities for people no matter where they come from.

2. If OPT is longer, more and more international students are willing to choose the U.S. for high education because students can have more chances to practice skills and gain experience after graduation.

3. International students can make contributions in the field of STEM if they have longer OPT period.
