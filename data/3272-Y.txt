Ella Sharp International students created or supported 340,000 jobs in a single financial year of 2013-2014, for every 7 international students enerolled, 3 US jobs are either created or supported. International students have become integral to the financial health of many US higher education institutions, but the impact goes beyond money spent on tuition fees and living expenses. Our country has reached on top of the world because of the technology and because of this rule actually the whole world is contributing towards the technological growth of our country. One of our richest sources of employment and economic growth will be jobs that require skills in these areas, collectively known as STEM. Hiring international students does not mean stealing jobs from Americans. I personally did not see ANY American students with STEM degrees and decent GPAs get unemployed.
