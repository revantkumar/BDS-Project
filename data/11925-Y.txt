As my personal view, I strongly support it.

First of all, when I chose to study my master degree in USA or UK, there is one thing very important that in USA, I have the opportunity to work and in relatively longer time.

And for the society, I think, there are a lot of foreigner students majoring in Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, etc. Nowadays many companies need to hire plenty of entry-level students, for these industries are emerging. If the extension of OPT stops now, there might a lack of people working on that, and will slow down the development of companies.
