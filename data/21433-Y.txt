I strongly support this rule and hope it could be approved without much efforts. 

Because international students are important income source for American universities. Now US collage has almost the most expensive tuition fee in the world, it is about 60+ thousand dollars per year for internationals, including accommodation and book fees. It is about twice as the expense of Japan or Austria. And internationals usually dont have loans, they pay full amount and cause no burden for banks! 

How could US universities stand out to attract international students? Only saying We have the best university is not enough. Because not every students could go to Harvard or MIT. So why they are willing to go to university like ASU rather than Hong Kong University, because America offers them opportunity for more hand-on practice with OPT and OPT extension. They can stay up to 36 months after graduating for doing internship or short-term work, they can explore more about this country and make better decision on their future career.

Without OPT extension, everywhere is same. Why they spend such a big amount of money all the way to US. If this really happened, we can expect a reduction in university funds and even a decrease in professors wage, or university would hire less staffs for saving money. That is to say, a institution aimed hiring only citizens will cut down its employment! Do you really think it is fair to US citizens?
