Xiang Huang Hi, I would strongly suggest that the OPT STEM program be approved by the U.S government.
The employers will be getting the top notch brains and new energy filled students who can bring benefit to the company by the new developments science and technology and IT ( Ex: BIG DATA in IT, Social Networking, Mobile technology) otherwise relying on obsolete technologies. These group of students take advanced and latest technology which is beneficial to the U.S technology industries, which bring a lot of value to the U.S GDP very year. And we know that technology is one of the factors that make U.S stronger than any other countries in the world.
These industries rely on the people who start from entry level and who graduate from STEM program. The technology giants these years has filed thousands of files for their international employees for their visa because these people are adding value.
Therefore, it is important that the new rule can be implemented very soon and let these people to make contribution.
