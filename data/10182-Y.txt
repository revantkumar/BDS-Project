This is my second comment.

Actually, Washtech Court ruling on STEM OPT has already had a great impact on these foreign students. 

There are a lot of cases on the forums: 

1. A guy from Taiwan who got his PHD degree from a top university in the USA and was not selected in H1b visa lottery of this year does despair due to this ruling. What he can do is going to quit his job when his OPT expires and go back home. 

2. Below is another sad story:

My parents brought me here to the United States when I was 14 and I have 
never been back to South Korea since then. 

By the time my family got their green cards after waiting 7 full years, I 
was already over 21 and independent, meaning not elligible for that green 
card. Being considered as an international student, I paid $135,000+ out of 
pocket for my college and graduate school tuitions. 

I was able to finish both Bachelor's and Master's in Biomedical Engineering 
in total of 4.5 years only because the $$$ figures never left my head. I 
found a decent job with a decent salary, developing decent medical 
instruments that are daily used to save lives in surgical operations. 

Then, one day, I am forced to leave the US. The Washtech court ruling is 
kicking me out to a country I have not stepped on for the past 10 years.

Signal Processing Products & Telecommunication components. My two co-workers 
from Italy were not selected in H1B Visa Lottery of this year. One's STEM OPT Extension 
has expired and has no other choice but to leave. The other's STEM OPT Extension 
is expiring very soon. They graduated from the best engineering schools in Italy 
and are very talented engineers.

Industries in US Tech Areas are bleeding.
