As a current unemployed American IT worker - rest assured there i no shortage of home grown IT workers. Unfortunately I stand not alone unemployment line - many of my colleagues are keeping me company. We have all faced the same fate of being fired or not hired to to the H1B and L1 visa program. To American It workers these visas are known as the American Worker Replacement Program. Like the current batch of Disney It workers making the national head lines for being forced to train their replacements - I have been down this path 3 times. Many of colleagues, now replaced by cheap foreign labor, can share the same unfortunate tale. 

The current national headline Disney workers will soon discover that the firing is only the beginning of American worker discrimination. Yes their job did not change but were told they did not have the skills. This will be reason for future job applications and if question which skill they did not have - it will be - you were not able to provide the average wing span of an African sparrow.
