"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities......" How about doing this for US citizens??? How many of our citizen college students could earn these degrees and fill all these needed positions? Stop enabling all these US companies in their efforts to hire foreign labor. Take those "incentives" that you're paying to these companies (those incentives come from MY tax dollars) and use them for scholarships for US citizens to get the education that is needed by these companies.
