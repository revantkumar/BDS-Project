I am in favor of improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 students with stem degrees and all other eligible F-1 students.
Reasons:
1. Working in STEM fields can improve the diversity of that field and improving the development of that fields.
2. With the fast development of STEM fields, there would be more job opportunities for people who is eligible and hardworking.
3, Considered the global trend, stop OPT extension is against the trend and is bad for U.S. economy.
