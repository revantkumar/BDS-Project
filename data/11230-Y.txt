I support the extension of F1 OPT STEM visas to 24 months to support immigrant students in their development and possible contribution to the U.S. economy through future work permits. We don't want to lose the best and brightest foreign talent, who are graduating from our university system, if they can help fuel our economic growth and innovation.
