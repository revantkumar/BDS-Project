I support this document because international students making contributions to the U.S. economy, and their deserve better and longer opportunities to practice what they learned from the school. After implementing the encouraging petition, more international students will have a better motivation come to our country. They are strong financial support not only for universities, but also for tourismretailing and many other industries. So again, I support the petition because both U.S and international students will taste the benefits.
