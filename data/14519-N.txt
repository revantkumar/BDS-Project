This is so, wrong,for the American workers.We encourage our ,children and grandchildren, to ,attend college only, to, be left, with, massive debt ,while, our ,leaders, continue, to, pander to, corporate, interests.
For, years we, have outsourced, good paying ,jobs to, foreign, countries ,ll, for, corporate, greed.
, ,Now our, leaders, want, to, throw ,our ,workers, and ,those ,attending ,collage under the bus, all, in, the name of, providing ,an, unlimited ,supply, of ,cheap ,labor.It, never has been about, not ,finding, qualified, workers but finding cheap labor.
