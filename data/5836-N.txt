I really don't think we need anymore immigrants coming into our country. They are taking jobs away from our people. I just don't understand how this President can continue to do as he pleases. In this case we don't need Senators or Representatives. He just takes the bull by the horn and does it all. The Immigrants that come into our country receive all the benefits that we do, and have not worked at all. They receive Social Security, food stamps and what ever they want. I think enough is enough.
