The companies that hire these workers in some cases abuse them. The workers can do nothing about it for fear of losing their jobs and being forced to leave the country.

I met such a worker and he related being forced through this threat to work long hours and on weekends sometimes 6-7 days a week. He was hoping to find relief through another employer.

These fiat executive policies, that violate the Constitution and foster immigration that the American people do not want, that take jobs from Americans, and that make the VISA workers the virtual slaves of their employers, workers who fear for their livelihood and their families, these are reprehensible policies. These executive acts should not be happening. They are denying the people their right of representation. They are the acts of a tyrant.

Since they are happening, the employers should be subject to penalties, where whistle-blowing VISA workers can get free from abusive employers. Those employers should be fined heavily and all the fines should go to reduce the debt.

Again, the solution is to limit and eliminate such visas until the the percentage of the American citizen working at each age level reaches historical levels and unemployment reaches less than 5% working age Americans including the ages of 16-72 since people are living longer and having to retire later.
