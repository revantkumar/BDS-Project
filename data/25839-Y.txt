Hello DHS...If you read all the comments carefully here..you will only get the answer on how the foreign nationals wants to use this rule...They want to use this as a way to become immigrant of this country by filing H1B and then GREEN CARD and then CITIZENSHIP....Already there are many Foreign nationals in this country who can be helpful to the nation in future generations as their children will be born and bought up here who will also serve this country in future years..Don't think that this rule help for America's future but in turn it will give a strong negative impact like there can be lot of revolutions happen if these foreign nationals snatch away bread n butter of people of this country.....STOP THIS RULE
