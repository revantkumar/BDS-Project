Born in European, now working as an engineering role in a manufacturing industry. I failed in last H1B poll. Now I really hope we could MAKE THIS RULE PASSED, not only for a foreigner like me, but for MILLIONS OF US CITIZENS as well! 

Reason: those STEM students/employees are usually working in roles that many U.S. citizens don't really want to, two of my French friends love mathemetics, and they are really good at it, but many of my U.S. friends prefer other courses to math. U.S. need people who loves math, and those will convert their knowledge to efficiency and innovations that creates more work opportunities for those U.S./non-U.S. citizens. In another word, if those people leave U.S., it will be a loss to the employer and they may not want to find another U.S. employee that is strong in engineer but weak in math.
