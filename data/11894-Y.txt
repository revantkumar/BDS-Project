I totally agree on expanding OPT for STEM degrees students. The reasons are as following:
1. Companies in US are in high demand for STEM degrees graduates, which can not be satisfied by domestic US students. Those foreign students actually make big contribution for US economy.
2. Foreign students pay higher tuition than domestic students which brings benefits to US education also.
3. OPT only allows STEM degrees students to find major related jobs, which will not occupy other people's working opportunities.
