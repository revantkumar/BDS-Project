I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I am an international student from china pursing the master degree in computer science. 
For this extension rule, there are some evidences to support this.
Firstly, DHS believes that students participating in practical training in STEM fields should be encouraged to pursue meaningful projects that contribute to a deeper understanding of their field of study and help develop the practical skills necessary to advance their careers. If an international student lost his legal identity when the process of the project has been finished only half, the leaving of the student would be a disaster for the student as well as the project if he plays an important role in it.

Secondly, DHS anticipates that the 24-months extension would significantly benefits the U.S. employers since the they might need to rely on some skills acquired by STEM OPT students, as well as their knowledge of markets in their own countries. For instance, Uber wants to get into the Chinese market. Within the help of Chinese students in U.S. it has a great chance to study and analyze how the Chinese market running.

In my point of view, the new OPT extension rule should be supported. Hope more people support this.
