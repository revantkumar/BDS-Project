After reading through the proposal. There are a couple of points that I would like to comment. First, the introduction of the policy will, for sure, boost America's IT industry, which is proven already by the booming economy of Silicon Valley. Second, more time for OPT means a better preparation for students to land H1-B visa, which in turn would ensure enough labor supplies for IT industry. Third, U.S. is a nation of immigration. With that being said, we should not distinguish new comers from current citizens. Any act of closing the door to new immigrants is a violation of the very fundamental role of the America: attract talents from all over the world and build the greatest nation. I guess no one would want the America to become the second Venice, which shutdown its door to inclusive economy and now becomes the museum of the world instead of dominating the world economy.
