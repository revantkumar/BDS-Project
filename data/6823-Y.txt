The US engineering and science departments have a lot of international students, most scientific research papers were published by international students, they are doing well to make US better because there is always hope here, so the stem extension is good for both students and US economy. President Obama said at UB that everyone should get rewarded if they work hard, study hard, regardless where there they come from, that is why top international students come to US rather than North Korea, because there is hope and ladder for them. The government should not cancel it for more jobs, that will kick the knowledge to China and India, they will lose the advantage. With more higher educated guys here, they can create much more things than just few jobs. US is always full of hope and justice, everyone should get a chance to show themselves, that makes the US more diverse and competitive.
