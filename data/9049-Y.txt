I would support the OPT extension for the following reasons: 

1. If the OPT could be extended, it will attract a lot more international students coming to earn higher education degree, which would enormously boost US economy. You know every single one of the has to pay out of state tuition if they attend public colleges. Keep in mind, not only the tuition and fees which are a large amount of money, but also the living expenses they potentially spend is an important factor the the local economy. 

2. The OPT is a good way to attract elites from all over the world. US has to keep absorbing outstanding individuals just as the past a couple of years to hold it's only-superpower position in the world. All those intelligent people have huge contribution on development on all aspects, such as IT, engineering, science etc. and you know, those high-tech are the key components of our economy growth, with that being said, it is very important to provide good environment and future for those elites to keep the dragging force of US economy. 

3. From the employer's point of view, we love those international graduates, who are competitive and hard working. They could largely help the development of our cooperations. In the past, it was a pain to loss some excellent candidates just because of their immigration status, which is a big loss. 

4. Longer exposure time to American working style would benefit our companies because after they return back to their country, they would become the driving force of their country and would have better chance to have privilege of operating bigger companies. And they are the ones who would tend to do business with American companies when it comes to international trade. This is very important driving force to our economy as well as our culture expansion.
