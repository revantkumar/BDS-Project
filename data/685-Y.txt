Shu Cheng I strongly support the OPT extension rules. I benefit from the current 17month extension rule. My major is Information System. When I started the application for my master degree, I faced the choices of US, UK, Singapore, Australia etc.. Two important reasons for me to choose US are 1) United States has the top level computer scientist and technology. 2) I would be able to use the opt program to gain some industry experience. I think for both reasons, the OPT extension rule should be executed. One reason for US to have so many top scientists is that people from all over the world can come here to study and conduct research. Never US is a single-culture country. Education is a good way to select smart people. If the students can find a job/project here, their capability/value have been demonstrated. It is very unreasonable that they need to stop when the project just starts. It makes US degree less attractive and the government cannot gain the benefit for providing good education and even scholarship.
