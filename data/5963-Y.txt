Lawrence Bressler The Optional Practical Training (OPT) program is a slap in the face to American students who graduate from STEM programs. I am in the STEM field myself, and I know many workers who have been out of work for a year or more because of H1-B visas and outsourcing. This is another nail in the coffin.

I'm sure the White House hears from lobbyists whose main objective is to pay workers lower wages. They do not care about American workers, only short term profits. But it's time the White House hears from regular people in the high tech industry who understand what it's really like out there in the real job market. Sorry if we are not paying off our Senators and Congressmen in terms of campaign contributions. The OPT program will help to shrink the already diminishing middle class.
