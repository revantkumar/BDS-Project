Christian Sanderson Diversity is what makes this country the best country in the world. If this rule is not issued then I think we are going to loose our identity. This will ensure continuous supply of young talented STEM graduates and promote growth of science and technology. STEM graduates should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. Providing more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field.
