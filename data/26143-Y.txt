All the people in U.S now are come from the other countries, maybe several decades ago or 200 years ago. Additionally U.S is a country of immigrants. Many people from anti-immigrant groups think OPT exension may cause they lose their job and the people who have OPT extension will immigate to this country. However, the opconcept they have is based on their benefit, not from the country. The development in a country needs the people who receive high education and have high technique, not the people who have localism. What the people who have localism can do is to destory this country.
The OPT extension is a method that could attract the students who receive high education in U.S to service this country. If the extension is not allowed, it absolutely will cause these high-tech students to leave this country and U.S will lose its attract. Maybe in one day U.S will do not have any competitiveness compared to other countries.
