I am writing to support the proposal from the DHS. Foreign students in higher education constitute a great pool of talents for the United States. Providing them with the best educational experiences with practical training is a great way to make what they learn useful for society. By attracting these highly-educated young people and providing them with opportunities, we will strengthen the leadership of the United States in science and technology.
