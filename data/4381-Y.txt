Anonymous Anonymous I strongly support 24 months STEM OPT extension. It will a great opportunity for us to build a career path with the technological innovations that are available in USA. First of all, the education which available in USA is one of the best educations in world. Unlike UK or other countries, USA is providing an practical opportunity to enhance our knowledge which we have pursed by STEM OPT.By working in best companies in world like microsoft,google,facebook, we can able to enhance our practical skills.

I am very much disagree with other comments who are saying that we are stealing their jobs. Why would a company will spend more money for our H1B filling when they have enough resource here. Why would company need to go through the painful fillings if there are enough resources in USA. Because there are no enough STEM graduates in USA. Because of OPT, our international student are getting chance to part of those positions. But others are claiming it as we are stealing the jobs. 

Once again thank for the opportunity, I really appreciate of DHS to provide this opportunity to talk about our views on OPT extension.
