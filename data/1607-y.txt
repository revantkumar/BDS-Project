Emily Zhou I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

First, as more and more international students come to the U.S, they receive advanced skills and knowledge from universities. However, due to the strict immigration policies, they cannot contribute themselves to the industry in U.S. It is big loss for U.S.

Second, although the United States is one of the most powerful countries in the world, the competition among countries become more and more fierce. It is important for the government to attract the talent people to work for the United States.
