I have been an interviewer for a few years in a big tech company, from what I know, the company prefers to hire US natives than international students, they provide much more headcount for US natives than international people.
But still some US natives complains about they can not find a job, i think the only reason is that those people do not qualify for the job and can not compete with internationals. 

How internationals people succeed in the job seeking market? they must learn more, work much harder and to get it. There must be a reason they are finally hired. We need to keep those international people. NOT let them go back.

This rule is really good, we definitely need to CONTINUE this rule. 
For those people who can not find a job: Companies already gave you more chances, it is because you are not qualify. Please SHUT UP
