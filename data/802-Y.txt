Hua Liao Please, this program must pass. As an international entrepreneur starting a business in America, I believe that my business has the potential to grow to a significant size and create both work opportunities for American citizens and value for American society. The extension of OPT will grant my business a longer time to survive the early stage uncertainty. I need this extra two years to build it into a lasting business and continue generating value for this country.
