Jessie Shang I strongly support the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to improve and expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would be a big benefit for U.S. tech companies to hire more knowledgeable graduate college students for improving its marketing competence. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students, but also could possibly accelerate more opportunities for new jobs for U.S. citizens.
