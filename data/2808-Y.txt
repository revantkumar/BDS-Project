Zach Yao I strongly agree with this proposal.
1. International students are paying full tuition in the university. STEM OPT extension can attract more international students come to U.S. to purse a degree which means the university in U.S. can have more money to do research.
2. STEM program concludes most of engineering and science degrees. This STEM OPT extension proposal doesn't have impact on other industry like Disney Land.
