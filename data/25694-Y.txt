I am a student at Computer Science department, now am working at an IT company. I learn a lot in industry, lots of things I can not meet in school. And I also contributed a lot for my company. I finished several releases to help thousands of people, change their lives. I am happy to do that. 

I spent a long time at this company in learning. After that, I did lots of work, and company looks me as an important staff. I believe that if I can extend my OPT session time, it would help both of me and my company. I can learn more, company could save its cost to train a new staff, and we can help more people to improve their lives.

Thanks!
