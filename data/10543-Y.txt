I support the extension because talented people is a resources, and USA need this kind of resources.
1: Talented people can make a great contributions to the wealth of the country, and hence promote the economy and welfare of USA.
2: Tanlented people can promote the technology advancement in USA, make America a more powerful country and more competitive country in the world.USA need talented people to compete with China and other new development economics bodies.
3: Many Tanlented people may start their own business, and promote employment.
4: Extension of OPT can attract talented people come to USA.
5: Talented foreigners will not take good jobs away from US citizens, on the contrary, they will promote the economy and hence make more employment opportunities for US citizens.
6: Less people does not mean more employments, look at Detroit, they have less and less population,but less and less employment rate.
