Liangzhen Du I strongly support the new 36-month OPT rules.

I am a new graduate in statistics major. After graduation, I got an job as an Risk Analyst. And in our team, there's not many native American because most of the American don't like to get a degree with Mathematical major. 

But the financial industry needs these analyst. Without a health and safety financial industry, U.S might lost billions of billions of dollars. To make a better industry environment, please extend the OPT period.
