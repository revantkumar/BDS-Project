It's short-sighted to reject STEM students in a long term. Let's talk about this problem from the perspective of what could international student to the U.S. economy.

According to this news report (http://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/2014/11/17/number-of-international-college-students-continues-to-climb) "The U.S. enrolled a record-breaking number of international students during the 2013-2014 school year, welcoming 886,052 undergraduate and graduate students to colleges and universities throughout the country, according to a report released today." 

U.S. is `notorious` for its high tuition fee even for U.S. citizens. So why do so many international students choose U.S. instead of Germany, France, U.K, Hongkong or Singapore? I have a Ph.D friend from UCLA who also received offer from Oxford, but decided to come here. Why? Because U.S. is more friendly to international student in terms of OPT! She could have more time to plan on her career after graduation. I received full funding from a top University in Hongkong, but I still chose to came here for M.S. degree with family funding. Why? The same reason. My family needs to pay $70,000 per year!

If there is no more extension of OPT, then there will be no more attraction for international student and less funding for researchers in public schools. In some sense, high education has become an industry in the U.S., and it will definitely be `stroke` heavily with the cancellation of OPT.

Remember that international students not only pay their tuition to the U.S., they also need to pay for their residency, transportation, food, etc.!
