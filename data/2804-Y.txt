I am a F-1 student working full-time under OPT STEM extension now. I applied for H1B visa this year but I did not win the lottery. I have one more chance in the lottery next year. Therefore, I strongly support the proposal and I even hope that the OPT STEM extension could be 36 months. I enjoy working for my current employer and they like me as well. It would be a great loss for both of us if I had to leave the US due to visa problems. I am very glad to see that the proposal applies to students already in OPT STEM extension as well.
