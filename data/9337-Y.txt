I support not only brightest students who are studying in this country but also any immigrant who wants to study in any USA university. Taxes and Fees are exaggerated and almost every university in this country has as priority money instead of looking excellence in education programs. Universities teachers continue with the traditional teaching where students have a passive rule while teachers teach and talk with a lot of mistakes. I am from Argentina and finished my Major at Weber State University on 2010, in Ogden, Utah, and I cannot get my graduation certificate yet, because I cannot pay my last class.
