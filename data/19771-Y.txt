I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. After receiving education from many famous universities inside U.S., those international STEM students with high tech knowledge can really contribute to U.S. Especially currently high tech companies have a really crucial role in the economy, the extension for OPT can greatly helps those company find right people with reasonable cost, therefore boost their development and contribute to the U.S. economy.
2. American is a country based on immigration. It is a great country because immigration is able to give energies and new ideas to the country. There have been great scientist, great actors and great economist who are originally immigrate. The nation's spirit and it's strength is based on this. Extension of OPT can help international students with talent to stay in the country and greatly help making U.S. a great country.
3. Extension on OPT will not influence on U.S. job market. Most of the international STEM students are focused on finding a job in industry especially need higher level education. Therefore it will not influence the job market a lot since most of the job opportunities are for people with general educations. This on the other hand, would help create more job opportunities. This is because with the increase in higher level positions and values, more general work will be created and therefore, more job will be created.
