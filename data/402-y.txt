Vivien Zhang I STRONGLY SUPPORT this proposal for the following reasons:
1. US needs foreign students especially in fields of Science & Technology. These students can contribute to the increase of US economy. Competition does exist, but I believe the advantages this proposal takes would be much more than the competition risk that comes along with it. 

2. Keeping international students in US job market after their graduation will benefit US in seeking potential cooperation and friendship with those students' home country. After their working and staying in US, when they come back to home country, they will take US values and culture back, which would be awesome.

3. Diversity keeps US a free and comprehensive country. Many successful Scientists were international students before their success. This proposal will make it possible to bring in excellent talents for US.
