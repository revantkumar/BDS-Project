I'm just curious about how you define "TREATED BETTER" here. We go through limited admission rate, limited chance of financial aid, and pay more than double the citizens' tuition fees. We only have 90 days of unemployment after graduation, get paid less for the same job and are not even eligible for those "Citizens only" jobs. The truth is we have to work harder than citizens to get education and further a job, and the reason we "accept" lower wage is because there's no law to protect our rights as you citizens. We are not intruders, and we do make contributions to the country. We just want to get better education and some work experience in the US, the most inclusive country of the world.
