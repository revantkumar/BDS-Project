This selling out of AMERICANS, has to stop. We, the AMERICAN CITIZENS, are fed up with the greedy behavior of our representatives, and the greedy owners of companies nationwide. Our Children deserve to find and get jobs, they deserve to be productive individuals in their OWM COUNTRY! The BLANTANT disregard for AMERICAN CITIZENS is out of control. Those individuals in Congress and Senate, have forgotten who THEY TRULY WORK FOR, WHO PAYS THEIR PAY CHECKS, AND WHO VOTED THEM INTO OFFICE. Well, 2016, is around the corner, and WE TGE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO CLEAN HOUSE! START DPING YPUR JOBS, START PROTECTING THE AMERICAN CITIZENS, or face the unemployment lines! WE, THE PEOPLE ARE COMING!
