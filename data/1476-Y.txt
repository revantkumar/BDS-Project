I strongly support this proposed rule. There are mainly three reasons. First, the graduated students with STEM degrees, especially those PhD degree holders, can make a lot of contribution to the economy and technology development of United States. These high educated group of people are the real talents that any countries hope to have and to employ. If US government does not allow their OPT extension, the US will lose too much. Especially, the US government has paid large amount of tuition (at least $20,ooo per year) for most of the PhD students by the research funding. If they can not continue to work in US, the government will totally lose these money. If these students go to the other countries, the US will lose more. Secondly, most of the projects in companies or in government can not be completed in only one year. If the employee with STEM degree has great performance on this project, but he/she has to stopped it, the company or the government has to recruit some other persons to replace the role of this great employee. Usually, it is hard to find someone who master the high-tech skills in a short time. Even if someone is found, the company will spend lots of money and time to re-train a new employee. I believe no company want to do like this. In order to keep the benefits of the company, especially those small high-tech start up companies, the US government should allow STEM degrees holder work for a longer time in US. Last but not the least, this rule will encourage more and more talents to come to US to contribute more to the society, otherwise, the US will lose its competitiveness to attract the talents.
