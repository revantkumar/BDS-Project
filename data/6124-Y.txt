The proposed OPT STEM extension rule is a great relief to the students and also to the economy of US. The contribution of the students on OPT is very crucial in many of the IT, Medical and pharma industries.
Also, due to the vast applications for H1 during last couple of years, the students on OPT is losing the opportunities in building their career and also losing their contribution to serve the world's pride, The USA.
The very good part of this revised rule is streamlining the whole process to report the status of an OPT student through mentoring program through DSO or the employer.
I hope the regulatory body understands the logistics of the proposed rule and comments then come up with a diligent rule in action.
Thanks and hoping for the best
