I am a international student from China and I support OPT extension. The old 17-month extension of OPT made me go to United States instead of German to pursue my master degree in electrical engineering. With OPT extension, it means that as an international, I can get more working experience out of school than my fellow Chinese who went to German for lower tuition. And that working experience will make me more competitive over other my fellow Chinese who came back from German when I need to seek a job after I go back to China. 
It is the OPT extension policy that makes US attracts more International students in STEM over other countries even though the cost of study in US is the most expensive in the world. ( I spent 100,000 dollars during my 2 year master degree in US while my friend spend 30,000 during his study in German.)
If the OPT extension get cancelled, the US will no longer be a attractive destination for foreign STEM students.
