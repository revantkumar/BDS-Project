Dear Nelson,

US citizens have always been given priority in the job market and in school by the government.
In college, American students are eligible for financial aid, off-campus employment, full-time employment while in school, work-study, etc. None of these is available to international students.
In the job market, international students require expensive visa sponsorship which will cost a lot to the employer, making employers prefer American students with same qualifications. 
With the OPT, we are able to allow the best and greatest people from abroad to join us, making this great country even greater, so STEM OPT is a good thing. Cheers!

Warmest regards
