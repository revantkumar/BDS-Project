I don't really understand why some department was trying to deduct the period of OPT. The exaplanation they made is " to protect more job resources for US citizens". OK, sounds reasonable, totally understand. But the funny thing is they are using their narrow nationalism and enthusiastic patriotism to destroy the country. Look at the fact, a lot of my friends 
who are talented in all academic fields, engineering, computer science, science, they are devoting themselves in building not only their own life, but also the country! U.S., as a country with short history, can develop in surprisingly fast speed during these 240 years, the main reason is the U.S. Spirit- involving and absorbing all persons with the ability to build the country. It's kind of hurting knowing that we are not welcomed by some people here:(
