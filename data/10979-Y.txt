I strongly support this rule.
Equality is the most important character American people held regard to all humans. So it is not reasonable to protect the job against foreign students. 
Longer OPT attracts more talented students from all over the world who are important power to US economy and technology development. 
Foreign students do not take jobs from US people, but create more job opportunities for the society.
As an traditional immigrant country, US was developed and supported by generations of "foreigners". US culture is based on diversity, which is also the origin of your power.
