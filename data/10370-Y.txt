marie ma In fact, the OPT extension is even more significant in this sense. Many many research and development projects will take a few years to complete. The extension policy allows students/workers to contribute without interruption. I learned that their are around 34000 students are on extension now and a huge number of others are waiting to apply. If the extension is revoked, just imagine the number of projects will be affected and the loss to those companies. On the large level, it will have a negative to overall US economy for sure.
