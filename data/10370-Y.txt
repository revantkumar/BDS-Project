I give out strong support for this policy because it would make the country more attractive to foreign students. While at the same time with potential possibility to increase huge mount of income in education service. Some body hold opinion that this policy would leave opportunities which belonging to local citizenship away. While I think it is the lack of competency, not other competitor who took work opportunity by themselves. Limit the chance for foreigner will make local people more lazy due to lack of competition, which is also harmful to the market. This policy would be a stimulation for local citizenship to work hard in order to be more competitive towards foreign student.
