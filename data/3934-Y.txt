I strongly support the extension of OPT for F-1 students in US. In the past decade we witnessed how many foreign talented students have contributed their skills and energy into the STEM industry. Foreign students has been an inevitable power in the technology development of US. 
So Give those F-1 students an opportunity to pay back the society with talents and also give those tech companies opportunities to accept them and transform those valuable talents into future prosperity.
