I do support this plan. This plan helps high tech companies in finding talented candidates, which is helpful to US economy. We already enjoyed a lot of benefits (lower unemployment rate, economy growth) from OPT plan these years. Extending the STEM OPT to 24 months is absolutely necessary since some science programs takes longer time to complete. US needs to attract more talented people
