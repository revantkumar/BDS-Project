I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. This program creates an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans and it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. As a recent college graduate, I am struggling to find work and this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens. I see foreigners working jobs that I can do. I also have two high school boys in engineering and tech. Companies will hire the cheaper foreign workers over them. Why would you want foreigners taking jobs from citizens of the United States?
