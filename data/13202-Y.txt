OPT Extension program is necessary for United States to maintain its economic prosperity and leading place in technology advancement:
According to a recent study released by Pew Research Center, more than half of advanced degrees in STEM field were earned by international student, which coincide with past experience. If these part of human resource were excluded from labor markets, it would be inevitable for United States to lose many multi-national technology companies due to lack of talents (US has lost a lot for high tax, dont lose more for shortage of labors). 
And please dont forget an obvious deduction, more STEM talents lead to more innovation and more innovation create more jobs
