I strongly SUPPORT this proposal by taking the several factors into account as follows:

First, the government should let the highly educated foreign students such as PhDs to keep stay and work in U.S., and let them make contributions to U.S. companies and tax income. 

Second, the U.S. economy is still waiting for new power and new generations. These hard-working, brilliant young students should deserve equal opportunities for making contributions to U.S. companies and economy.

Third, personally, I don't agree with those opinions saying that the competition is not good for the U.S. native citizens. Competition is everywhere and is always good, since it can stimulate the employees strengthen their skills and knowledges, and improve the whole level of the entire working system. 

In sum, I strongly SUPPORT this proposal.
