Who did you allow to take my highly skilled job, why?
As one born in the USA am I not entitled to support myself and my family without the government permitting an "alien" to come here for the sole purpose of taking my job.
94 + millions of Americans are unemployed or underemployed because of existing policies and the government wants to bring in massively more people to compete for my job or my benefits. Insane!
