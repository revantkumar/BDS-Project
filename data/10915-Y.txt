I think expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees are the most correct thing to do. These students who received education in America and can benefit America's economic. Most of these student, their majors are like Statistics or Applied Math, which not many American people want to learn. However, the job market still need tons of people who has more advanced math knowledge, for example, data analyst. The second point I want to make is that 12 month OPT is really too short. For instance, one student got a job offer from a company. However, he didn't get his H-1b visa because of the low rate (only 1 out 4 can get the visa last year). If there is no OPT extension, this company will lost the person they spend a lot of time and effort to hire, not because of this person not behaving good at work (most of the time, the person will be a hard worker), just because of the unfair OPT policy. It will influence a lot of American companies and make them wasting time and money. Finally, I don't think expanding OPT for F-1 student will hurt their American people's employment rate. On the opposite, these students will help the economic growth of American society.
