It's hard to put into words the anger I feel concerning this ruling. OPT is a barely disguised work program for foreign students and graduates. There's no way this could pass the true legal test so it can only be instigated in the shadows. This regulation needs to be scrapped and foreign graduates returned to their country as was the original intention.
