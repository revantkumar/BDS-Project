Students work in the United States not only benefit themselves, but also benefit the United States society as a whole. They apply what they learned in college or school, bringing new ideas, perspectives and efforts to the society. They are a growing power that pushes the market and society to move forward. They may shed a new light to some problems which already existed in America.The country itself is developed based on immigrants, and it does not make sense to reject new immigrants because it means to reject progress and further development. People rejecting and holding doubts to would-be new immigrants may reject themselves.
