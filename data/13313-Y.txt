I support this rule and have some comments after reviewing all the negative comments over this OPT extension.
It's true that a country should provide more opportunities for citizens who work hard to earn a job. U.S is was firstly formed by harworking immigrants, which are now called citizens. It's built strong because its citizens were honest, diligent people. This should remain the same if America wants to keep its strength as a global superpower. This rule acts like a filter-- filter out those who doesn't have what it takes to build a stronger nation and keep those who are willing to contribute their power to empowering the country's economy. I'm not saying that the students who got this OPT extension would stay and become a citizen, but it's for the country's benefit to keep those students.

Also, I wonder if this job would really take away the opportunity of hardworking American people. The current limitations on F-1 visa, in the first place, guarantees that the students wouldn't have an equal opportunity in competing with local graduate. This means who got the extension would have be EXCELLENT in what they do. Most privileged local graduate don't really know how different 'hardworking' means to an international students. They may be hardworking, but, most of the time, when competing with international students, they would still lack professional and academic disciplines. So this rule is only impairing the opportunity of those who doesn't quite satisfy the standards, international students or local workers. I do not see why this is giving disincentives to employ local workers, if those workers are really worthy of the scarce opportunity. It is actually a good incentive for people to work harder and build their skill to contribute to American economy.

I strongly stand behind this proposal to pass the rule of extending OPT period.
