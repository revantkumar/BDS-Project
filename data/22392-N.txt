The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned home. But now it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.
OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year. 
There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers. 
A Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand: OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. 
If the U.S. indeed "needs" the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training? And, if workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans? 
This is not right, its a bad deal for everyone except the stock holders of the companies utilizing the program, but perhaps they are the only ones you care about
