I totally agree with this proposal. First of all, the competitiveness of US in the world would be reduced seriously without the contribution of excellent international students. Because a lot of them with STEM degree are working at some positions that most Americans don't like. Second, this proposal would contribute a lot to attract more and more talented people all over the world to come to US instead of other countries and contribute to it. Finally, F-1 non-immigrants students will become more confident with more working experience in US when they go back to their own country.
