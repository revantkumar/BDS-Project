I think this rule of 24 months of opt extension is really important for the F1 Students.This rule will help USA to preserve its talent and not let it get away . Considering the number of F1- Students which are coming every year and are also employed in so many companies, we should take step forward to see to it that these companies don't loose business. This new rule will help in the prosperity of the country and maintain standards in technology,finance and all differnt line of businesses.
