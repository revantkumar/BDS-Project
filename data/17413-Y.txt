The data is interesting, but without providing any resources of where the data is cited from, the argument is very implausible.
I can understand life is hard, but the complain is really irrelevant to the proposed rule. The proposed rule is putting US workers in the top priority. It has LOTS of regulations on the fields that the STEM students works at, and they DO NOT coincide with the fields where US workers are seeking employment in. Reading through the terms in the document is highly recommended to make comments on it.
