I agree that the proposed rule should be passed. Lets see. If the 17 months extension is canceled, a lot of stem students have to leave US and contribute their energies to other countries every year. You know in this world, other governments are so eager to have these stem students going back. U.S. trained so many international high technical students and most of them have to leave the country only because they cannot have a legal status in just 1 year. In this situation, we can see that maybe in less than 10 years, other counties will build their own high technical team using people that U.S. trained and gave up easily. How Leifeng spirit it is!
