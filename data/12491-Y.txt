I think this proposal is beneficial to all American citizens for the following reasons.
1. Most international students have advanced degrees. They are not cheap workers, as most of them work in high-tech companies. They contribute to our society by pushing forward technology development, and they pay 30% of their salary as tax to the state of federal government which serves education, medical and other welfare of US citizens.
2. The competition they bring to US actually brings efficiency and benefits us all. We should not be afraid of it. Many international students run their own start-ups, which actually creates more jobs for us.
There are many people who oppose to this proposal claim that US citizenship becomes nothing with the extension of OPT. To those people, I must emphasize that we should not forget what makes this country keep getting stronger and vital. Refusing to offer these talents an opportunity to work and create more value for this country is absolutely short-sighted.
