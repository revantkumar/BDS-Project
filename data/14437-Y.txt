This extension provides a fair opportunity for foreign students to compete on a level footing with the native population. If there is skilled non-immigrant work force available they will be able to secure employment irrespective of STEM extension being granted or not. All the firms in the U.S.employ a big number of foreign workers, not because they are willing to work for less money, but because of the quality of work. Equal opportunity should mean equal opportunity in all ways, means and forms. Just because a person's origin is not in the U.S. Should not deny him/her equal opportunity. 

I strongly support this proposal.
