Yoshio Honma I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. OPT is an essential part of the college education. For STEM programs, the sufficient time of training in the industry is necessary. The previous 29 months of OPT was the main reason that I chose to study in U.S. What's more, the young workers who worked on OPT extension period have contributed huge value to the nation. The demand for technical workers and engineers are still strong in the industry. Extending OPT is the perfect way to combine the goal of higher education and economic growth.
