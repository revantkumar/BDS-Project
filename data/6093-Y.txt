I strongly support this policy because I am a foreign student in US and need this police to come true my dream. I think it will be decent to give others a chance to succeed if others success won't lead to your failure, which happens in most of cases and this policy is not an exception.

I also understand why some people do not like rules, but I have to say that those short-term worries are unnecessary and that this policy will lead long-term in prosperity in US, which will be beneficial for everyone in this country.

Some people said this rule will lead to US companies to hire foreign students and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, but the thing is companies care more about benefit than tax. Thus, they just want to hire employees who could get the job done. One of the most important reasons why a lot of companies have their departments in US is that they could hire more talent employees here. With this policy, more talent people will come to US, which in turn increase job opportunities in US.

Some people said that this rule violates some other laws in US (I am not sure if this kind of rules exist though). Following rules is important, but the more important thing is to let rule service us instant of being restricted by rules. World is chancing, laws need to keep the edge of age, and it is why we not only need police but we also need legislation. When we find a policy to help US become better, be brave to try it.
