Andrew Bradstreet I agree with this proposed rule. The international students contribute a lot to US development. Many international students are smart and hardworking, and do very great jobs, especially in STEM industry. They also support the economy, because they spend much money on studying in US. We should give the foreign students opportunities to work here. It's absolutely a win-win deal.
