Please don't forget that many US schools are now largely funded by international students' out-of-state tuition and fees ($50K+ a year). For example, more than 20% of our local state university's student body is international. The direct and indirect (living expenses, shopping, tourism, etc.) contributions to the US economy are gigantic every year (billions of $), and the numbers are still rising. These students don't live on US social security unlike many many more illegal immigrants in the US, for which most of you should put lots of negative comments on right now but not on this OPT topic. 

Should the OPT extension be removed, many international students for sure are going to shunt away from American schools but go to other country's, lacking the confidence that there will be enough training opportunities to supplement their education.

Therefore, I give my strongest recommendation and support for the OPT extension, from this perspective.
