Menghan Qin I really agree with this proposal. 
American economic highly depends those advanced technology and science companies which obviously hire numerous foreign cheap labors. These labors are doing the stressful work and few natives would like to work like that. What they work indeed increased American GDP a lot. Only new graduated students would do these work. If there is no OPT Extension, these students can only work for one year, how can these companies hire more people for those stressful work? If that is the case, American will be even worse.
