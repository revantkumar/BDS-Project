Elaine Morgan YES! I DO SUPPORT the opt-extension. 

I am a student majoring in statistics, one reason I chose US
instead of Canada for education is because of the OPT
STEM, which allows me to work for more than 1 year,
gaining more practical work experience. So I strongly
support this new OPT rule.. visit 1point3acres.com for more.
Without this OPT STEM, I do not think that US could
attract so many foreign STEM students to contribute to
various industries every year.

At the same time, US employers have benefited a lot from
the increased ability to rely on the skills acquired by STEM
OPT students while studying the United States, as well as. 
their knowledge of markets in their home countries. We.
foreign students have also helped the local economics, e.g.
rental, restaurants, entertainment.
Overall, I believe that it is a mutually beneficial policy.
