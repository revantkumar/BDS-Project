Thank you for proposing this rule! I believe the reason why America has become the most powerful country in the world is that it has gathered the greatest talents from all over the world. Some of the most talented young people in the world are among the international STEM students studying in American universities. This rule will attract more people like them to stay in America and make significant contributions. I believe US government and citizens are wise enough to realize this fact.
