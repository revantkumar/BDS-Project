OPT extension is a very good policy. For STEM students, before starting the actual working at a company, they need to have technical trainings and knowledge about the industry. They won't have enough time to really gain some practical working experience after that since the OPT without extension is only one year. On the other hand, for companies, they pay a lot to hire suitable employees and give them trainings. However, just after several months the employees have to leave the company because of the short time period of OPT without extension. It is not good for both of them.
