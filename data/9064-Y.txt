I support expansion of training opportunity for F-1 students. The F-1 students come to U.S in an attempt to realize their dreams since U.S. is a land of freedom and equal opportunities. The F-1 students have no intention of immigration. The current policy would put all the stay of F-1 students at risk because this would leave most of them no time to successfully apply for a working visa. The current policy is against the what this country is about and we would all hope to see that it can be resolved.
