I totally agree to extend the OPT for STEM international student. As we know, the STEM student are very smart and they should pay more effort into study to achieve a higher degree than other major. So less and less American citizen choose STEM major, I know lots of college student said that they hates mathematic. If US keep the STEM international student away, the high tech company will be effect a lot. As we know, there are lots of international employee works for big IT company like Google, Amazon, Facebook etc. And even some senior management officer are international employee. Cancel the OPT extension will make a really bad influence to these companies. 

The reason why the high tech company hire international student is not they prefer international student more than US citizen, it is because there are few of Americans chose STEM major. So extend OPT will not get rid of job opportunities from US citizen, it only provide more talent employee to American which can make US a better country.
