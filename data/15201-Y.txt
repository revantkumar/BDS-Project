Anonymous Anonymous I strongly am in the favor of this rule. American government and education system invests so much in these students too. The professors and administrators resources and time is spent on educating the bright minds that come to America in search of a better education. It would be wrong to waste this time and effort that is being spent. Having worked in the industry I can vouch for a fact that American people are not losing jobs because of international student hires. This rule would be great to retain the bright minds in this country for the benefit of the country.
