I strongly support this proposed rule which would improve and expand the training opportunities. 

1. It attracts more foreign students to come to United States and persuade degrees, which brings skilled people and funding directly to the US education system. The universities would have more money for research and financial aids to students (mostly from United States)

2. It enable more knowledgable and skillful students to work longer for employers in United States. Companies in United States thus truly benefit from the education system.

3. People are not burden to carry, people are the creator of the value of society. Don't be afraid of the incoming students and don't be afraid to let them stay.They will only boost the economy
