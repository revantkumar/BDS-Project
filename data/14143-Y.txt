I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons: I obtained an undergraduate degree in a STEM major and then proceed to get an advanced degree in a non-STEM field. Nevertheless, my technical background is critical to doing my job, which is patent prosecution. In fact, to become a patent attorney, I need to have STEM background in order to take the patent bar exam. Having only one year OPT would be very unfair to me. My job requires both a technical background and a law degree. The new proposal allows me to get a 24 month extension. My job is very important for America to remain the most innovative country in the world.
