As a State of Utah representative, I strongly support this new rule. It will bring in new economy and income to the states in America, and more job opportunities will be created by the big companies overall. The great new environment will boost our economy by utilizing the international students that we spend resources to train and educate. Do not let them slip away that easily, use their talents for our goods.
