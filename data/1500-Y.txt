I strongly support that the extension opportunities for international students with STEM degrees can be Passed! Because as an electrical engineering student, I really hope we can have more opportunities to connect with industry and do more practice. It is will significantly helpful if we can have the extension opportunities. For engineering, the experience for practicing is truly important, and we will make the best use of this experience when we go back to our own country to help develop the local industry. We help the industry to generate more GDP for America and the company can provide us the precious important experience. This is a beneficial process for each other. And we know the concern that if you give us more OPT extension chances, then the jobs left for American citizens will be less. This is absolutely not a problem you need to worry, because you can control the number of h1b and immigration to handle the issue. What we need is just some working experience, we can have some chances to put the knowledge and techniques in class into practice and real industry. In this way, we can be confident and pride to say that we bring some real staff to our own country and donate the precious experience to help develop the industry in our country. Also, we all see that when the opt extension was published, the economy of America was increasing and for now, the rate of unemployment is at the lowest of the history. People are getting more stable and richer life. And America is a country of immigration, generations of foreigners donated their whole lives to build this beautiful country. Although most of people here are the sons/daughters and grandsons/granddaughters of foreigners, America is becoming better and better. Again, OPT extension is beneficial for both the country's economy and international students. I hope this comment will be helpful to approve this extension.
