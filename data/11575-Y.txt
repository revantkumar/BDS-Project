This is a good step in favor of the country's economic growth. There is definitely a gap in STEM fields and who better to fill this gap than students educated in this very country. Ideally, there should be no lottery system and everyone above a certain salary level should be given the right to work in US. Keeping a salary threshold will automatically disallow suspect employers from abusing this amenity. A threshold of a relatively high salary (like a base of 65k per year) should be a good threshold for a STEM educated international student getting right to work in United States.
