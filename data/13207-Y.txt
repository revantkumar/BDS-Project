I strongly support this regulation for reasons below:
1. People influenced by this regulation are advanced STEM degree holders, and the knowledge and innovative ability they possess are vital in maintaining USA's global leading role in science and technology. 
2. It's simple math: large portion of these influenced people are/were financially assisted by US government or agencies. From a perspective of investment, it's definitely not a good idea to send them back to their mother countries to contribute to other nations' development, after all the resources US has provided. 
3. This extension is beneficial to American citizens too, in a long-term perspective. The STEM graduates are usually creative and entrepreneur spirited. The sustainable growth of job market does not rely on the short-term purge by suppressing talents from other countries, but rely on a sustainable growth of creativity and technology, which could benefit a lot from this regulation.
4. This regulation will attract the most talented people world-wide, from all backgrounds. And this is beneficial to race equality and help eliminate discrimination.
