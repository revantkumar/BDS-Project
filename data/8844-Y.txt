You say that foreigners are taking your high skilled jobs. Well, let me tell you this: Technical organizations here are facing shortage of skilled workers because many US citizens are not qualified to operate on these high tech jobs. In a competition between a US citizen and a foreign national who has the same degree of technical know-how, the organizations will always choose the US citizen over the foreign national because they do not have to sponsor for visas and spend extra money. They are hiring foreign skills because they can not find these skills in most of the citizens. So, its time the citizens better stop whining and if they think they deserve the job better than us, they learn those high level skills and compete with us on the same level. Nothing is stopping you!
