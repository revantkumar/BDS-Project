This rule will benefit both international students and the US. The country don't wanna just invest educational resources on international students and let them take what they have learnt here and directly contribute to other countries. If the country keeps those talented students, they will contribute to the US. Without the efforts of immigrants, the US cannot be such strong. The same, international students want to improve their abilities by having employment experience here. Americans don't need to worry about to be affected by this regulation. If you guys have the abilities that the employers are looking for, they won't hire international students. If you don't attract the employers, you still cannot find a job and someone else will take that position. That's the fact. Don't blame unemployment situation to immigrants.
