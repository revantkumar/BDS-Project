This is so apparent: I strongly support the proposal.

1. The government should let students who learned knowledge in the US and let them keep making contributions to this country.

2. This proposal will make all STEM ares in the US more competitive, which will in turn improve the global competence of US.

3. Many great scientists and engineers used to be international students in the US. This proposal will definitely help them to make more contributions to this country- this country need talents from all over the world, you cannot just count on yourself.

4. Diversity is important.
