I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. The prosperity of U.S. today is owing to its diversity. Different international students from different country have different talent that can help the U.S. industry from every aspect.The proportion of tertiary industry in U.S. is about 78% of the total GDP, and high-tech industry makes extremely huge contribution to tertiary industry. There is no doubt that extending the OPT for F-1 students will insure the working force for high-tech industry.
