I strongly support this rule because this rule brings a lot of benefits. First this rule helps to attract more international students come to United States for study or exchange. I will definitely recommend colleges in US to my friends or relatives who is deciding study in a foreign country if there is extension of training opportunities for non-immigrant students. Besides, this provides equal opportunity for all talented students to seek job in United States as well as employers to hire talented students. Last but not least, I believe this rule can help to improve economy in United States. More students coming to United State boost the economy. And also big technology projects need more students working on a long period. For these reasons, we should support this rule.

Thanks!
