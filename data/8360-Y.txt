One of the biggest advantages United States has is the diversity, it is a place where hard working people is welcomed. Compared with other nations, US is a place that everyone can compete equally regardless of nationality, skin color, etc, which is also one of the reasons why US can be the super power in the world. 
The OPT extension gives STEM students enough time to have some experience in their industry. It brings fresh blood to the job market, include many research institutions. We don't know whether there is a Albert Einstein there or now among those students who are using OPT to work right now. 
I support OPT extension, and hope more and more students with higher education can be treated friendly and equally. 
Thank you.
