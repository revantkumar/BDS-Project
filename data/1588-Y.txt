Linda Morrison There are so many people who are AMERICAN CITIZENS in the IT field who have been put out of a job when their employers hired cheaper foreign workers.My friend had to train his replacement at CISCO before he was fired. He has been unemployed or under-employed now for several years.

Our son studied computers and IT in high school. He was planning to continue his IT studies in college or technical school, but we successfully talked him out of it! Why? Because there is no future for American Citizens in this field. It would be a dead end. He could make a similar amount of money as a manager at a fast food restaurant, and not have to pay for additional schooling. If he studied IT in college, he would have to compete with third world workers who are thrilled to come to the U.S. and make $35,000, because of the other benefits of living here, and because of chain migration policies, they can bring their entire extended family.

This program is just a government subsidy for Big Businesses who want to import cheap labor, so they don't have to pay American Citizens a living wage.

This program should be ended. Certainly not expanded.

P.S. WHY does the personal information of the commenter, include a huge drop down menu to pick the commentor's country?? You are asking foreign citizens to comment on U.S. Government policy?
