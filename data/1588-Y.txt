To Whom it May Concern:
I would like to oppose the I.C.E.B. proposed rule to improve and expand training for F-1 non-immigrant students with STEM degrees and Cap Gap Relief for all eligible F-1 students. It would be unfair to citizens looking for work and jobs being taken by foreign workers. To extend the time for foreign "non-immigrant" students to 3 yrs. is grossly unfair to graduates from US colleges that should be eligible first. This would be very unfair to our job market with so many people out of work. Please do not pass this proposed rule. Thank you.
