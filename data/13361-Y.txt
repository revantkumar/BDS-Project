I don't think it's necessary to extend the OPT for another 7 months. 

From what I have seen, companies have been taking advantage of the cheap labor even on the premise that they are not going to support the H1B work visa. I've seen companies hire students that their majors do not match the business. However students still want to stay in the U.S. and look for other opportunities. 

The employment market get constant flow of foreign graduates to provide temporary services rather than stability and growth. And it's not helping the current unemployment rate. 

I petition that no extension on OPT for another 7 months.
