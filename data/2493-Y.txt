I strongly support this proposal. I believe many comments have made good points on why this is a much-needed proposal that will help the US in the long run. 
I also read some comments that oppose this proposal, in which people FALSELY associate their frustration (perhaps with the economy and the government) with the foreign workforce (and therefore the rule under review). This is not logical thinking, and if this kind of mentality gains more popularity and even prevails in this society, it will not only hurt the economy, but also undermine the foundation which this great nation is built upon. America is at where it is now because it embraces diversity, rewards hard working and innovation, and fosters an environment where people contribute to a better life of themselves as well as others. As a result, highly skilled workers outside of the US are attracted to work and live here, which in turn has boosted the economy and made not only themselves but also the American people better off in many ways. It is WRONG to think that foreign workers have stolen jobs from American citizens - after all the number of jobs is not a constant, but very well depends on the industry structure and the whole economy, and the ability to draw talented workers from certain fields (STEM in particular) is a competitive advantage that helps the whole economy to grow which in turn creates more opportunities to citizens. If one day US does shut its door to foreign talent pool, it is without doubt a time when US is no longer the greatest nation in the world, and when in fact US no longer can access the talented working force even if it wants. This is a vicious circle that should worry the opponents of this proposal more than foreign workers like me - I will move to a place that values and rewards my skills and ability without much trouble, but US will struggle to regain what it has right now.
