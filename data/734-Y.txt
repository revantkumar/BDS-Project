From my point of view, this new opt extension policy will definitely be a very positive signal on US economy. 

1. US is a immigration country. The reason for its success is because it has been absorbing tons of elites from different countries, beyond culture and race. This opt extension policy will definitely increase the opportunity for good international students to work in US, thus give this country new fresh blood. 

2. Someone might argue that this will cause increase of domestic unemployment. However, what I think is, we should broaden our views and think deeper. For example, if we have this great policy, more and more excellent international students will establish their own start-up companies and definitely it will get more domestic people hired. On the other hand, companies has priority on employing domestic employees, thus even with this policy, only the minority outstanding international students can stay. Those people who are against this policy are just too exaggerated. 

No matter how, I will support this policy. Thank you!
