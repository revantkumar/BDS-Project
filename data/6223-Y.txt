I strongly agree with the extension of the OPT program. I think one of the reasons why US has become the most powerful country in the world is because of the contributions the immigrants have made to this country. Those people against it are afraid of having a second Albert Einstein in this country. If US does not want such a person, other countries will definitely have him; it would be a great loss to US.

On the other hand, extending the OPT does not mean to rip people off from jobs. The US students still have every advantage to be what they are good at. I don't see why OPT would be an obstacle to the US students.
