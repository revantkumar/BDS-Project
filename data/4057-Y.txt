Great improvement of the immigration policy of the United States. More months of working time would enhance the performance of all F-1 OPT workers in their job positions, and be better for the US economics. Especially, this policy would help to maintain more international students with MS or PHD STEM degrees to contribute to this country, who mostly would take the high-tech job positions.
