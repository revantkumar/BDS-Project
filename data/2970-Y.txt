I strongly support the new rule. It is beneficial for the US society in a long run.International students are making huge contributions to US. US tech companies rely on international students to create values for their companies. And I don't think US citizens should worry about losing their job in all industries. On the contrary, it will help them to improve their capabilities in these beneficial competitions.
