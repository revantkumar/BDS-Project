I'm writing to urge the DHS to improve and expand the OPT for foreign nationals. So many american don't agree with it because they thought this would make the tech companies favor the foreign nationals than the local american. What I want to say that, the job openings of the tech companies are much greater than the graduated american students every year. By the way, when a tech company hire a foreign student, it will spend much more money and time than a local student. Because it should help the foreign student to get the working permit, so if you are the tech companies which one will you choose? You are having this negative thought because you see there are so many foreigner in the large companies. But these companies have to hire these foreigners, because no enough local student can meet their demands. Imagine, if the OPT for the foreign nationals didn't pass, what a big disaster for these tech companies and a big disaster for american economy. So I agree it and I'm an american.
