I am an agent working in bella vista apt, santa clara. http://www.bellavista-apartments.com/ I highly support this new rule.

Looking at the rental status of our apartment, over half of residents are college graduates or new workers with less than three years working experience. Concretely, most of them coming from foreign countries finished degree in US and started training here. Because of them, the rental markets are active, which is why I got hired and paid. I am really appreciated that they came, making a flowing job markets.

At personal side, I have some good friends with those new graduates. They are hard working and smart. Although it makes more competitive to our local people in working, it actually stimulates people for more and more hard working. People are not lazy anymore. In the long term, they are helping US development further.

All in all, I do support and welcome this new rule.
