1.Mutual benefits, the USA can benefit from my extensive knowledge and experience in data mining.
2.Enforcing cultural collaboration between the working environment and education environment.
3.Extending the cultural diversity and experienced professionals inside the working climate in USA.
4.Proving to the world the freedoms and liberties, justice and fairness, between all people of all ethnicity as provided in the American Constitution.
