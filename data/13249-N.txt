There are many talented and capable American students and American workers that could benefit from this kind of training/help. We should, at the very least, offer these opportunities to them. Foreign students who receive this training should agree to return to their own countries to work - to help their own countries. They should not use this program as a pass to stay in this country and displace the American citizens who need work. 
That being said, the Federal Government is not responsible to take care of everyone. Perhaps a "step back" is in order!
