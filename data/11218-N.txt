The Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. This program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job-training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. I oppose the proposed rule to extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, creating a bridge to a longer term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the pledge made by the foreign student when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough for American graduates to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition at lower wages to the mix.
