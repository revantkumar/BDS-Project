I support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The governmentshould let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.

2. Competition will make the United States stronger, not weaker.

3. Without the high-level technicians, more and more company will lose their core competitiveness.
