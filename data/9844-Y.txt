Mr. Anshu Ranjan
University Of Florida

I would like to submit the following comments in response to the USICE Proposed Rule, "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students," published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2015.

As an international student in the United States, I am pursuing a STEM degree and graduated (or will graduate) in 2015 with a PhD degree in the field of ComputerEngineering. The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.



I was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.

The OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates 

I strongly suggest that the new proposed rule for making the duration of STEM extension to 24 months is accepted. Students like me come to USA to fulfill their dreams of being successful and make a significant contribution to the society. USA has a history of helping such people realize their dreams and I truly hope it continues to do so. 

With this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.



Sincerely,
Anshu Ranjan
