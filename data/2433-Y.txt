It is an awesome rule!! I do support this. 

We hire the most talented young people around the whole world and make them contribute to America at the best time of their lives. I do not know why people object it. We do not give them a green card or a citizenship, this is just only 24 months training, which will make US universities more attractive and keep the high-tech field to develop continuously and pretty fast. This is how we make America to be most developed country. The CEO in our company is a India guy, who is talented and smart, make MS moved a big step in the last few months. We need diversity and new ideas.
