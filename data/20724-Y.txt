This is great rule that is vital to the US economy. It is critically important for our country to retain US trained talents. 

It will be a huge loss if we lose those F1 students after US university educates them. If they leave, foreign countries' competitiveness will be significantly strengthened and US greatly weakened. If they stay due to this rule, they will make contributions to the US economy, create more job opportunities for the American people. 

The STEM F-1 students are by no means a threat to American workers. The US job market has a huge shortage of STEM workers that American workers do not fill.
