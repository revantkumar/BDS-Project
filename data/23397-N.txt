We do not need more foreign workers in the U.S. What problem are you trying to solve? Not enough foreigners taking jobs from Americans? Is the U.S. labor participation rate too high for you?

For some reason our federal government is determined to get as many foreigners into the U.S. as it can. Our legal and illegal immigration totals are absurd - about 35 million in the last 20 years (including their children). 

The federal government is using extraordinary powers like executive decree to skirt immigration law. It is stretching existing programs like OPT to accomplish the same incomprehensible goal - flood the U.S. with foreigners.

Our STEM students are winding up in fields other than STEM (about 2/3 of them), because STEM has been rendered a false employment promise by H1-B and mass immigration, legal and illegal.

Federal agencies should know that we, the citizens are outraged by your actions. Personally, I would take strong actions against administrators and agencies which are working so hard to undermine U.S. workers.
