Strongly support. This new regulation can improve US strengths in many field in the long run. No reason US should evict genius people but accept illegal immigrations. Obviously, if US don't offer OPT Extension, those high degree people will benefit their own country with what they got from the US education after only 1 year they start to make contribution for the US. 

Technology companies will suffer from a tragedy if huge experienced hires suddenly leave their positions, while not enough Americans can be qualified in a short period. Many indicators show that economy downturn will come soon. Painful for those companies in Silicon Valley if lost so many engineers.

This regulation is not discriminating Americans, instead, US laws protect natives very well since there have been strictly restriction for foreigners working authority. Provide genius a chance, and let them devote to American people, why should we reject?
