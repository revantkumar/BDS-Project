International students gets to enjoy the resources and tax payer's money from their universities just like the native students. It doesn't make sense to discourage International students to stay and work to build the U.S. economy. U.S started as an immigration country, that's the root of its success. It wouldn't be a good choice to start shut the door to International students now, especially for those who are more qualified and work more diligently than their native competitors.
