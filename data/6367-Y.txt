Renxia Huang Since its founding the United States has always been admired for its welcoming and hospitable towards immigrants, as well as foreigners in this country. In return, these foreigners contributed enormously to this country and made the U.S. what it is, a strong and powerful country. The 21st century is an era of science and technology. To keep up with the pace of the world and lead the development of these high-tech fields, the U.S. need as many tech talents as possible, no matter where they come from.

Foreign students who graduate from universities in the U.S. with degrees in STEM majors are the most accessible and the biggest high-tech labor pool this country has. It would be a shame if the U.S. decides not to utilize this readily available resource. Besides, foreigners in the U.S. shouldn't be considered a threat to the local labor. Instead, they act more like a supplement that can amend what lacks from the local labor source.

Therefore, I support the rule to improve and expand OPT for F-1 students with STEM degrees.
