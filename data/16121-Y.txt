I totally support this proposal.

1. Many US citizens do not like to study STEM majors. They like Art, Medical and film more. Without this proposal, the amount of international students will decrease tremendously. Many technique companies could not hire enough person and will cause economic recession.

2. Many start-ups are created by international students which supply lots of job opportunities to both US citizens and international students.

3. This proposal will attract more and more international students to US and this will bring a large amount of income to universities.
