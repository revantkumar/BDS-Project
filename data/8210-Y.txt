As an international student, I first came to America because all kinds of voices are welcomed from different groups of people. I think OPT STEM should be extended because everyone should have the equal right to earn their job opportunities. Diverse culture and free competition is what keep this society strong and prosperous. Nothing is extreme, and at this case, I would say the benefits of keeping OPT STEM is greater than the harm. Firstly, international students can not only bring their skills to STEM field, but also contribute their vision culturally to assist business to gain more knowledge on international market. Secondly, free and open job market encourages people to be more competitive, there'll be more creative and innovative ideas under a diverse and open cultural environment. The "job market monopoly" only will make American companies less competitive and more difficult to penetrate international market.
