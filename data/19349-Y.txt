USA definitely needs opt extension rule for the following reasons:

1. This opt along with extension rule plays a very important part in attracting international students to get their education at United States. Once the advantage of getting industry experience is lost, United States will lose a part portion of international students which may also harm the academic development in many universities.

2. This is about the commitment that United States government has made. If the rule is forbidden, the students who has applied the opt extension will suffer. This will also make the students reconsidering their decisions of enrolling in educational institutions in US.

3. The duration of projects in industry is about 2-3 years in general. For example, I am a software engineer, usually it takes 6 months to have a good understanding of the code base of the company. After that, we need another couple of months to do some small projects and a real project will takes about 1-2 years which means if we don't have the extension regulation, the benefits of both student and company will be harmed.

4. Opt extension also means justice for all the international students. Companies mush enroll in E-verify to hire students who are in opt extension which makes sure that all the employees are treated same. It maximizes the reliability and ease of use of the system, while preventing unauthorized of personal information and unlawful discriminatory practice on national origin or citizenship status.
