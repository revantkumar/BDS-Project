Replacing American workers with H1B foreign workers is unAmerican. I'm appalled that this is legal. I lived in Australia for a year and they wouldn't allow any foreigners to take a job unless there was a shortage of Australians to fill the job. My mother lived in Mexico for 30 years and Mexico doesn't allow foreigners to take jobs from citizens either. Most countries don't. We have PLENTY of Americans skilled in the STEM professions. We have students graduating with STEM degrees and no jobs to go to. 

We all know the only reason H1B workers are replacing American workers is that they cost less. We have 95 MILLION Americans out of work. As long as that is true it is immoral and should be illegal to bring in H1B foreign workers.
