This is great! In my experience these young students are bright, knowledgeable, and eager to learn and to apply their skills. Under the current rule they often are distracted by their plans for the future, either trying to get a different visa to stay, or working on job interviews in their home country. This puts some unnecessary pressure on them, distracts from their work, and affects the productivity. Having them stay a few more months is in our best interest, and I hope this regulation will be in effect soon!
