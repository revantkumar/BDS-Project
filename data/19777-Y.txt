As a US citizen STEM worker I support this rule. Foreign students in science and technology area should are really making contributions to the product innovation. We probably wouldn't be able to hire enough people if this rule doesn't pass. I noticed some comment about lower salary for foreign students. But at least it is not true in our company. Both US citizen and foreign students receive the same salary, at least under my supervision.
