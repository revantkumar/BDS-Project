Jay Sharma This rule would be great for universities, economy of the states, and the growth of tech industries through globalization. It would attract the best talents from around the world and make America a true global country, increase culture sharing and promote prosperity in the millennia. I strongly encourage this rule as it stands wth everything America believes in, it is a country of immigrants and this rule is a great way to exposing the American tradition to the world. I really hope this proposed rule is implemented.
