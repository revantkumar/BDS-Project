Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students need to be improved and expanded because it is a benefit to our students as well as the whole country. Many students who has enthusiasm to work here have to go back and stop their career because they cannot get their H1-b before their OPT become invalidated. It has a very bad influence to the country's development especially in IT field. As we all know more than 50% of the positions in this field was taken by international students, which means that if OPT extension is canceled, most of the companies may not be able to find suitable employees instead and they will suffer from a hard time. America is a country that merge different kinds of culture, intelligence and talent people. That is why it became stronger and stronger these years and that is also why we love this country and be willing to service this country, but if we cannot get our deserved justify and opportunities here, it it such a disappointed thing. In a word, no matter consider from the benefit of the companies as well as the benefit of students, OPT should be improved and expanded.
