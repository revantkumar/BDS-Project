Zora Zhang I am a STEM PHD student at USC, and I strongly agree with the OPT extension rule. I see a lot of comments mentioning that this rule is harming citizens' working opportunities. BUT ACTUALLY IT IS NOT.

When there are two new graduates having similar capabilities, one is on OPT while another is CITIZEN, companies will still choose CITIZEN. It is ONLY when the OPT student has a MUCH HIGHER LEVEL OF TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITY than the CITIZEN and companies are IN NEED OF IT, the companies will hire the OPT student.

However, if the OPT has only 12 months, it is ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE for the OPT student to get hired EVEN IF his CAPABILITY IS FAR BEYOND CITIZENS'. Because in STEM majors, 12 months is TOO SHORT TO COMPLETE ANY DEEP RESEARCH/PROJECTS and no company would like to TAKE RISK OF CHANGING ANY CORE SCIENTISTS/ENGINEERS MEMBERS.

Moreover, since the TOTAL NUMBER of H1B VISA WINNERS of every year is NOT changing, the NUMBER of jobs that internals are taking IS NOT CHANGING, what it changes is ONLY the STEM RATIO.
