I think the extension for OPT is important for two reasons.

Many STEM students are important part of the U.S high-tech company. If the extension was to be canceled, not only many big companies will suffer from great loss of talents and employees but also their competitors are likely to hire those talents in other countries, which decreases U.S companies influence and markets. I know it's not obvious right now how much this could affect U.S economy, but give it time, it will happen.

Secondly, People who are against extension had their reasoning such as the immigrants are taking the opportunities of citizens. Now I think that's absurd since many of the U.S citizens don't even work in STEM areas. The immigrants, in the other hand, come here to fill the openings in the companies that U.S citizens don't even want to work for. Not to mention that many immigrants started their own business and hire U.S citizens which created more opportunities for the society.
