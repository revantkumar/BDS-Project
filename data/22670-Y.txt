I am in favor of this Proposal. America is a contry that welcomes different cultures around the world. Nowadays, lots of international students have come to America for education. Of course, America provides them educational resources. But they have also made contributions to America. Many international students like to gain working experience from companies in the USA. In this way, they can build a strong relationship with Amerian people. When they go back to their countries, they will be the bridge to connect the two countries more closely.
