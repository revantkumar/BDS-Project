Hello Sir,

I think this positive sign of immigration reform. I like to appreciate the decision of 24 months of OPT extension. The updated process steps look more accurate. Also for students it will give more flexibility to support the US economy in terms of technical source. This new process give students more chances to prove their capability and gain more expertise. 
Again thank you DHS for your hard work and come up with really good solution.

Regards
Harshil
