I am against this proposed rule for below reasons, 

1. This will give US local company to hire more cheap labors, as OPT does not have salary requirement as H1B visa. As a result, more USA local people will lose the job. 

2. People will take chance to stay at USA for longer time without any contribution, as OPT is also ok with no pay. Now there are lots of company ask for a little fee to hire STEM students as intern with no pay. Actually they does not really work for those companies. Those students then will be illegally hired by restaurants paying by cash that USA government will never know. 

3. One STEM students may take extra people come to USA since he can legally stay more than additional 2 years. His or Her spouse can apply for F2 and stay as long as his or her opt stem permitted, as a result, they may take chance to use USA Benefit such as medi-cal to birth baby to get USA nationalities, this is not good for USA society 

I understand government wants to keep high-tech gifted persons to work for USA, however offering 24 months extension is not a good solution, unless government can set up more limitations such as when coming into STEM extension, those students should be with pay and the pay should be above certain amount as H1B holder.
