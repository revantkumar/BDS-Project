STEM graduates have been proven to be a seriously significant part of American's high tech field. Contribution from those graduates are beyond measurable. However, due to H1-B cap, there are a great amount of students cannot have a great chance getting work visa during OPT period. So it has become extremely necessary to extend the length of OPT for F-1 students. That is the reason why I would highly recommend such rules. It is a big part of the future of U.S.A.
