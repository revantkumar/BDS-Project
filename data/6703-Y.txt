OPT extension is helpful and necessary for the economy development of US and foreign students.
As a new graduated from computer science majorI know that so many classmates are from countries like ChinaIndia and so on. As we knowmost entry level engineers are using OPT doing their work. Actuallyforeign students and engineers are doing jobs that native workers are not good at or interested.On the other hand,F1 students are not so competitive for the position which attracts native workers considering the language proficiencybackground and cultural gaps. That's why many STEM students just go back their country after graduate.We are living in a dynamic and communication time. Connectivity is the key word of development. I don't think so many talents would be willing to come to US if they just have 1 year to find job and have to leave if they are not so lucky to get H1B.
