John Sanchez I totally support the OPT extension. The Indian and Chinese students in my school are smart and diligent. It's better to keep them than to exile them. It's not wise to deprive international students of their rights to work in US. No one can deny that immigrants play a significant role helping US to be the most powerful country in the world.
