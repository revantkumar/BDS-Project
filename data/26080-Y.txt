This is great. This will attract more foreign students to come to US and pursue their degrees, which is good for the US economy. When students graduate, they can work in US for as long as 24 months and gain a lot of experience, which will help them in their future career. If they don't have this 24 months, or if they only have 12 months or less, more than half of them would not choose to come to US and study, and the experience they get from working only 12 months or less is not something that will help them in their future career.
