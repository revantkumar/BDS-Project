I strongly SUPPORT this proposal. 
As a international student, I came to America to finish my Master degree and do my plans based on OPT time (29 months) to pursue my dream job opportunities. Just like I bought a laptop and it claimed that it has 29 months guarantee against mechanical defect. I do not think the company have the right to cut the guarantee time to 1 year for those sold laptop. Clearly, this is unfair and greatly ruin customers' rights. In the same way, if government changed the rule and cut down OPT time for international student who already starts their degrees or during OPT time, those international students could protect their rights or claim compensation (tuition and their time) in any way.
