As a US citizen and an HR, I strongly support this proposal. Here's why:

1. There are many smart, hardworking F-1 students in our company. They are essential to us from a productivity perspective.

2. We were all immigrants. We fought our way to achieve the American dream, just as these students are doing now. Those who sit at home and complain others took their job is because they are not capable of doing what these kids are doing. We wouldn't hire them any way.
