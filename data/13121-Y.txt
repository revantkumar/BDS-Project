Dear Congress members, when do the American patriots (REMEMBER: people who ARE citizens of this USA ) get a break? You seem to favor (whenever there's a chance) to desire to assist someone OTHER than US citizens--why? Don't you remember that favorite 'old saying': "Charity begins @ HOME"? Wake UP--your job depends on it!!!
We U.S. citizens are getting so that we don't believe you (our US govm't) cares about your own 'home base' anymore! That's why Bernie Sanders is being heard (as a candidate for U.S. President) and supported by the people! What more do US citizens have to do to get ATTENTION? You've already disgraced this country before the world by that particular attitude! You've failed US! Sincerely, Sandra Day
