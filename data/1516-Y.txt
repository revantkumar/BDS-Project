That's really great to improve and expand the OPT for international students with STEM degrees. I am working in a big diesel engine company as a mechanical engineer. Every year my company hires a certain percentage of international students with strong academic and technical background. They contribute a lot to the company: bring new ideas with multicultural background, make communication easier especially for international company, and help the company and even the community become more diversified.
