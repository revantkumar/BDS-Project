There is no doubt that I would like to uphold the OPT extension. One of the reasons is that USA is the most open-minded country of the world, which attracts lots of talent and excellent people come here to change the world, especially the IT people. So I think the USA should be the one who gives these talent people opportunities to stay in USA. 

OPT extension should be a good way to retain these talents. I have one friend who was majored in computer science. He is really talented in software development. He got a job in USA after graduate but now he was in his homeland because he didn't get the H1B visa.Not only the company lost a talent software engineer but also he lost his first job. That would be detrimental for both sides. So I suggest that these talents should be get more h1b visa opportunity.
