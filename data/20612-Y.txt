As a native student, I have to admit that opt extension will not bring side effects to me and I would love to see my foreign friends work here to practice their skills.

On the one hand, companies will not hire more international students due to the low salary. Since opt extension is not sufficient for them to work as long as possible, companies have to apply H1B and even green card for these employees, therefore companies may have to pay far much to some extent.

On the other hand, opt extension will only apply to those e-verify companies which only make up of small portion of the job market. Local students are still free to choose. From my perspective, my friends are definitely talented and should get more time to train their skills.
