Support the 24 month OPT extension!

I found those international students who are qualified to apply OPT extension are highly educated people who contributed a lot to our U.S. society. They paid more tuition than us and expensive living cost. Moreover, they are talented people who improves our technologies, especially in IT and Science fields. They deserve the longer stay here and contribute more in both economic and technology aspects.
