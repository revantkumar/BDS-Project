Here is one international student holding OPT with master degree in chemistry, who just started to work two weeks ago. 

I definitely support the new 24-month extension for our OPT period. And I believe this will bring very good effects on American economy, because STEM majors nowadays contribute a lot to the economy of the world.

As I know, international labors account for a large ratio in STEM majors and US needs those labors, who can create great economics for US.

Moreover, for myself, as I already got the chance to enter a good company to apply my skills and experience gained from my master program. I enjoyed working in this company and I believe they enjoyed working with me too. After the one-year OPT period, I'm going to grow to be one experienced research chemist. I hope I can have a longer OPT period to transfer to H1B working status, because you know we can not guarantee to obtain that by one-time application. At the same time, my company must want to keep me once I become a experienced employee, who can bring benefits to the company. The old one-year OPT period obviously would cause some lost for my company and also most of those companies with international employees in STEM.

So in all, I definitely support this 24-month extension for those F-1 students in STEM.
