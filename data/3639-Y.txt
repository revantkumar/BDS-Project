I strongly SUPPORT this proposal for following reasons.

The government should definitely offer opportunities for international students to make contributions to the United States after their graduation. As government already pays a lot of resources to train those smart students when they were in school, it's a good idea to gain some benefits from those students by providing some chances for them.

Diversity of races is pretty important for the United States and it's even a symbol of the USA. Both international people or local citizen can make contribution to keeping the leading position of the United States in the world.

It does generate more competitions for US citizens, however competition is not bad for the United States in the long run. Competition actually can help the government to select smarter employees and enhance the average skills in the industry, which will lift up the competitiveness of the United States in the world.
