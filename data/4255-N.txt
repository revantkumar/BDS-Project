I know several of the MANY American unemployed workers. 
I do not support an on visas when we need to have our workers cared for .. they are citizens and deserve this.
The deserve a livable wage also.

We do NOT need to import more workers for tech jobs. In fact our workers need to get the current visa'd jobs back.

Please remember that US citizens matter first and foremost and need priority.
