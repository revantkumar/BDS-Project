I strongly advocate STEM extension. Opposing the opinion which is hold by many people of STEM reduces job opportunities of US citizens and eventually damage our welfare, I think approve STEM will improve overall life quality of US citizens.

As an obvious fact, the total wealth of United States is not fixed, but will vary according our productivity. More innovative we are the richer we will be. As selected talents, STEM candidates are better qualified than average people. Hence they will improve our overall productivity and make US richer. 

At the same time, since they are not citizens, they are not eligible for many of our social welfare. Thus we can save much money from them. Where will this wealth be? Our citizens! US citizens are the final beneficiaries

So it is very clear that we are a winner from STEM! And this is not the end. These STEM candidates are also the winner since they cannot get as good opportunities as they can get in US from their hometown. So they are willing to work for US and actually grateful! We are not forcing them, and thus not generating more social complaints!

Please don't be blinded by the investments we put in STEM, this is a good deal! Do not stop it!
