United States has always been a country with diversity, where people from all over the world study, work, and cooperate together. STEM OPT is really a good initiative since these nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees will greatly propel the development of the technology. Not only a thriving society needs natives, but also needs voice and thoughts from all over the world. I definitely support it!
