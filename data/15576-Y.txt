I strongly SUPPORT this proposal, because,

The United States is a country built up by immigrants. Providing open opportunities for F-1 students is one of the most important policies for the continuously attracting talented students from all around the world. 

In fact, when students are considering study abroad, European Countries and United States are both at the top of their lists. However, it is just the friendly policies to help international students to get more training from the local companies that prompts students prefer to the United States. All those international students contributed and are contributing so much to the economy and technology and science of the United States, instead of to Europe.

This proposal could benefit not only the F-1 students, but more importantly the United States.
