The OPT Stem doesnt directly relate to the immigration at all, on the contrary, it boots Americas economy from all aspects.

First of all, most of foreign immigration is not from those F1 students. The popularity comes from those illegally immigrants. Most of them didnt receive high education and they consume enormous natural and human resource. While for F1 students, they have to wait more than 6 years of work visa period to get a green card. Such long period frustrate those foreigners with high education degrees and most of them back to their home countries during this long period. So F1 OPT Stem doesnt contribute to high immigration rate at all.

Secondly, nearly 90 percent of F1 students are from wealthy families. The high education tuitions they pay for those colleges and graduate schools, not only increase the financial income for the educational institutions, but also bring numerous financial support for the laboratories and scientific researches. And one of the main reason more and more international students come to America for further education is because of OPT Stem can give them opportunities to make contributions to the scientific researches in all kinds of areas, computer science, IT area, medical area, finance area, etc.

Thirdly, due to the hard competitions of job market, lots of F1 holders cant get a job right after graduation in states, but the consumption they spend during OPT Stem period grows annually. The money they spend on the travelling, shopping, recreation such as going to football and NBA games is tremendous. Their consumption to some extent boots Americas economy revival.

OPT Stem is definitely a win-win strategy both for America and internal countries. It appeals more and more high educated foreigners to spend huge amounts of consumption in America and also bring knowledge for all cutting edge areas.
