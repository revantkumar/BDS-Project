Jyde Temo I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. I believe this increased period of practical training is important for students to fully develop their skills and find employment opportunities.
I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months because we need to give the best and the brightest students every opportunity to succeed in the U.S.

Beyond that, the extension will help firms in US build up their most-selective system of talents around the world. This is a long-term benefit to both US firms and US government. Since this does not require a lot budget to implement, but can help improve the productivity of the industry, boom up the technology and the GDP, therefore improve the US government.
