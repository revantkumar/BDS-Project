The Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.

By training foreign students here in the USA we are exporting our technology, in some cases to nations that intend to harm us! The H1-B program has had demonstrable FRAUD as my testimony before Congress in August of 1985. This program is even worse. This will dry up the opportunities for our citizen graduates. Many of the employers in Silicon Valley have been sued for non hiring agreements from other companies to restrain the salaries of US technology workers.
