I support the extension of F1 OPT STEM to 24 months. The US has spent a lot of money and effort educating international students, especially students who get scholarships, and those who get advanced degrees are very talented and could contribute a lot to the US economy, science and engineering. Extending F1 OPT STEM to 24 months is a win-win for both the US and international students.
