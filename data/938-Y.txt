We do not know nor can we safely know the true intentions of the influx of immigrants into our society. Neither do we do any sort of good job tracking the visa people after they expire. People with bad intentions meld into our society until the time they are needed to create confusion, hysteria, and mass destruction when they come out in the name of Allah. The Hispanic immigrants come and as a whole are good hard working people but still as we have seen countless times there is also the criminal elements getting here as well. The proposal to send up to 100,000 Syrians to the US is mind blowingly insane as most do not even have papers to show who the are. More and more we are hearing of the Muslims taking over our communities and trying to change our laws to be second to Sharia laws provoking their freedom of speech when in fact Islam has no freedom of speech.
STOP THIS MADNESS NOW.
