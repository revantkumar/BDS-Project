This rule with OPT extension to 24 months should be established as legitimate by the government. The country welcomes diversity and spends tremendous amount of money and resources on educating foreign students. Without OPT and its extension, these foreign students will have no choice but go back to their home country upon graduation. What's the point of providing education and skills to these talented students but not letting them contribute to the country's economy? The tech companies will suffer a lot if foreign students do not have legal visas to work in the country.

I am in strong favor of the proposed rule. On top of that, the extension should be expanded even longer to accommodate those who already have jobs. It will be a huge waste of money to the companies who have hired foreign students but have to let them go because of visa issues.
