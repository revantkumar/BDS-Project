I strongly support improving and extending OPT.
Everyone says that US is a free country, and so US should show its will of freedom and allow international students have the freedom and opportunity to contribute more to US. Competitions will always exist even if US does not extend OPT, and so extending OPT will not worsen the situation. Instead, extending OPT will let companies have more diversified staff who have more competence, thus improving the development of the country. US citizens have already had so many prestiges, and international students are not treated fairly sometimes. YOU NEED TO MAKE REAL EFFORTS TO GET JOBS INSTEAD OF SQUEEZING INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS' OPPORTUNITIES! Lots of international students who want to stay are willing to make efforts and work hard without complaining. So US should give them more opportunities, and treat those people who want to contribute to this country more fairly!!
