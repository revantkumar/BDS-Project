I do think that the extension is necessary for the following reasons:
1. A supportive policy can really prevent intelligent foreign students from leaving the U.S.. OPT will actually create more positions for the public because of the technological advances from these students.
2. In the American spirit, everyone should have equal rights. The extended OPT will give foreign STEM students more opportunities to contribute to the U.S. society.
3. It's good for U.S. economy and education because these talented foreign STEM students will contribute more advances to these fields.
