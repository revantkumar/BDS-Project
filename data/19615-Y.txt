As an EE student, I strongly support the OPT extension!
Firstly, we have to face a fact that most local students are unwilling to work as an engineer or scientist. However foreign students, especially major in STEM, are just fixed in these job vacancy, which may help improve the American economy and tax income. So far as I know, most of the scientific and technical corporations consists of more than 50% foreigners and most of them have been there after their abroad study. Therefore I think it is unwise to chase away the foreign students.
Secondly, from the China Daily, we may know that chinese government is making the new 2025 manufacturing plan to focus on the semiconductor industry in the future, which aims to be the top in the world. It is a chance for China but challenge for America, which with the better welfare offered by chinese factories, more and more chinese students will be pleasure to go back home. As a result not only the innovation level of the America will decrease but also the industrial competitiveness will lose.
Further, since the tuition from foreign students takes great part in the university income, if we fail to pass the OPT extension, it would dampen the enthusiasm of foreign students to study in America so that the loss of students will finally reflect into the education expense in universities.
In general, the OPT extension have everything to gain and nothing to lose.
