I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The governmentshould let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S..

2. Diversity is veryimportant for the U.S, a lot of world renowned U.S citizens are not born in the States at first.

3. Competition doesexist, but is not a bad thing.
