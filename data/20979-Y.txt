I support expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students. 

Only one reason, our company needs more employees! I work for an IT company, and there is a trend that there are not enough local American students choosing IT related majors. The F-1 nonimmigrant students contributes a lot to my company's head count. We really need this policy to continue to attract students from all over the world. Otherwise I do not even know how could our company manage to get so many new grads!
