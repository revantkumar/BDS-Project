We tried so hard and paid so much to be here just for a real free life that we can be what we are, be paid for how much we devoted, would not be discribensted for who we are and where we are from. And now the anti-OPT extension people is proving to us that what the good things like fair and justification we thought about USA are wrong. Think about it, if we are so cruelly disappointed even though we worked go hard for what we deserved(honestly it's already been hard and discriminating enough for an international student like me), and lots of people are even trying to make it harder, I would say, not we are losing something, this country is losing more, especially the assets that made this country so strong in the past 200 years. A bad decision not only could stale the development of the country, but also drag it decades backward. Cancellation of OPT is so unfair for thousands of hard work in international students like me, for those companies who appreciate the hard work of international employees and the whole USA.
