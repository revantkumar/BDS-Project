I strongly SUPPORT the new proposal for the following reason:
1. Lots of international students only need to have work experience for a short time in the U.S., then when they get back to their own country, they can get higher salaries, but companies' projects and programs usually lasts more than one year. If the new rule is applied, then international students can have work experience without applying to H1B visa to finish their projects, and then go back to their own country, which will release the job opportunities faster to new graduates that contains mainly U.S. citizens.
2. Competitions can provide companies with chances to hire better employers, which improves the products and services quality overall throughout the U.S.
