I strongly support this rule, and here are my reasons.

I am a manager at a Los Angels based technology startup and I spend a large amount of time recruiting engineers. I have to admit that our recruitment process is a bit biased against the international students, but we hired 4 of them for the past year.

Why biased against international students with OPT status? They will have to leave the country if they won't win the H-1b lottery. It will be a lost for the company.

But WHY do we even consider them at the first place? They are simply the BEST. We are so happy to have them and they have contributed so much to the success of our company.

The reality is that our education system simply can't educate enough qualified engineers. Even if we don't have the OPT program or STEM extension, I would still refuse to lower the bar to hire less qualified works. Also, I would strongly support having those qualified international students a way to stay in America and to better contribute the posterity of OUR country.

I understand that some organization is angry that we do not hire more American works. I don't think there is anything wrong with the STEM law. Rather, it's a problem that is rooted in our education system. Make international students out of this country won't help. Instead, they will make their home country better and eventually make the U.S. less competitive.
