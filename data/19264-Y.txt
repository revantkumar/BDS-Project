This a a fantastic policy and should be strongly supported. 

According to the research of NAFSA, the international students SUPPORTED 340,000 JOBS and contributed $26.8 BILLION to the U.S. economy during the 2013-2014 academic year, International students not only contribute economic value, they build bridges between the United States and other countries; bring global perspectives into U.S. classrooms and research labs; support U.S. innovation through science and engineering coursework, making it possible for U.S. colleges and universities to offer these courses to U.S. students; and support programming and services on campus for all students by paying out-of-state tuition, funded largely by non-U.S. sources.

The policy not only becomes an incentive to attract more excellent and outstanding international students, but also support the U.S. economic development.
