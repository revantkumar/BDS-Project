OUR AMERICAN CHILDREN/GRADUATES need jobs/careers NOW. THOUSANDS of Graduates CANNOT FIND WORK
in the US due to the economy, cutbacks and deficits over-the-top. F-1 visas are TEMPORARY and the current
months allowed are CORRECT, any increase will FURTHER JEOPARDIZE the employment of our US GRADUATES.
PLEASE DO THE RIGHT THING and OPPOSE THIS BILL.
