I strongly SUPPORT the OPT extension for 24 months. International students bring talent from all over the world, those who have received degrees and have found jobs after graduation are more valuable and are improving our country. Giving these students OPT allows them to change their status in a reasonable timeline. I don't see the disadvantages. They will not steal the jobs opportunities from citizens, since there is much more demand in STEM related job positions. They are high quality supplements.
