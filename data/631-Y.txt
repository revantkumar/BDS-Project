Doris Huang I strongly, enthusiastically support this action. It is absolutely an awesome, amazing and outstanding action which will bring considerably significant benefits to America and its economy. According to what I see and learn from the surroundings, Internet and newspaper, the international students contribute greatly to the U.S economy. Besides the high tuition fee they pay to the United States, they also prompt the local economic prosperity. They are the active consumers. They pay the rent, eating, buying cars, taking tours in America. All of these activities can certainly improve the revenue of the local government. I can not figure out why some people say no to all those benefits. All in all, I extremely and enthusiastically support the action to expand the training opportunities for F1 students. I really hope more and more international students can regard the United States as their first choice.
