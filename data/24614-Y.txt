I strong support the STEM proposal and believe that it benefits the U.S. development and growth in STEM areas and will not hurt american citizens' chances of getting a job in STEM areas. Tons of employers do NOT offer sponsorship for international students who are already challenged by language and culture problems and have to depend on STEM to work 1-2 years in U.S.
It's really about an individual's fit for a position, skill-wise and knowledge-wise. I graduated from a university that's distinguished for its tech education and none of my American peers had any difficulty getting into Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, or such big game companies.
Again this proposal has my full support and I hope and believe it'll be approved with the support of any sane international and american involved who know this is for the best of the U.S.
