I strongly support this rule.
Without STEM OPT extension, the risk of not getting H1B is too high for international students and discourage them to come to US to study.

Having more international students is beneficial to US education both financially and academically. 
Furthermore, STEM OPT extension will definitely help the international students to contribute to the advancement of US technology after their graduation.
