Zhiwei Liu This extension of OPT will obviously benefit United States. As the only superpower in the world, our country need the best talents in the world, especially in STEM fields, to keep the competitive edge of our country. Continuing the flow of foreign-born scientists and engineers into our country is therefore paramount if our country is to maintain its competitive edge. If we failed to attract and absorb these higher-educated students in STEM fields, they would leave our country and serve our competitors. If we go backwards and scrap the OPT extension, then it means handing our competitive edge to our competitors especially communism China, and this is unacceptable. These higher-educated students in STEM fields are not like refugees living on welfare, they can definitely make United States a better country with their hands.
