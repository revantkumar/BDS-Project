Samantha Walker Our country has reached on top of the world because of the technology and because of this rule actually the whole world is contributing towards the technological growth of our country. I think this is a great step by DHS which would definitely promote new inventions and innovations in field of science and technology. There is no doubt that to advance our economy and our society we need to create the next great technology innovations, not just consume them. That's why there is such urgency for the U.S. to develop a stronger workforce of experts in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Raytheon Chairman and CEO William Swanson said at a Massachusetts' STEM Summit last fall, "Too many students and adults are training for jobs in which labor surpluses exist and demand is low, while high-demand jobs, particularly those in STEM fields, go unfilled.". This suggestion will not only give the F-1 students more time to win the H1B lottery but also will increase the revenue of US companies specially in tech and engineering fields significantly. This is essentially great help to US economics growth.
