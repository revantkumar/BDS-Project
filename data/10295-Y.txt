I strongly support the proposed expansion of the optional practical training (OPT) program! US needs a larger tech-savvy workforce to maximize economic growth. Also, with the development of globalization, US companies still needs many employees in different background with the same passion, these people will play an important role in improving and innovating the company culture! These international students deserve this opportunity!
