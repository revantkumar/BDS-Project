The USA was started as a nation of immigrants and has benefited tremendously from the influx of foreigners who start off in this nation wanting nothing more than to work and contribute to this society. We are now living in a day and age where other nations are fast approaching and challenging America's leadership in many STEM fields and whether we like it or not, we can only benefit from attracting the world's best and brightest to study and contribute to our nation instead of foreign nation. To me, this isn't about immigration, but about securing America's status as a nation where intellectuals of the world can go to for a safe and free place to innovate and achieve what they can't in their homelands. For me, this is also a personal issue as I come from a family of immigrants and I have first hand experienced the generosity and freedom that this nation is capable of. We should be setting a model for the rest of the world on how to treat intellectuals who just want to work, not kicking them out and letting other nations benefit from their skills. I want America to be great, and to do so, we need to attract the best and the brightest from around the world. This rule change is just one step in many that I support. Recent graduates should be allowed to experience working in an American workplace where personal freedoms are respected and individual entrepreneurial-ism is encouraged, along with gaining the knowledge that they'll need for the rest of their lives. Plus, we forget that these are still, at their base, people who came from many thousands of miles away just for a chance at a better opportunity. Our nation is the one that has the Statue of Liberty declaring to the rest of the word: Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me. It's time that we as a nation live up to these words, and this small act is just one step.
