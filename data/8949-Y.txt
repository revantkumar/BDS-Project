Yang Cao I am a student major in computer science, I am fully agrees with this change to extend the OPT stem to 24 months. It's not just 7 more months, it's actually helping US economy, without the help of foreign stem students, it's hard to fulfill the need of US market. It's true that this will affect US citizens a bit, but we can't focus on this, we should focus on how this will help the whole US society.
