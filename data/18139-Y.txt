Hello officer,

I strongly agree with this new proposed rule mainly due to the fact that F-1 nonimmigrant students will certainly benefit local industry and business by helping reduce the disbursement of companies and institutions, which is also a great opportunity for student themselves to sharpen their academic skills and gain more real-life experience in their study field. 

Thank you.
