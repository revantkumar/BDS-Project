Todd Wade International Students added a whooping 26.8 billion dollars to US economy in a single year of 2013-2014. Our country has reached on top of the world because of the technology and because of this rule actually the whole world is contributing towards the technological growth of our country. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. There is no doubt that to advance our economy and our society we need to create the next great technology innovations, not just consume them. That's why there is such urgency for the U.S. to develop a stronger workforce of experts in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). One of our richest sources of employment and economic growth will be jobs that require skills in these areas, collectively known as STEM.
