Jing Yu I am writing this comment to fully support this proposal of STEM OPT improving and expending. 
1. US is a nation full of diversity and fusion of hundreds nation's culture. This proposal will further improve the diversity in US campus, and in STEM major companies.

2. The competition from International students can bring much greater benefits than the short comings. 

3. Negative impact on US large corps and companies will be huge if we fail to have this proposal passed. Thus US economy will have a foreseeable disaster if all STEM OPT students have to lose their jobs because of this
