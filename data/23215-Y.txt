After reading the whole rule, I strongly support the rule for the following reasons.

1. It's good for the United States economy. As more and more talented students come and work for US technology companies, the whole industry will grow fast and create more profit as well as opportunities. With students from different countries, new areas in the industry will be exploded and international business will also be benefited. Not to mention foreign students are also a strong consuming power themselves.

2. It's good for the United States education. Every year, foreign students in STEM fields bring a considerable amount of financial sources(i.e. tuition). With these financial sources, universities and colleges can have better teaching resources and better facilities and equipments. And only the best of the best foreign students may have the opportunities to come to United States. They contribute a lot to STEM fields in terms of researches and new ideas. lnd Longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in US.

3. It's a right decision under the core value of United States. The core value of United States, based on my understanding, is equal opportunities. Everyone studied in United States should have the equal chance to practice their skills. Indeed, some people may have the concern that this rule increases the competition in the STEM job market. However, competition is healthy for long run. Also, some of the projects may take 3 - 5 years to complete. One year OPT time is not enough for most technology companies.

Based on the above three reasons, I strongly support this rule.
