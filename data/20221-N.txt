"America for Americans" is an old isolationist slogan that rings especially true now regarding American jobs.

America doesn't need foreign workers who are allowed in and hired just to depress wages. Any politician who votes on immigration issues for the sake of "big business" or cronyism should face TREASON charges at the very least. TRAITORS look out for the interests of others not their electorate, and too many in congress allow others (with lots of money to spend except to pay their employees) are today's living TRAITORS and should be charged and tried as such.

There, I've had my say. The time has finally arrived for elected officials to do what is right and just for the American people and reject the influence of crony capitalists, charge them with TREASON when the seek to influence your votes against the benefit of your constituents.
