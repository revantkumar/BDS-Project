I agree with the proposal. It is important to non-immigrant students, especially for those with high knowledge level and willing to contribute to the US. Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students can offer them with more chances as well as time for job-hunting. Competition said by native people cannot be considered as a reasonable excuse. It is so stupid. Without the help of international scholars and workers, is it possible for the US to make progress???
