I support helping immigrant students to become legal residents. They need to be given any aid needed to graduate from high school 
with a degree they can read. They need to be taught all of their multiplication and division tables by the time they finish 3rd grade
They need to be taught to read phonetically - both English and Spanish by the time they finish 3rd grade. When it is time for college
they need to be eligible for any scholarship without regard for their legal status.
