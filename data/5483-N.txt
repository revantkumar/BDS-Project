We vehemently oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. 

This is totally Ridiculous ... there is NO Valid reason to make these types of rules which punish American Citizens and deprive them of jobs. And to make the students and employers exempt from Payroll taxes is even worse. 

I don't know WHY any American citizen in a position of authority could sign off on something like this... they obviously would not be thinking of the future of American children.

This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. 

Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.
