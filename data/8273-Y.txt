Chloe Simpson Our country has reached on top of the world because of the technology and because of this rule actually the whole world is contributing towards the technological growth of our country. The proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow them to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. Raytheon Chairman and CEO William Swanson said at a Massachusetts' STEM Summit last fall, "Too many students and adults are training for jobs in which labor surpluses exist and demand is low, while high-demand jobs, particularly those in STEM fields, go unfilled.". Hiring international students does not mean stealing jobs from Americans. I personally did not see ANY American students with STEM degrees and decent GPAs get unemployed. This rule will strengthen the relationships between America and other countries. That is, they can share more information, more resources and more opportunities.
