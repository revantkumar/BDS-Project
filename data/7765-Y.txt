qiaoping yang I strongly support the rule of Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. My reasons are as follows:
America has been a country that encourages creativity aninnovation since it was founded in 1776. Thomas Edison, Bell and other inventors like Bill Gates have changed the world. The expansion of Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees will make the American companies that employ these students to be more creative. The progress and development of human society mainly depends on scientific innovation and creativity and these stem students are likely to become potential inventors. The expansion of their OPT will enable them to work on scientific projects and design better products, which will make American economy more dynamic. The students are now doing their internaship but some them are likely to work out cures for cancers and other deadly diseases that threaten human beings in the future.
