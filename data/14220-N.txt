I am appalled at the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. There is no shortage of STEM workers in the United States nor has there ever been. This proposed rule will make it even more difficult for domestic graduates and seems to offer only benefits to corporate interests. I oppose this proposed rule.
