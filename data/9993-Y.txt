Huan Fan I strongly supports this regulation, but it is not because I am an international student myself. Without this regulation, I could only work in the US for a year, which does not worth the company's effort to hire and train me without planning on a H1B visa in the long run. But with an extension of 2 year, which makes my legal stay 3 years in total, I don't see a H1B visa necessary, which saves both time and energy for me and the company. With 3 years of working experience in the US, I will be happy to go back to my own country and will be in a much better position in finding a job. I believe this is a four-win: for international students, companies who need highly-educated STEM workers, US education system (programs will be more attractive to international students comparing to UK or Australia or Canada), and the original countries where the foreign students are coming from.

I understand many US citizens were worried about the job market but let's be honest, if you have two candidates who are mostly equal in their professional skills, won't you hire an US citizen which saves you a lot of filing/legal issues? Also there are regulations that employers need to demonstrate that they are not able to hire US citizens for that position before they hire an alien. STEM international students are in no way competing with veterans in terms of job searching.
