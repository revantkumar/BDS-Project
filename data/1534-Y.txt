I strongly SUPPORT this rule for the following reasons:

1. It will benefit the US job market by: 
-keeping the talents in this country;
-more competition means bigger incentive for either US citizen or foreign aliens' well performances at work; 
-data supports that foreign-born STEM workers are also great job creators; expanded OPT will allow them prepare for entrepreneurship without worrying about visa issues in their early career lives.

2. These foreign students are NOT stealing jobs from American workers. A longer OPT doesn't mean a privilege for the foreign students; instead, it is simply a way to level the playing field. Equally talented foreign students have much less chance to stay and work in comparison to their American counterparts-only because of "visa issues"; this itself is not coordinate to the non-discriminative work rules. 

3. A lot of foreign STEM students are supported by scholarships-we pay them to learn our skills, and send them back to their home countries right away. Is that fair for us?

4. A short OPT time will discourage foreign STEM students to come in and study; in the short term, we are losing a great portion of tuition money; in the long run, we are shutting the doors for talented young people to come in.

5. I am shocked by how rude some comments are here by equaling the foreign STEM students to illegal immigrants--sigh.
