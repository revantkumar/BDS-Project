I am a professor in one of the nation's top universities in the STEM field. I strongly support the new proposed OPT extension rule because it is essential for me to recruit graduate students and post-doc researchers.

Every year I have a tough time recruiting students and post-docs to conduct research in my lab. I always have more funding than needed to spend. There are always few domestic students in my department, and quite a proportion of them quit the program after a few years because they think the STEM subject is "too difficult". The remaining are always granted with national fellowship and are very picky about the research projects. As a result, it is almost impossible to recruit domestic students to conduct research in my lab.

Thanks for the OPT extension program, my university, although located in the unattractive and remote mid-west, can attract the best students from outside US. Most of them are down-to-earth, willing to do the hard, routine laboratory work. The OPT extension program will be a big big attraction for them to choose to study US. In addition, I can also recruit post-doc researchers. All of my on-going projects require a minimum of two years to complete. The OPT-extension program allows me to recruit recent graduates without worrying about sponsoring their working visa. This is a great benefit for me, not only saving the cost of running my lab, but also greatly expands the pool of extraordinary candidates I can select from.

I really believe that the OPT extension program is beneficial for the academic research in the US. It is really strategic and essential to ensure that our nation can continue to attract the best brain powers from the world to maintain our leadership in technology in the world.
