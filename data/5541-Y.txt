I strongly support this proposal, the reasons are:

1. United States is a nation built by immigrants. It is time for her to boost the immigration reform like she used to do for all those years back instead of closing the doors for those who wish to contribute their efforts to this country.

2. OPT extension is only targeting for F-1 STEM students, who are highly educated, creative and knowledgeable. They can make tremendous contributions to the country. Please note that the reason why US is so powerful today is because she welcomes all the competent people from all over the world. Disapproval of OPT extension program will dramatically diminish this.

3. Many cites that employing foreign students cost 4 billion dollars lost for medicare and social security. While this point of view ignores the fact that foreign students pay their own tuition without any federal/state fund, contributing way more than 4 billion dollars to the US economy. Let alone they actually need to pay more federal taxes because they are non-resident aliens who do not have any allowances/exemptions.

4. OPT extension program greatly promotes the scientific innovations in the US. Without this program, I couldn't imagine how some of those big IT companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook can survive.

All in all, I sincerely hope that this OPT extension program can be passed, for the future of the United States and all the American people.
