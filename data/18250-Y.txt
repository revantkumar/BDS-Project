If U.S. wants to keep the leading position in science and technology, it should keep an open mind and welcome talents from all over the world, no matter he/she is an American or a foreigner. Extending OPT is a positive policy to make a better environment for the foreign talents who can contribute to U.S. economy and creating more job opportunities for American people. I strongly support this policy.
