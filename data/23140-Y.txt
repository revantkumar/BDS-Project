Many people are concerned that the rule will effect the employment rate of US citizens. However, I think it is beneficial for both US and international students.

According to the policy of STEM, the STEM students can only work in tech-related areas, and the tech people are in a great need in all over the world. Having them working at US companies and making contributions is profitable for the development of economy and technology of US.

Besides, the competitive atmosphere will encourage or urge both US and international students to build themselves up if they want to have a nice job. The competition will level up the quality of employees in the job market and is also helpful for individuals.
