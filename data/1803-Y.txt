When I was considering coming to USA for Bachelor degree, I thought OPT and its extension is a great opportunity for my career preparation when I go back to my country. But now it's facing the problem of being cancelled. It's unfair for the students. It's really hard for students like me in computer science to work in my country without enough experience.
