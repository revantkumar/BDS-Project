I strongly agree with the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should give opportuniyies to those graduated international student to make a controbution to this country. They are the best students from each country.

2. United state of america benefit from immigrats with high technology background or STEM majors since world war two. For example, Albert enstain as well as millons of international students.

3. STEM students who work for this country have been subjected to very strict screening process to protect native america from losing jobs to these people. I believe they also make every ameican competitive human beings.

For the above reasons, this proposal definitely brings challenges as well as opportinities and benefits for our country.
