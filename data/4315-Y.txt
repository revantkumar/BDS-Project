Frankly I think OPT extension is a good thing for American people. A lot of international students only want to experience what working in the field look like and go back to their own countries. Frankly, some of the jobs are mostly done by people from other countries for a reason: there aren't enough Americans to do it. Just use international students as some labor for America for a few years and get them back to their countries. That's really for the best of both parties.
