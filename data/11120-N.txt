Our government has forgotten what made this country great. It's we the people not we the government. Approximately 40% of the Millennial College Graduates are unemployed. They are the future of this country and we need to insure that they have one. Foreign students should be welcomed to get an education but not at the expense of the American citizens. We are only as strong as our weakest link and we creating weak links throughout this country. Tolerating this rule to be expanded would not be in the best interest of our children or our country.
