I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. It will increase will increase the competency for both private section and non-profit organization in United States, which could select outstanding employees from the foreign graduates without worrying about their visa issues. This is a delicate mechanism design to bring United States the top talents from the world, and maintain the economic growth.
2. This proposal will improve the national power and influence of United States. The foreign graduates, who go back to home country after the longer working experience, will promote the influence of the economical and cultural power of United States enterprises. This will expand the market for these companies in United States, and bring more revenue to the companies. So more job opportunity will be created for resident and citizens in United States. 
3. This proposal will increase the competency for United States higher education vs other countries. It will attracts more international students, and bring the revenue for both public and private schools.
