I am strongly supporting this proposed rule. I am a STEM Ph.D student in The Ohio State University (OSU), and after my graduation I will go for an OPT. In my opinion, OPT is highly important for every STEM student because it provides more opportunities for students to find employments, especially when the quota of H1B is becoming more and more limited for foreign skilled empolyees and researchers during these years. We come here to proceed the technical and scientific progress, and our work will definitely thrive the economy and create more jobs in the United States. I am pretty sure all US citizens will get benefit from our work. I really hope such a win-win collaboration will last longer and that's why I strongly support this proposed rule. I believe almost all the international students and researchers with STEM majors share the same point of view as me.
