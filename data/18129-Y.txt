I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm currently an international computer science master student at NYU. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my master degree in US and British. The reason why I dont choose British is it could not provide me the industry training opportunity after graduation. If I cannot participate a industry training after graduation in US, why dont I go to British or other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents? So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Moreover, OPT provide a long enough time for graduate students to participate industry training. During the OPT, students need to rent an apartment, buy a car and many other things. They will make great contributions to US economy.

Beside my opinions, I dont agree that foreign students might work under optional practical training without maintaining legal status. First, foreign students need to fill lots of documents to apply for the OPT. Second, any company hiring F-1 students have to confirm the status of foreign students are legal. If any company violate the rule, they might be punished. Why do they take a risk to hire a foreign student without legal status? Moreover, there are many rules in the new OPT extension rule to prevent this thing happen. Not only foreign students are benefited from this new rule, but also universities, companies, the society and US citizens.

Hope more people support this good rule!
