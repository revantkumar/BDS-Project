I totally support this policy. I am a local American and I can tell my own story to show you why this policy would benefit us.

I live near a university. When I was a kid, most students in that university are local Americans. People come to school and then go back home at weekends, life was ok. But these years,there are more F-1 students coming, and they brought my neighborhood a fortune. The need to live, they need to eat, and they are willing to purchase. My parents rent their old house to 3 F-1 students from China, and getting a fortune for that, and please mention renting this old house is almost impossible when I was a kid as everyone had their own place! We love to meet new people and we especially love to see them making our live better and wealthier. That's why I totally surpass this OPT extension policy.
