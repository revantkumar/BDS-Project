Betty McDonald I strongly SUPPORT the OPT-extension for the following reasons: 

From the statistic data of our college, the number of international students has dramatically increased in recent years. In my opinion, an important reason for such choice is that U.S. provides a better opportunity of training to international students after they graduate from colleges or graduate schools. Such professional trainings in industry are very important to international students, because it greatly improve their competition ability when they go back to their country to find a good job. However, without the STEM OPT extension, this post-graduate training will be reduced by 67%, which would greatly devaluate the education in US to international students, thus decreasing the chance of education institutions in this country to attract the best students. This would be a lost to international students, but a bigger lost to US education institutions.

Secondly, it significantly stimulates the local economy. Usually when I worked, I spent more than 400 dollar per month for rental. 200 dollars for food, clothes and transportation. All these contribute a lot for local economy.

So, if those people really need something to worry about, this is what they are supposed to worry about: why not spending more time improving their own skills set those companies are looking for instead of wasting time leaving negative comments here? Competitions are everywhere in the world. Tech companies will never hire you if you are not qualified regardless of your citizenship! Only the strong survive!
