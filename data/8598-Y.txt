I strongly support the proposal simply for the fact that most international students (STEM major) who attended school and obtained an advanced degree from US universities are excellent professionals in their own fields, and US should let them stay longer if they want to contribute to US economy. It is not wise for the US government to shut doors for those young and brilliant students/early professionals who wish to contribute while embracing other-category immigrants, for the sake of the nation's future.
