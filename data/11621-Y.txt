I strongly SUPPORT the OPT-extension for the following reasons: 

1. Technology is the key factor for developing American economy. Hiring more STEM student is helpful for improving Technology which in turn creates more jobs for people in US.

2. Besides, it turns out that out of all potential international employees, only 19% of them could stay and get a working VISA from the lottery. Most of them will eventually go to their home country and work there, leaving a lot of vacancies for newly graduated students.
