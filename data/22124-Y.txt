I strongly support the OPT program, as far as I know, the international students need to be very outstanding even just to get an interview. The U.S. companies give much more preferences to the local candidates which makes it extremely hard for international student to find a job in U.S. (many big companies in U.S. are no longer sponsor H1B visa to international students). Even if they're very lucky to find a job, the rigorous H1B policy (which is only 30% chance to win the H1B lottery this year) will prevent some very talented international student from working in U.S. and making contributions to the U.S. economy. I saw some extreme comments that are saying the government gives preference to the foreigners- which is totally wrong. Those international students, as the opportunity-wise, have much less and very limited opportunities if compared with the U.S. citizens. 

This OPT thing will provide the temporary working permit to allow some most talented people in the STEM field to make contributions to the United States, help with the U.S. economy, which in turn will help generate more job opportunities. Talk about the competition, the government should consider more about the overall benefits of the STEM students who can help U.S. to be more competitive internationally rather than fix the eyes on some unreasonable people's feelings.
