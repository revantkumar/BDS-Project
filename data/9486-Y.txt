I strongly support this rule. Most foreign STEM students are very talented. The training opportunities give them a chance to contribute to the economy growth of US. Because of their different cultural background, some of their contributions are very unique that native Americans cannot make. For example, foreign students often have diffent ways of thinking, which enable them to make suggestions or decisions that may enhance a company's growth. A lot of industries are very international now. Foreign students often know different cultures and speak multiple languages, which definitely benefit the US international buisiness.
