Jason Lee I strongly support the proposal for the extension.

There are several reasons:

First of all, we should make university and college students in the US, who have learned lots of advanced knowledge and mastered cutting edge skills, make some contributions to the US. 

Also, we need diversity. The US is always a nation that can include people from different countries and different race with different color. Those elites who made a great difference are not only from native citizens but also from all over the world. Such talented people as Google CEO Pichai, Microsoft VP Harry Shum, can make the US better and better.

It is because international students and talented people from other countries working in the US, the US becomes more and more powerful.
