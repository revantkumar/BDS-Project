This is a great proposal. It helps both current F-1 students, and more importantly, all business that are hiring F-1 students, as we all know a large percentage of STEM workers are foreign.

Please allow the extension from 17-month to 24-month automatic for current 17-month OPT-STEM holder, since it would reduce the overhead for both the students and USCIS. Otherwise, on Feb 13, 2016, if the rule becomes effective, there could potentially be a huge number of applications, even more so than the H1B petitions.
