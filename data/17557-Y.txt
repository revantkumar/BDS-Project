I strongly support the new 24 month STEM OPT rule.

The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.It is required 3 years OPT to train a qualified STEM worker.It provides a sufficient time window for STEM students to get after school training. 1 years practical training is way too short for training a college graduate to be a qualified engineer/scientist (compared with the 3-5 years residency period of medical school graduates).
