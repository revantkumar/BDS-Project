I do realize that this government wants to destroy the American way of life but to allow foreigners to work here creating more unemployment among citizens is beyond the pale. Apparently you want all citizens on welfare dependent on the government so they'll keep electing those who "will take care of them". It's a great idea but you'll run out of other people's money and the producers will leave and go elsewhere. Are you going to support the population with your money?

It's bad enough that we pay for their eductaion. Now we're expected to provide jobs for them instead of citizens holding jobs. This is a total disgrace.
