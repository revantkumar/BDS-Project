I strongly support the proposal.

I have lots of talented works that is working under opt. And many qualified workers are only found among these nonimmigrants. From my experience, these STEM talents are carefully selected and are replaceable treasures for US. Without STEM extension, our company will suffer a lot and be way less competent. I think same thing will also happen for other tech companies.
