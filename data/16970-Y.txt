It costs quite a lot of money for those international students to come and study in USA. One of the most valuable thing they can get is the work experience in the american companies. Without the opt extension, they only can get little experience, which will not help a lot when they come back to their own countries.

Also, some of them may build startups in USA after working for two or three years. These startups can offer a lot of jobs for other people, which can directly make contributions to the economy of USA. But without the opt extension, they may not get enough experience, which can lead to a high chance of failing when they are developing startups. Some of them even may give up the ideas of building startups. This can hurt american.So, the opt extension is very important to the future of USA.
