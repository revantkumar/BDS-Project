The new rule is definitely more beneficial for not only the foreign students but also the whole science and technology communities. 
First of all, foreign students with STEM degrees has been one of the most important group in the industry after their graduation. As a software engineer myself, I can see nearly all of the teams under the technology department has foreigners playing key role even the CTO himself was one of the F-1 students. So if the majority of new talents like these cannot continue to contribute to the technology industry because of the tight immigration policy, that will be a huge lost for the whole US society. 
Secondly, all the F1 students with STEM degree received the education that's as good as all the STEM americans. So they are as capable of contributing to science and technology area of US as all the US citizens. Also, as Universities in the US spent so much educational resource onto the F1 students. They expect the foreign students to be what they are aiming for and make the contribution that's a match to all the resources that the institution spent on the foreign students. So that the proposed policy provides a lot more space for the foreign students to actually use what they learned in University to the real industry. Likewise, the industry will also have a bigger chance to receive the benefit of all the educational effort made by the universities.
Last but not least, as a past F1 student myself. The OPT time was really a further training and testing for the capability of the new graduates. So those who left after the filter of the OPT period are the real do-ers who can make real change to whatever they are working on. With the proposed new OPT regulation. The talents who went through the OPT period will have a lot higher quality.
