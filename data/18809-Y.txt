The OPT program is not only an essential portion of STEM education, but an effective measure for the US enterprises to pick the most needed talents from a larger pool. According to the US Department of Commerce, international students contribute $27 billion in the year of 2014 to the US economy. For those who rely on the graduate assistantship to barely cover their living in US, they are either working hard helping American undergraduates with their classes and preparing them for better careers or spending day and night doing cutting-edge research and contributing to the leading position of US in science and technology. 

It is never easy for a company to find its ideal candidate. Hiring a OPT student does not always suggest a rejection of a native candidate. Not hiring may be better off than hiring a wrong candidate for the good of the company. In fact, the invisible hand of the market works most effectively when given its freedom to allocate the resource of talent. If rebuffing the cream of the crop has ever become the attitude of the government, the country will be most likely on the track of loosing the most sought after resource in this competitive international environment. Cutting the OPT period is by no means a welcome gesture to a worldwide contribution.
