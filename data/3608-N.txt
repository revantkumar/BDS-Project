A very bad program that harms citizens. Investigations have revealed that there is a mismanagement on the OPT Program and the DHS (Department of Homeland Security) doesn't keep track of what those candidates are doing and where they are working. Foreign students are being employed outside their major of study, irrelevant to what the foreign student studied in the U.S. university. DSOs were falsifying documents in order to authorize students for OPT. No proper background check is done before approving OPT. Allowing large numbers of foreign students on is hindering job opportunities for the U.S. citizens. Foreign students will compete with Americans for jobs. Employers have tax incentives for hiring them because they will not be required to make Social Security contributions for them. This effort panders to powerful business interests to circumvent mandated limits on the admission of foreign STEM workers designed to protect American workers. This will negatively impact the ability of American graduates to pursue their careers in their chosen fields. This is yet another attempt to undermine the American citizen/worker by importing mass amounts of foreign labor to satisfy powerful special interests. This initiative must not be allowed to move forward.
