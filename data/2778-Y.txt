Hanjun Xian The reason why US is the giant of the world is because it keeps drawing talents from all over the world. Given the huge culture and language advantage, if an American still can't get a job against a foreigner, it is only because he/she is not qualified for the high hiring bar. If all foreigners leave, the bar becomes much lower, meaning Apple/Google etc. will not be as good as they are now. Other immigrant-friendly countries like Canada and Australia will be happy. This hurts US economy in the long run.
