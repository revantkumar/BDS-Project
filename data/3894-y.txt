Ouya Zhang I think this OPT extension is crucial to current international student since many intelligent people wants to work more than one year. However, currently the number of approved H1B VISA is incrdiblely low which can not meet the demand. We really need this extension to legally work in America. This is a win-win situation because most OPT students are well educated which can help America to become a better country. As president Brack Obama extends F1 VISA to five years, the extension of OPT can be an good way to improve the relationship between America and many other countries. As a conclusion, the extension of OPT helps to make America, the world as better places, why not?
