I strongly oppose this comments, and in the meantime strongly support the OPT extension. I don't think whoever post this comments have any idea how hard it is for international students to get a job in America. Let me tell you my experience.

I graduated in Dec 2013 and started looking for job. Whenever the hr or recruiter knew I am not an US citizen or green card holder, 9 out of 10 would hang up the phone because no company would like to sponsor international students. I have a GPA of 4, passed CFA level 2 and FRM level 1, and worked two years in China. I submitted around 30 resumes and called 10 recruiters every day. But it still took me 6 months to get a contract job. 

Companies definitely didn't give jobs to foreigners first. We went through same process, phone interview, several rounds on site interview, and accept same wage. They just picked up those who are more qualified and fit for the position. International students already in a weak/negative situation than locals in this process, not because their ability but just because of their visa status. If in this case US citizens still think international students take their job, they are actually too coward to admit their inability.
