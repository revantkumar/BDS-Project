I totally agree with the extension policy. International students are making huge contributions to US. Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and helping the country solve unemployment issues. Most international students are extremely good at scientific and technology and critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world. Each year, h1b holders pay more than 27%, and often more than 30% of their salary to the federal, and even more to the federal and the state. Together with the tuition fee international contribute, this money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people. 
Also, I don't think this policy is harmful to US local employment rate. First of all, US citizen has advantage to find jobs because they do not need sponsor. Also, Industry is looking for a better fit for their positions. With the competition of international talents, US local students will work much harder to compete and make themselves better for these positions.
Overall, I strongly support this rule and suggest a longer extension policy.
