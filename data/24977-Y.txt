After seeing so many US citizens comments, I just want to laugh. Do you 
really think kick all foreign talents out can help you to find a job? Wake 
up! Here is the truth, without those foreign STEM students, its harder for
you to find a job. 
Do you know employers need to face more trouble to hire foreign graduates 
than hire a US citizens? They need to do more paper work, the people they 
hired may not get job visa in the future, which means they cannot work 
anymore. Business owners are not idiot, guess why they prefer to hire those 
foreign graduates? Yes, you are not idiot neither, because they cannot find 
better US citizens who are qualified to those jobs. Now you claim that, if 
only US citizens left, employers have to hire them. This time you are wrong.
Business owners never put their money under high risk, if they cannot find 
perfect person to do the job, they will stop making investment. They 
definitely dont want to earn more contracts, and then let their employee 
screw them up. They will keep their money in their pocket, or make 
investment
oversea because they can only find high quality talents over there. Thus, 
foreign talents actually boost the economy, and with better investment 
environment, US citizens are easier to find jobs. 
The people who gave negative comments here have a same theory, I cannot find
job, because there are a lot of foreigners, who is better than me, are also
on job market. If they all gone, I will be the best, and I should be able 
to find a job easily. Is it good for a country to lose a huge number of well
educated, smart, and creative talents? Everybody knows what that means to a
country. Shame on you, you put your motherland under risk only because you 
want to find a job without making extra effort to improve yourself. Why don
t you learn something, try hard work? I dont believe if you as good as 
any working foreigner, you cannot find a job!
