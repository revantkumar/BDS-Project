I strongly agree with this extension for following reasons:
1. OPT extension for STEM filed is necessary to keep US in a consistent developing economic system. Without the extension, large amount of companies will be affected and eventually slow down the economic growth rate and current employer will be laid off in couple years time. 
2. I agree with the idea that all the international students go back to their country after graduate, U.S citizens use their own paid tax to help the large amount of lower-class immigrates (keep in mind that lower-class immigrates will increase every year, since all well-educated students are go back and not interested in apply for the immigration).
