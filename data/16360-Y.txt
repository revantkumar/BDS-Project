More than 50% of advanced degree students (MS and PhD) in Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science in U.S. schools today are foreign students; this is a fact (refer to Pew Research Center report). The question becomes whether it is better for the U.S. economy to send back these advanced degree holders once they graduate, essentially forfeiting its competitive edge, or encourage them to stay, at least a few years longer, to contribute back to their respective fields through academia and industrial jobs? I believe the benefits of extending the OPT rule are obvious, maybe more so to the U.S. economy and educational system than to the OPT applicants themselves.
