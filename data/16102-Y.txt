I Strongly support the OPT extension rule.

I support to extend OPT to ensure every qualified STEM student who has 
graduated from US universities to contribute to our country. Why should we 
send those good people out?

My friend who graduated from University of California and joined our company. 
He/She did a great job. He/She helped us to start a new project his great knowledge in semiconductor area. So we got several full time 
head counts this year and hired several college graduates.

However, he/she had to stop working because he/she did not win H1-b lottery 
and ran out of OPT. It is a great/big/ loss for our department.

Please help OPT students like him/her to get a chance to contribute to our 
great country.
