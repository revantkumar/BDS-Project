I support this rule.

1. It's good for U.S. to have more great, hard-working, talented people. 

2. There will be more talented foreigner students coming to US universities. The tuition fees and taxes they pay when they work during OPT will increase.

3. Each year, the number of H1b visa issued is limited.
