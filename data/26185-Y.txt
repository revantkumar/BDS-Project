I welcome the 24 months OPT extension. As we have seen in the past, there are great contributions by non immigrants in the field of STEM research and development, whether be it in silicon valley or ivy league universities. The extension not only motivates them but also, practically, provides a platform to continue their research or development project for more justified amount of time. 
This is a step in favor of the nation(as STEM R&D solve real world problems), the organizations-small and big (as it helps them generate revenue and stand in global markets) and its non-immigrants (as it provides them a platform to develop technically and professionally in a diverse culture).
