Zhifeng He I support the extension of STEM OPT. STEM students make great contribution to the economy of the States, as all of us can see in the area of Internet, electrical, mechanical, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and physics, both in academic and industrial area, and their rights should be protected considering their contribution. Cancellation of the extension will pose a seriously negative effect on the employment of STEM students, and thus both of the economy and the STEM students' right will be harmed.
