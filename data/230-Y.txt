I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I am a student who recently graduated from nutrition science program. Most of the research projects in our area typically require more than 3 years to get results. The new extension rule provides more time and chance for foreign researchers in this area to work on their research projects and get more findings that can contribute to a deeper understanding of the human nutrition field.
