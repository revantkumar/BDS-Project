I applaud the rule and at the same time emcourage more american youth taking STEM majors to contribute the urgent need of human resource - it's almost impossible to hire a local in the fields of machine learning, business automation, information technology. There are few americans who apply those jobs and hr has has to go through cumbersome process for sponsor an international student. without those critical roles filled, the business is hard to sustain, not to say create more commercial jobs for the locals. As we complain that internationals steal our opportunities, is it the time that we look at our own education system and say that it's time we should do something. The competition becomes global and we should strengthen our muscle to face the fact, creating a wall can not protect us in the long run.
