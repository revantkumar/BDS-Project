I strongly SUPPORT Improving and Expanding Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students.

1. This will more US education more attractive. Think about the huge amount of tuition that our universities earned from them.

2. It will benefit the US high-tech research centers and companies. I am an software engineer and working with several fresh STEM international student. They are all smart, creative and efficient. Honestly, they are more hardworking than local US students. 

3. Some people argue this will take jobs from US people-that's not true at all. For those STEM international students I mentioned above, most of them want to come back to their own country to start their own business-they just want to gain some experience here. After all, OPT is just an TEMPERORAY working permit with time limit.
