Michelle Ouyang I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons. 

I am sorry to see the argument saying STEM foreigners steal citizens' job opportunities by accepting lower wages. It is nonsense. When a company hires someone who is not a permanent resident or a citizen, the company usually prepares to sponsor H1B for this person later, since no company is willing to train someone for one year and just let the trained employee leave and contribute at somewhere else. In order to apply for H1B, company MUST pay the sponsored H-1B employee the HIGHER of the "actual wage" at your workplace or the "prevailing wage" in the industry. 

Therefore, it is obvious that those who are against the proposal are just afraid that they are not good enough to stand out in this fair competition. Fair competition can bring innovation and improvement. It is terrible if we just let such fear be an excuse to turn down the proposal. It will no doubt impede the US's development in science and technology. 

The United States is an immigration country. The ancestors of current citizens also came from other countries dated back long time ago. They stayed and prospered with their skills and hard work. And this is "American Dream". And this is a national ethos that Americans are proud of. Now this proposal creates a more fair environment for the young professionals to succeed in the US. The really outstanding people can get a chance to contribute to the US. Isn't that a good thing? Isn't that the spirit of American Dream? Shouldn't that be strongly supported? 

In a word, social progress needs fair competition.
