It is time we stopped letting people come into this country. A lot of them are people that have done terrible things and
should be deported. We need the border closed period and all people here without citizenship sent back where they
came from. Obama would rather support the illegals instead of taking care of the Senior Citizens of this country. They are
raising Medicare this year on the Senior Citizens, but not giving the seniors a raise in cola. I hope when some of the people in
congress loose their jobs and that the incoming congress will take care of the seniors. Obama and congress has stole from
from the money we paid into the social security fund over the years. Also, I worked until I was 72 and my husband worked until
he was in his 80's. I think we deserve an increase in cola.

I think it is time we cleaned out some of the people in congress that are not interested in what is happening in the country
or Obama would not get away with the things he doing to our great nation the United States of American.
