We welcome this OPT extension for STEM international students. International students contribute a lot in the technology sector after they graduate from american universities. It would not be wise if we let them go after graduation without having them utilize their knowledge in the United States. 

They receive benefits and pay taxes just as other U.S. workers. Freedom and equality is in our blood. How could we discard this by treating international students as second-class people? United States is founded by immigrants and is a pot of different cultures and religions. We can not forget that.
