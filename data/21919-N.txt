The OPT program is a 'bad idea' because it deprives American workers and American students who want to work, of their rights, instead favoring foreign students. Foreign students are not supposed to stay in our country after they finish going to school here. Adding additional time onto an already 'illegal' program is just another 'slap in the face' to our indigenous workforce. Congress never authorized the OPT program and the President should not extend it, AT ALL !
