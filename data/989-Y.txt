As an recently graduated doctroal student, I am currently working in an semiconductor company where I can apply my knowledge and learning obtained from my graduate school to this fast pace industry. Having the STEM extension is crucial to continue my contribution to this industry. Also, learning new skills and experience during my sevice is also an important supply to my career and post doctroal studies.

Therefore, without the long enough to extension, it can only cause problems to companies, the industry and recent graduated master and PH.D students.
