I am a Chinese graduate student in the US and I strongly support the OPT extension because nowadays the international students have made great contribution to the US especially in IT and engineering field. The US provides one of the greatest education in the world as well as the one of the greatest working opportunities. Many international students go to those top universities and receive the best education but it would be very pitiful that one cannot perform his talent and ability in such a great platform and their talents are very likely to get compromised when they get back to their own country.
