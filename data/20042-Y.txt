One of the most important reasons that I choose to go further with my education in the U.S. is because I can still find a job and legally work here after graduation even if I'm not able to get the H1-B visa immediately. With OPT, I can build my career path in the U.S. and devote my knowledge to the relevant industry. Considering the large amount of foreign students from all over the world, the effort of each of us putting into the industry will for sure influence the economy of America somehow. It's not hard to imagine how much loss there will be if the OPT is proscribed from students like us. I like America because of its openness and inclusiveness. I hope the proposed rule on OPT can pass.
