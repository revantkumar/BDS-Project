YUZHU WANG Unless the government can find a way to actually drive out all the employees with out valid visa(to be honest, even if they can,they won't. But this is not my main point,so I'll just give one of the reasons in the next paragragh), it's better to let the students be able to extend their OPTs.
Many international students will stay in the U.S no matter legal or not. So if their opt expired and not lucky enough to get the H1B visa(you have to admit draw by lot makes it quite hard to get), they will not simply leave, because many American conpanies offer them jobs.(This is not what one wanna see, but they have to hire international students, because American engineering students are far from enough. There is an example, in the 2015 fall quarter, the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department of Northwestern University has 100-110(can't remember the precise number) newly admitted students, only about ten of them are American. So it's quite clear that IT companies have no choice but to hire international students. In other words, it's not international students steal jobs from American students, it's more like they are doing the work which American students reluctant to do.) And when they stay here illegal, that's when there comes lots of trouble. In a word, since you can't actually drive them out(with the reason I have mentioned), it would be better to let them stay here with legal identity.
