I'm a Chinese student preparing to attend college next year. If this rule is not approved, and F-1 student can only have 1 year chance to find a job, I will not go to USA, and pay SUCH BIG amount of money to ONLY have a degree, while have little chance work here. Seriously, without working opportunities, who will spend such a lot money to go to USA???? Your education institutions will ABSOLUTELY lost a lot lot lot of money from international student if this rule is not approved!
