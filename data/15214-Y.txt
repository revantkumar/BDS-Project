I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. This rule is a major factor for foreign students when they are deciding their choices of country in which they decide to pursue advance degrees in. Without this OPT extension rule, it is US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country. This rule allows most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc to attract qualified talents on a international scale. This is how these companies stay ahead of their international competitions.
