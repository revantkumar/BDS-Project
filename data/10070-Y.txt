I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for two reasons.

1. Personally, as a foreign student, I would like to work and live in the US after graduation. OPT is a important time period for me to find a job and apply for working visa.Given the competition in job market and uncertainty of getting working visa, the OPT extension would provide me a better chance of landing my dream job and live in the US.

2. From the perspective of the US, STEM students who are well-trained in science, technology, engineering and math are people who determines the future of US economy. Most people working for the most influential companies such as Apple, Google, Boeing, Exxon, Dow etc. are former STEM students, and they contribute most to the society by innovating the best products, conducting cutting-edge research and of course, paying taxes. Without STEM extension, less of those students will have a chance to find a job in US and provide for this country. In return, America will lose the future because they lost all those talents to other countries, such as China and India. 

Therefore, improving and expanding training opportunities for STEM degree students is an important act for the prosperity of United States and is something US government should support.
