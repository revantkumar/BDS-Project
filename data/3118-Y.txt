Gakkidi Karthik Reddy I SUPPORT the new regulations for F-1 students.

1. With the new STEM extension, F-1 students will be able to apply the knowledge they gained from American universities to the American industry. This is a win-win situation for both the US, as well as the students. F-1 students can apply their knowledge to industry, innovate, which will in turn contribute significantly to the US economy. This help keep the US competitive and a world leader in STEM in the future.

2. Cancelling the STEM extension program, will force many students back to their home countries with the knowledge gained from American universities. This self imposed "Brain Drain" will severely hurt USA's competency from an economic point of view as well its standing as a technology leader of the world.

3. I agree that, there has been an increase in competition due to large number of international students in STEM areas, but this a fair and constructive competition which is necessary for finding the right talent and "brains". This talent, when harnessed will only contribute to the US economy and create many more job opportunities in the future for other Americans to enjoy through technological innovation.

4. American industry has a high demand for skilled individuals in the areas of STEM research. The supply, unfortunately falls short of the demand when we look within domestic institutions. International students are necessary for filling this gap. Only the best of the international students will be selected by a rigorous and fair job interview process.

5. F-1 students are honest, hard working, tax paying and law abiding individuals. This is because of the fact that we know what is at stake if we misbehave. 

Finally, I urge you to consider the incredible number of achievements and innovations created in the STEM areas by International F-1 students, whether in American academia or in the industry. We will make America proud!!!
