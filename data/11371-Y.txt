I am a legal immigrant working in the top tech company. I was OPT student with Ph.D. degree in STEM field myself years ago, so I understand the struggle and confusion of those OPT students. 

Here I strongly support the proposal for many reasons. But the most important one is that America should profit from its smart investment: America have already picked, educated and trained them with all the resources in two to five years time for each STEM student. Why not give those students time and chances for them to work and pay back America for what America has already invested in them. They are young and driven. They can be good labor and become talents in many fields for many years. Throwing away what America has already invested in, when we can actually profit from them, is stupid. 

As for competition, let's face the truth: Shipping them back won't eliminate the competition, instead, that would just turn more people (especially the ones America has already spent time and money to educate and train) to our opponents' hand. Obviously the smart move here is to give those young and well-educated STEM students a chance to become our allies legally rather than our competitors. 

Another thing I really can't understand is that: On one hand, America now hand out permits for illegal immigrants to work. On another hand, America is considering depriving the well-educated STEM students who have come here LEGALLY of the opportunity to work and contribute to America?! Indeed, no good deed goes unpunished, right?
