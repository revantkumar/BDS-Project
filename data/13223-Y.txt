Someone keeps saying that keep International students working in US spends US taxpayers' money, which is so not true. International students also pay tax. They have the tax pay and return knowledge educated in University. And they do pay normal tax when they start to gain income. I think the only concern is that even they pay tax, there is still some citizen benefit they won't get anyway. But it's fine, I mean US has the right to keep their benefit from foreigners. But open your eyes, the students do make contribution to state and federal.
