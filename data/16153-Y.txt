Dear Chief Westerlund:

I would like to submit the following comments to support the USICE Proposed Rule, Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students, published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2015.

As an international student in the United States, I pursued (or am pursuing) a STEM degree and will graduate in 2016 with a MS degree in the field of Financial Mathematics. The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.

The rule will definitely help U.S. in various ways. First, US needs a larger technology workforce to maximize economic growth, which is essential and ensures recent fed rate hike won't do any harm to the economic recovery; and students will contribute to the growth of US Economy by innovation and research in other ways of finance, medical research, etc. Moreover, the employers rely heavily on the top notch brains and new energy filled students who can bring benefit to the company by the new developments science and technology and IT.

I suggest you to welcome the new proposals and without this the students will leave the US and there will be brain drain and students will be losing the touch on the Stem degree advancements and experience.

I was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.
