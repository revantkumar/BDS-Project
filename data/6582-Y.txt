I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for extension 24 month opt

Most of the international students are STEM major and many of us will work in the area where most of U.S. citizen are not good at. In the school, it is easily to see that most of students in the majors, such as statistics in the grad school, are international students. It is NO REASON TO CONCLUDE THAT INTERNATIONAL STUDENT WILL AFFECT US CITIZENS JOBS. Instead, international students did the job where the native are not good at. If United States don't allow opt extension, most of the STEM international student will go back their country and contribute their own country with the knowledge given by the United States. I WILL DEFINITELY BE A THREAT FOR THE FUTURE UNITED STATES TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT.
