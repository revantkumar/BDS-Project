As a rational, critical thinking tax- paying citizen, I too oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. 
This counter- productive expansion scheme would allow U.S. Tech Companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and facilitate their AVOIDING paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the tax-paying, U.S. Citizen employee's pay. 
Not only does this proposed program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. 
With recent U.S. CITIZEN college graduates (many of which are OIF/OEF veterans such as myself) struggling to find work, this is a horrible time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens, or to cater to immigrant lobbying interests over the interests of American citizens.
