I strongly SUPPORT the extension of OPT for STEM majors for 24 months. Because: 

1. STEM students is an important work force in the US science and tech industries. A large number of professionals working in this field are still on their OPT. If this ruling doesn't pass, many companies will face a sudden loss of their critical workforce. 

2. Giving a longer time of internship for STEM students is very fair because US universities spend millions to scholarship a big portion of these students until they earn their degrees (graduate students). And now we don't allow them to stay and make contributions? How dumb is this. 

3. If we want to keep jobs for the domestic work force by chasing out more educated and hardworking immigrants, it will only do bad to this country.
