STEM OPT extension is a great step forward for students who come to US and earn a degree. After completing a degree its always great if we could get some training or experience on your field of expertise. For me studying in US was my dream and I invested all the money made in 3 years in getting a US degree.

As per my experience, after graduation I had a very hard time in finding a job as most of the companies were not willing to take F1 students and I finally got a job after so much trouble. Many of my friends left the county without finding a job. At the same time all my US friends got jobs very easily and I dont think an F1 student could affect their job. If stem extension is going be cancelled, even that small light of hope for a student coming to US is going to fade. I'm pretty much sure no one will hire or recruit an F1 student if they are sure that they are going to leave them in an year. 

In the long time run only US is going to benefit from the brains they get through this program, and I recommend STEM OPT extension is a great step forward. I hope US is going to keep the policy of supporting legal immigration and should take measures against illegal immigrants.
