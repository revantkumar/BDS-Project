I STRONGLY SUPPORT the opt-extension.

Firstly, the opt-extension is one of the most important reasons why we foreign students choose United States to pursue higher educations. If the extension is canceled, people will choose not to come to the United States. Thus all the universities will lose a large amount of talented students who could have pushed the academic area much further. If the universities in US want to appeal more smart students, the opt-extension is a must.

Secondly, it is nonsense to say that foreigners are taking the American's job. STEM students who got their jobs by their own effort. They got the same degree, they went through the same process of interviews. ONLY QUALIFIED PEOPLE CAN GET JOBS. People who are complaining about having no jobs are just not qualified enough. 

Thirdly, technology is a big force that pushes forward the economy of United States. And the truth is, those big tech companies in US need these STEM people. In the future, they are going to need hire more and more talents among them. If USA wants to keep her 1st place in the technical world, she cannot lose these talents.
