I am writing today to comment on President Obama's most recent attempt to circumvent the needs of American workers in favor of foreign workers. This is an outrage and a terrible blow to those millions of American workers who desperately need work. How long will this government of liberals and bureaucrats continue to bring down and destroy
the American worker? This is a terrible idea and should not be allowed to happen.
