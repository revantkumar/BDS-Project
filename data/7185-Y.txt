I definitely support this proposal and I believe it could benefits from a lot of different reasons.

First, this policy could attract many international students to study in the US and contribute their effort in many key domains which needs huge amount of perfect talented people. From those people who make such choice I know, most of them are the very good technical students in their own country. With this policy, people like this are eager to make contribution in the related industry in us which kind of help US to keep lead in all these domains. These domains need the collaboration and we should never keep these people outside the us and we should give them an opportunity to work in the us and to contribute to our industry.

Second, I think not all the STEM students are keen on immigration or becoming an US citizen. The things they really care about is to learn the most high trend technologies and to keep our human being moving step forward. We should never doing things which stop them or keeping them away from with the not open-minded policy.

Third, someone mentioned some work force company take use of this policy to make some effort and try to change something. However, from my own experience, I have never seen an example like this, and also this should not be an excuse to ban this policy because we could do more efforts on inspecting the company like this and stop them from doing this rather than totally give up this policy. Since the benefits this policy give us is much much more compare to the bad aspect.

For the three point I share, I think we should definitely support this opt extension policy and enjoy the benefits!!!!!
