DHS' proposed rule to expand OPT gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students over Americans. I am standing up for U.S. STEM workers and American students seeking STEM careers. This proposed rule MUST not go into effect EVER. 

During 2009 - 2013 OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs. OPT also removed $4 BILLION from the trust funds of Social Security and Medicare.

DHS must not be allowed to expand OPT. This must be stopped.
