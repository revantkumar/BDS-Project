I definitely hope this new rule could get approved. I am a software developer at one of the largest company. I can see the potentials of the international students in my team, and they do contribute a lot to team's projects. Actually, our software team is composed of guys from different countries, and everyone feel comfortable working together. To some extent, my company depends on these people, and I could not estimate what a big loss it could be if they left my company because of the OPT extension problem. Besides, I know some are worrying about the difficulty for the American citizens to get hired if this new rule takes effect. It's unreal. I have participated in the hire processing for many times, I should say there is not too many american candidates, seems Americans is not very keen on software.Our team's hire bar is very high, the opt extension does not assure the job opportunity for the foreigners, we still pick up the guy we really want. 

The only thing I want to reiterate is the new rule means a lot to my team. I do not want to see the situation when we want to hire new graduates and there is few choices. The technical fields need these smart guys to keep moving on.
