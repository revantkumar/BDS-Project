Fuling Yang I highly support this rule. 

First, There are many non-immigrant students working in United State, providing lots of contributions in industry, specially high technology and science industry. Opt extension give them enough time to works for United State and continue to contributions for US.

Second, lots of works related to STEM is low-salary, only the recently graduate international students with high degree want to take it. If opt only have one year, amounts of students do not want to take amounts of works with low salary. therefore, many company could not employee such workers with high degree and thus do not get increasing profit and then will impact US economy. 

Third, Many company usually spend a few months and money to train new employee. If this international students can work up to three years, this money and time in training will more valuable.

Fourth, Most of international students get fellowship from undergraduate and graduate school, if the OPT up to three years, those international students will contribute more in the industry and thus make this fellowship more valuable for supporter in US.
