I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. I do not believe that this program is i the best interest of America and American workers. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. This program creates an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans and to potentially keep wages down. It was designed to give workers practical work experience which I fully support but there's no reason that can't be achieved in the current 12 - 29 months that the program allows, With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens. In fact, I would like to see the entire program capped at 12 months for all foreign workers. We've got to start taking care of our own.
