I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.. And the present one year working period is not enough for new graduates to have a enough amount of experience in their job. Many projects and services are being completed in the period of three or more. The right of their working period should be secured by the government.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S.. Many great minds from all over the world is the very reason that makes united states prosperous. If the government decides to stop giving opt extension to new graduates, many STEM related industries will be seriously harmed by the running off of talented graduates, and the economics will surely be affected too.

3. There are many opening on the job market, and most of them are related to STEM majors. The unemployment rate has nothing to do with the opt extension. The government should really look into the statistics of unemployment cause and come up with other method to deal with it, instead of cutting F-1 students off.
