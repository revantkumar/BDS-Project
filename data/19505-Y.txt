It is never OK to put foreign workers ahead of our fellow Americans. We have already seen the student visa program backfire on us. After the foreign students get trained they go back to their homeland and develop our technology there. Michio Kaku gave an interview and expressed exactly what I just stated. It is time to learn from our mistakes and not re-live them. An idiot is one who does the same thing over and over EXPECTING different results. Don't make the United States look like a nation of idiots.
