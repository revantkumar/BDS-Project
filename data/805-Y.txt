Vivian West I would say that STEM students absolutely need and deserve the expanding training time for their unique knowledge and skills to be fully practiced and successfully applied in the United States. Apparently nowadays it could take months to finish one's job searching and this is especially the case in industries involving engineers and scientists as the interviews usually contains several rounds before the final offer is given. Even for one already in the industry, he would need to draw for the H1B visa which is held once a year,and I see out there are numbers of cases in which the core engineers didn't get the H1B before OPT expires and subsequently has to leave the position even though the company really needs him or her. The group of STEM students are hardworking people and they maintain a good relationship with US employers for a long time. Let's make sure these people can make the best of their effort and knowledge and be a resourceful power in this country!
