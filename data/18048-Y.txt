Strongly support to the OPT extension! Reasons as following:
1. No wonder it is a big heart attach for high tech industry if OPT extension will no longer be available. International students make a great contribution to the boost of the tech industry.

2. Cancellation of OPT extension means sending back those students who got the best education in the US. We are giving out our knowledge and resources for training of those international students, letting them go back right away. This is definitely a big hurt among the global competition in the long run.

3. Those who cannot find jobs are the ones hardly qualifies the position. Even with the policy cancellation, I can hardly imagine company hiring those people. If the companies have to hire those people not capable of doing the job to accommodate the work load because of the lack of talents after abandoning the policy, all I have to say is "Good Luck."
