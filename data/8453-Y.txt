I strongly support the proposal. Firstly, the long OPT period for STEM students is one of the major reasons why STEM students choose U.S. as their destination for education. Under the policy, STEM students do not need to worry about the uncertainty of life for a few years and therefore, can focus on study, research, internship and professional improvement. The stability and focus, in turn, benefits numerous U.S. technology companies where these STEM students work for. Secondly, international students bring huge economic benefit to the school's local area, including shopping, service, housing and etc. Without the policy, the reduced-size of international students will become the loss of local economic opportunity and employment. Thirdly, the STEM talents coming from abroad contributes to America's success in this era of technology boom. They are hired because the companies need their talents. Some may say employees under OPT is underpaid. In common sense, as an internship period, it is very normal to be see a lower payment than full-time jobs. But, in fact, a lot of companies, such as Google, Microsoft, FB and Apple, are paying the same amount to STEM students during their OPT as a full-time. Therefore, it is never a problem of payment. It is a demand of talents. Many technology companies in other countries, such as China and India, actually offer very competitive packages to STEM students. If the proposal cannot pass, I would say the aggregated loss of the US technology companies would be much greater than the individual impact on students.
