As a HR of an e-verify company, I am strongly for the new rule.

There are over half million e verify companies in USA after extension from 12 month to 17 month, why ?

Because all these companies need OPT students to work here longer time due to NOT enough Americans are interested in these STEM majors and the work, we can't have enough suitable people
from only US citizen , while all these high tech companies make great success in the past few years
and bring US economy from recession to recover, we play a great role on today's economy and all these OPT students are doing the most basic job. If OPT extension stop, what we will see is that half million companies will miss half of the OPT students who didn't get HiB, as only 50% OPT students can get H1B,
we can't imagine the huge problem we would face then.
