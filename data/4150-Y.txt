Siyu Chen Why STEM students like me chose US to be the place we further our study? One of the most important reason is that US provide OPT as well as OPT Extension. One thing people have to admit is that international students create far more research achievement than US students. If OPT extension is no longer available, the academic sector of US will be the one that suffers the most severe loss and harm.
