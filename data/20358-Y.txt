Dear sir,
I'm so exciting to hear that the OPT has a new and positive reforming. I'm an international student. In order to get an advanced knowledge, I spend more than 30,000$ a year studying in U.S. The OPT will give me more opportunity to practice my knowledge, and in this way I can do some indirect contribution for U.S. That is a win-win opportunity. OPT makes U.S. to be a more competitive country than U.K. or Canada. In this way, OPT will create more job opportunity for the Americans.
