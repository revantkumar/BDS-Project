I agree with the OPT extension, which I believe is actually favoring the United States.

Most of the objections I viewed say that "OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013", which assumes that if the foreign students didn't take the position, it would be the Americans'. First of all, based on my experience, there are very few US citizens with STEM majors. If it's not the foreign students, US companies may have to spend more money to hire from overseas or even move to other countries.

On the other hand, each of the 430,000 jobs was given by the US companies, who I assume don't have any preference for foreign students. Therefore the best foreign students got the jobs in a fair competition. If US was going to build a great wall to save the positions for US citizens, it may be beneficial to US in the short run by reducing the unemployment rate a little bit, but in the long run, US will probably fall behind in the competition with other countries.

United States has a history of attracting and accepting foreign talents, which helped it become a great multi-culture country now. Great wall or isolation will not keep a country safe forever, and US knows it when it united the 13 states. I hope the spirit of US will carry on.
