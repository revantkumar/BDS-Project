This proposal makes a lot of sense and as a student currently on F1 OPT I can say its gives me the confidence to continue my pursuit of quality work at my current organization. i can also visualize how non-immigrant students like me would find it both attractive and valuable for their time in USA as well as feel respected with their legal status in the states.
