I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. U.S. employers will benefit from the increased ability to rely on the skills acquired by STEM OPT students while studying in the United States, as well as their knowledge of markets in their home countries. For example, China becomes the largest market in transport network area. There is a team called China Growth in Uber. Chinese students know the culture and people's life style in China much better, so they can contribute their skills and knowledge to US companies like Uber, and help push forward America's economy. OPT extension can give foreign students enough time to complete projects in US company because most of them need more than one year to complete.
