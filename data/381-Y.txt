Mike Hagfeldt This should not even be a proposal. How can you defend taking away 430,000 from American citizens and giving them to foreign worker for the period of 2009-2013? Not only that, this program has also taken $4,000,000,000 from social security and medicare funds. All to the benefit of FOREIGN workers. 

This program is being abused by the administration in the fact that it has administratively established a de facto shadow H1-B program, in violation of Congressional intent. 

It is time for the trampling of American citizens to stop. Let us take care of our own first. I am tired of this administration ignoring the people who put them into office in favor of foreigners. 

DO NOT IMPLEMENT THIS!
