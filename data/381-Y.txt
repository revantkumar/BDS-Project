12 months OPT and 24 months extension for STEM majors are not only good for those international students themselves, but it also plays an important role for the US's labor market and even the economy as a whole. The thing is, International students especially those who are with STEM degrees have abilities that best fit many domestic employers' needs, while there are not enough numbers of domestic students with the same abilities (i.e. with STEM degrees) to fulfill that needs. That being said, the international students do not take the domestic students' positions of finding the same jobs, and international students need to stay largely because the market needs them. If a domestic employer faces two people with different background have the same skills, she would most likely hire the domestic rather than the international one still.

Those who major in STEM suffer harder and longer time in college, with less resources and less relationships than the native students, more difficulties that different environment brings to them, to utilize their abilities to help the US to have better welfare, and to get more involved into the labor market to realize their own value during a certain amount of time. I would argue that It is not unfair for the domestic students. International students need the rights to have more choices. I support the policy of 12 months OPT for all F1s and 24 months extension for STEM.
