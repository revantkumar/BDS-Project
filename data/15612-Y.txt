I am currently enrolled as a student in a graduate program in computer science in US. I have learned a lot here. I came to US to gain enough knowledge for some years to start a software product company later on in my life. Having STEM OPT extension helps me to gain more practical experience in this area for enough amount of time.

When I was searching for jobs few months back, I found many startup companies in bay area are founded by immigrants. They came to US to pursue masters and then gained enough experience before starting a company. US needs those kind of people and I support this STEM OPT extension rule.
