The OPT extension for STEM is very helpful for F1 Student and the technology of US. First of all, It took me five years extensive training to get a Ph.D degree and one year training in industry to become a qualified engineer. I really appreciate the comprehensive training in the US as a foreigner. Secondly, I become a capable person with the increasing skills and would like to contribute the progress of my current serving company.
