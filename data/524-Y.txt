OPT is not only the chance for all international students, but also an huge improvement for all US citizens. F-1 students who can apply for OPT are at least Bachelors, if not Masters or PhDs. Better education allows them to generate more value, pay more tax, help companies growth and bring more jobs. Meanwhile, they are less likely to commit serious crimes, contributing to a safer neighborhood. 

For the minorities who are afraid of immigration problems, international student is a much better choice than other choices, including illegal immigration that could not be totally stopped.
