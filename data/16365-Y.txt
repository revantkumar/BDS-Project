I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. This proposal is important, not only for the stem students but also for the US IT companies and the whole society.

The students could contribution to the U.S. with the knowledge learned from U.S. universities. Someone may think this will leads less job opportunities for U.S. citizens, while, the society will full of energy because of this kind of competition. People's life will be better if we have a better society and better economy.
