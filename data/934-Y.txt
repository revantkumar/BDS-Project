I strongly support this rule. US government should allow international students to practice/train whatever they have learned out of US universities, especially for those who have majored in STEM fields. Because to become a better and better developed country(or even world), more and more workers contributing in these STEM fields are needed. I don't see any good reason to limit international STEM students seeking opportunities to better develop themselves as well as to support the companies that hire them. People should know the fact that some leaders of cutting edge technology companies were international students before they succeeded in their business. I'm not saying international students can do better things, but if they are given a bit more time, some can do amazing jobs and contribute to the country.
Some people say that international students are taking so many job opportunities that American people could have taken. I would say first of all, competition makes better people stand out. Also for some of the opportunities, companies were not able to find suitable native workers, thus they turned to international students.
Approving this rule does not mean that international students are destroying native people in terms of finding a job. And it does mean a lot for international STEM students who want to better improve their skills that they have studied from US universities.
