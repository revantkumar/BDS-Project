Toby James The OPT extension would give more opportunities to international students who are talented and highly educated. That is exactly what US economy need right now. While some may worry about the job being stolen from international students, there is a simple thing that needs to be clarified. Economy can only provides jobs when it is strong. Students with talent, regardless of their origin, could be a driving force for the economic growth, thus creating more jobs for the general public. Simply say internationals would steal Americans' job away is a misunderstanding of current policy and situation. US is built by talented immigrants. Think of how much growth those talented european scientists contributed during and after the World War II period. U.S could greatly utilize those international students' talent and by no means is the OPT extension going to make Americans jobless.
