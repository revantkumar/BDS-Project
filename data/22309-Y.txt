I strongly support this rule for following reasons.
1.This rule could benefit American economy a lot, since foreign students' could devote much of their talents and contribution to USA by doing researchs and working in U.S. 
2.This rule will motivate US native youths to work harder and be more competitive. 
3.I think US students who complaint about this rule should be more confident about themselves, since they do not need spend much time learning English and they are more adaptable studying and working in US due to familiar value systems. 
4.The U.S. 's spirit is providing chances to all people who want to chase their dreams. Therefore, foreign students should have more resources and platforms to pursue their lofty goals.
