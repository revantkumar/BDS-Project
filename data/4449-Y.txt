I do not agree with the new STEM laws. I am a taxpayer and have seen the economy and the standards of living suffer only to benefit the wealthy and corporations. Lawmakers need to side with Americans and our way of life if there is to be any stopping of the slide of the American way of life. I, myself, came here as a young child with my parents to pursue the American dream, legally and without any help from insidious influences. We have to stand with America and make a statement for our standard of living. There are far too many Americans without a proper job and education to continue to allow people to come here to take advantage of a system only to carry the benefits away.
