I strongly support the OPT STEM extension program. Foreign students with higher degree in STEM actually are making great contribution to the high tech industry of the US. Actually there is huge demands of high tech professionals in the business and there are not enough US personnel can meet the demands. That's why foreign students with higher degrees can find a job, because US need them. All universities spent a lot of money on the foreign students to help them to gain higher degrees, it is a pity if US loss these foreign students.
