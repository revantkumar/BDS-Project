I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1> The government should let the students who get their degree in the US learn more about their industry by working for the US. Field experience is also an important part of obtaining skills and knowledge. Not to mention while the students are working for the US companies, they are also making contributions to this country.

2> Diversity is one of the most important features of the U.S. Most celebrities who contributed for this country were international students, like Qian Xuesen, and Li Zhengdao.

3> Competition can be a win-win solution for the development of the US industry.
