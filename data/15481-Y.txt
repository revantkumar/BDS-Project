Students who can write code should have a chance to stay longer to prove their potential ability of improving the technologies and, as a side effect, boosting the economy of our country. 
If America wants to beat the eastern giant in the next 30 years, it needs more programmers than ever. All fields, including non-engineering fields are using computers to get work done more quickly, more accurately and more efficiently. Computers will be the center of all aspects of a country's strength, and determine who will lead the world 30 years later. Who can make computer work as we want, programmers, and only programmers.
As everyone know, most American students are not a fan of doing programming and can do nothing to help America to compete with the emerging country in Asia. Every programmer we send back to his/her own country, we lose a piece of strength in the future competition, and lower our chance of continuing our leadership and rule maker of the world.
They, Asian programmers, want little. They are satisfied as long as they have a computer to type code and a place to sleep. You can't find anyone who wants less but contributes more. They are the real resources the country needs: not the lawyers, not the businessman, but the programmers, Asian programmers.
In my view, giving them green card directly should be put on schedule. We should not waste time here arguing about OPT. In the near future, some thing big might happen and we need strength of programmers to win the country victory.
