I strongly support OPT extension for STEM F-1 visa holders.

First, those who seek OPT are by definition:
1) competitively selected across the globe by US education institutions, they are no doubt among the most intelligently-capable not only in the US but across the world;
2) finished higher education, mostly post-graduate degrees in the US, which again proves their potential ability to contribute to local and global economy;
3) highly-motivated to apply what they learn to various parts of US economy.
Letting more of these people work in the US will only bring boosts to US economy, especially the most critically growing sectors, like information technology, biomedicine, engineering, etc.

Second, this population chose to study in the US at the first place, because of the openness and diversity of the US. They chose it because they know US is a land where actual contributions to the people and society is appreciated regardless of nationality or race. Needless to say, it is the exact reason why the United States is leading the world today.

Thirdly, the majority of the OPT seekers are not planning to stay in the US permanently. They only need the opportunity to get solid training in the industries to gain valuable experience they cannot get outside the US.
