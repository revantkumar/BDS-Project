This is sickening how government officials and corporations are selling out this country to other country's and supporting their economies. This bold act is called traitorous to their own. What kind of leader deliberately sells out their country other than to line their own pockets with greed. However, where do these people belong according to our constitution. PRISON. That wonderful privatized pipeline to prison that they helped to create. It is high time for corruption to END. It is time to take back our once great country from the tyrants at hand. It is old and sickening what these extremists have done for themselves but no one else. It is government by the people, for the people. Not government for the leaders to corruptly take bribery/lobbying money to line their pockets with greed. I hope Bernie Sanders wins and puts this practice in its grave and the people who helped create it in prison where they belong. Do you have a GODLY conscience?
