I strongly support the proposal of improving and expanding OPT for students with STEM degrees for the following reasons:

First, international students have historically made significant contributions to the United States, both through the payment of tuition and other expenditures in the U.S. economy. Since we pay higher tuition, the institutes have more funds to improve their facilities and provide more professional services to ALL the students. As international students, we are legally TAX PAYERS and very discipline. During the time we live in US, the living cost mainly goes to the US CITIZENS. For example, in the 2013-2014 academic year, international students and their families at colleges and universities across the U.S. contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy and supported 340,000 jobs.

Whats more, the U.S. academic sector can remain competitive globally compared with Canada, UK and other country if it has longer OPT. For example, As a recently enrolled STEM student, when I applied for graduate school, I also had offers from UK and HK apart from US. I finally came to US because there is a longer OPT period which can help me develop my career skills in actual industries. I think in the extension period I could have enough time to gain practical experience in the industry. One-year experience is not convincing enough for students whod like to come back to their homeland, and this will deduce the attraction of U.S. academic industry.

Finally, please stop complaining about the Extension squeezing locals out of the job market! Employers are NOT charity, they have no obligation to provide jobs to those who are not capable to the position but are only citizens! If you want a job, READ your textbooks and WORK as half diligently as the international students.

Therefore, I strongly support this new policy.
