Given that 12 million US citizens are unemployed/underemployed, that youth unemployment is very high, that the labor participation rate is at its lowest level since the 1970's, that companies such as Disney, GE and Google use the H-1B visa program to force Americans holding jobs to train their foreign replacements and 50% of US STEM graduates can not find jobs in their fields, now is NOT the time to expand the importation of foreign nationals who do not pay the taxes we pay and can repatriate their income to their home country with little or no US taxation. Put this program where it belongs - in the recycle bin.
