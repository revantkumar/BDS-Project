I think this proposed rule for improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant students with STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for all Eligible F-1 Students is absolutely correct. There are such great demands of students with STEM Degree in the job market and those students help bloomberg economy of United States. United States spends a large amount of money and efforts to educate those foreign students in STEM area and provide financial supports for their research. If they are not able to work for US after completing their degree, this is going to be a big loss for US economy and scientific research. Also, United States is a great country with diversity. Giving opportunities for nonimmigrant students to serve the country using their high education will motive more students come to United States to pursue their advanced degrees. 

To sum up, I would support getting this rule approved and I'm willing to provide additional comments as needed.
