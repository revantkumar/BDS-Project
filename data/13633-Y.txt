I strongly support this rule. First, for comments that shout about "foreigners robbing jobs", please be advised that this rule only applies to students in the STEM fields. There is no sign that Americans are losing jobs in the STEM fields. In fact, high techs (like Facebook and Google) are actively recruiting Americans but the American graduates just cannot fill the gap. This is the only reason why we need foreign students. I don't see any reason that banning this rule would lead to an increase of hiring rate, unless more of our own students decide to join the STEM fields. Second, we certainly want to keep these students who have been trained and educated for years to first contribute to our community. Sending them back immediately is the most dumb decision ever -- you trained elites and send them to work for you opponents.
