This new policy will definitely benefit the United States and large majority of it's people, economically and socially. Foreign students greatly complement the lack of talent in STEM fields in the United States. Thus, the country will become stronger when competing with other countries in technology, which is the key competition globally nowadays.This policy will also help the students to stay in United States. The highly educated students will be a big plus for the overall society. I am glad that the Obama administration has taken serious steps towards attracting international talent. This is a big step.
