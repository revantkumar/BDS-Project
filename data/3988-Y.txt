Hao Chen The current immigration law is already very harsh to the high-tech international students, which tends to push these talents back to their own countries after they receive systematic high tech training. In addition, the chance of getting h1b is becoming lower and lower every year. Look at those big companies like Microsoft, Google, Facebook and so on, how much value do these international students already create and how hard are they working? The current immigration law is very non-attractive to international talents comparing to other countries. With the low chance of getting the h1b, most talents will have to go leave the US if the opt extension is not granted. I don't know why people treat the international talents as their threat in the job market. The total H1B slots are only 85000. The number of stem students is not like millions. It's acctually very few. Being so stingy is not good for the US. Please don't be so short viewing. We should look at the future. The value created by international talents will help a better US economy, which will creat more job opportunities for everyone. Actually the international talents are not a threat at all since the number is small comparing to other low-paid jobs
