As a F1-OPT student, I feel it really helpful for us to have the 24months extension. Because it is already so hard for us international students to find a job in the US since the language and some job limitation, actually we need much longer time to find a job than citizens(that's reasonable), I mean, the international students who are on F1-OPT can find a job, that means they are excellent enough, so it was good to extend their time limitation for the job. It was also good for the company and the US!
Also I want to mention is some international students, like me, want to have a job after graduation in the U.S, then go back to our home contry after about 2 years, if we can get the extension for 24 months, that maens that we don't even need to comete for the limited H-1B visa!
