First of all, international students are not taking job opportunities from domestic students. US economics has been growing since the financial crisis in 2009, and there is a large demand in workplace especially in the STEM field. Non-immigrant workers are contributing to the US economics growth, while at the same time achieving their individual goals. 
Also, non-immigrant students who are hired are usually well-rounded efficient workers with impressive achievement both on and off campus. They have to work harder than most of American students in order to stand out in the job market to persuade their employer to hire a non-native speakers among a crowd of competitive domestic students. 
Non-immigrate students earn no premium compensation from the workplace, but they need to yield better performance because once they are laid off, they have no back-up plan but going back to their countries. Besides workplace, non immigrant students are making the whole society better. With good educational backgrounds, immigrant students contribute little to none crimes. Also, please pay attention to a considerable amount of tax they pay, and sales they generate. They are paying tax, but little of them are eligible to enjoy domestic benefits such as lower in-state tuition and free elementary education for their children.
I just heard many of said stories that managers need to say goodbye to his/her well-performed non-immigrant workers because they are not selected from the H1B lottery and their OPT expires. The workplace need them, and they just need more time and opportunity.
