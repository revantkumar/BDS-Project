The diversity and tolerance deeply rooted in American culture have been attracting the most brilliant and diligent people around world to this country. These immigrants have made great contributions to the US economy and they will continue to strength the US's competitivity. 

We simply look around: the Instagram that young people are using, it's got a co-founder from Brazil; nobody will enjoy the convenience brought by Siri, without the entrepreneur Dag Kittlaus who originally was a Norwegian; two of the three founders of YouTube were born outside of the United States. Without their contribution, how are we supposed to keep America as the most creative and powerful country in the world?

Please take a moment to think before you decide what you are holding towards this regulation. Forcing them all to leave the US is not the solution. By contrary, we need to do more to attract creative and brilliant immigrants to the US. The immigration system is broken, we need to get it fixed. This might be a good start.
