Bilin Sun I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:
1. The U.S. benefits a lot from its immigration-friendly culture. Providing longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in U.S. Students from around the world contribute to the scientific and technical research of both educational institutions and enterprises. They also bring international perspectives to U.S. which broadens people's horizons. 
2. International students are charged higher tuition fee. International students receive the majority of their funds from sources outside of the U.S. They contributed over 27 billion dollars to the U.S. economy in 2013/14. It is good for U.S. to have talented international students to work in industry to strengthen U.S. economy.
3. International students come to study in U.S. and work hard on their course work. They deserve the opportunity of having more time to practice the skills after graduation.
