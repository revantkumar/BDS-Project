With 95 million Americans out of work, what is the point in giving our high tech jobs to foreign H1-B workers, who don't even have to pay into social security? Is your goal to simply destroy America? This is the most obnoxiously corrupt rule I can imagine. 
Your purpose should be to protect American workers, not shove them to the side. Disney already fired all their American high tech workers and forced them to train their replacements. This insanity has to stop. Don't turn the U.S. into a globalized, third world wage hell. Do what's right for the country and don't cater to the demands of this utterly evil president'.

Expecting your attention,
