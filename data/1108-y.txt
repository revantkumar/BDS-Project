Pinaki Ghosh I personal international student have a 30 Lakhs loan in India taken for my Masters and my father has job left for 6 months and my Sister just started her MBBS and still has to go 6 years.. I am serving a US company with my gained knowledge. 

Stem Extension is really required in my case. We are spending so much money keeping our homes back in India in mortgage to take bank loan for Masters and at the end serving this country with our knowledge leaving apart from friends and family. I think this country should support us for the money and strength we have spent to serve this nation.
