Once an American asked me where are you from? I said I am from China and now pursuing PhD degree here in the United States. He said, well America is built by immigrants, so keep on going. I was touched by those words and I can still recall them every time I encounter something like this. 
Those people who are in the field of STEM, who needs some time to gain experience are good students, hard workers. They are not trying to steal jobs from native Americans, because the rules have been already made to employ Americans first then international students. Now people are trying to take away opt extension? Then why allow students from other countries to study here in the first place? 
We should abandon the idea that in order for Americans to win, others have to loose. Why can we stand together and built the greatest nation in the world together? 

America values equal opportunity, i believe Americans will make the right decision.
