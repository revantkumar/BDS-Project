I believe the extension will strengthen the power of US science and technology and boost US economy in the long run. 
The STEM OPT extension helps the foreigners with higher education background and top-level talents better serve US industry, academia and economy. 
They deserve it. Those guys contribute a lot to US industrial, educational and economical interest.
