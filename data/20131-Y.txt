I am concerned that this proposed rule will give the STEM students more opportunity to fill the jobs that otherwise would go to U.S. citizens. The unemployment rate of the U.S. tech workers will continued to go up with this kind of regulation. The proposed changes would also help ensure that the nation's colleges and universities remain globally competitive in attracting international STEM students to study and lawfully remain in the United States. Why is this important? It will tend to drive up the costs of college for our citizens. We DO NOT NEED to help international STEM students succeed.
