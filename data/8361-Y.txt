I am very thankful for the new rule proposed by Homeland Security Department, which protects the basic rights of STEM students. I are so delightful to hear about that the OPT extension for STEM students can be elongated to 24 months. However, some different sounds arise recently. From my point of view, I definitely object to those sounds that try to kill this new rule.
First of all, I really worry about the future of American education institution. For me, I am an international student, majoring in Electrical Engineering. Actually, I received the university offer in France before I went to US. However, I chose US. Why? The policy that US attracts me most is the OPT extension for STEM students. In this program, our students can get more trainings and learn more skills after we finish our study in school. After that, our students can perform better in our future career development in our own country. If the OPT extension is cancelled, US education will not be so charming as before. US education institutions will lose a large amount of international students. 
Since I knew the OPT extension policy before, I chose US to finish my study. Now, the extension may be cancelled and I feel that I am fooled. Lives for international students are not easy and its unfair for US government to put so much pressure on the shoulder of international students. If the STEM OPT extension is cancelled, how US government expects that elites will come here.
Besides, some people said that international students are more competitive considering salaries, so many US citizens cannot find a job. This is definitely incorrect. The international students will do internship during their OPT extension. The salary is lower for internship than for full-time job.
