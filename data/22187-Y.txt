I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the new 24 month-extension of STEM OPT. Reasons are worthy of mentioning: 

1.Competition is everywhere, fair employment opportunities between international students and local students make a higher employment quality. Besides, international student in the US do not effect traditional industrial job opportunity. 

2.STEM immigrants have to rent a apartment and purchase goods every month. For example, my landlord is local and I pay him over one thousand dollars per month for rent. I also spend more than one thousand on food, internet, TV, phone, gasoline, travelling and insurances per month. All those moneys are paid directly to the US industries, businesses, and individuals, which definitely have a lot direct positive impact on the US government and economy.
