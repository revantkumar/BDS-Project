Has everybody in the beltline gone nuts. It seems we are trying real hard to take our jobs from our own workers and students and give them to anybody that comes along. I sure hope the american people wake up to what is going on in Washington D.C. and get new made for America blood in position to save our jobs and young people and our jobs. Lord with 18 million people looking for work the last thing we need is more foreign workers and students to take our jobs and then pay them on top of everything else. if we have that much money lets give it to our senior citizens that built this country and people from the good old U.S.A. that need it. 
We don't need more foriegn people !!!!!!!!!

P.S. I thought the Dept. of Homeland Security was to keep the U.S.A secure not to get involved in immigration things!!
