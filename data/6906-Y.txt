Some claimed that immigrants take away Americans' jobs or are even threats to Americans, as if immigrants are not paying taxes. Joke. Skilled immigrants with reasonable income submit a good portion of their income every year to the IRS, which sums up a good portion of the annual federal income. And FYI, there is no "immigrant tax law", which means there is no exemption to immigrants regarding taxation. 

Back to this proposed rule, it is about OPT, whose target is F-1 students, who are non-immigrants. Therefore it is extremely unfair to even relate this topic to all other immigrant issues this country is facing. OPT, although it is part of the US regulations, should be considered an integrated piece of the US higher education. It enables F-1 students to practice their skills in a practical scope, which may otherwise not be possible in schools. No matter how prestige a US college or university is, it cannot cultivate its students with pure theories. A best way is to encourage its students to hone their skills at US companies, while contributing to the growth of those companies in the meantime. Therefore a better chance for F-1 students learning from practice in US companies means a higher quality of the US higher education.

Despite all the above, a great country is not afraid of competitions, nor is her citizens. Instead, a great country welcomes competitions and despise sluggishness (recall what happened to a few European countries with sluggish economy). As in every sport, competition makes one stronger.
