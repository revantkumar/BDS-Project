Within the people who swarm into America every year, only a small part of them are intelligent, well-educated talents who are improving our cities, civilizing our society.
If the expanding of OPT is shut down, those talents will be forced to leave and their opportunities be shifted to the opposite group who I guess we have enough in this country.
Therefore I totally support the expanding and believe it would benefit our society.
