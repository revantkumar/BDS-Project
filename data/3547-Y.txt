I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. I believe this increased period of practical training is important for students to fully develop their skills.
Finding employment opportunities is still difficult because employers often ask the students "do you need sponsorship in future". When the response is "yes" then that's the end of the interview because sponsoring a student is an expensive long process. Most employers do not want to do that. This happened to my son. He got the job offer and refused because the employer did not do sponsorship.
