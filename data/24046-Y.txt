I support this extension because both US companies and international students would benefit from it. The international students could have the job training during the time working here, which helps them being more competitive after going back to their own countries. At the mean time, they would make contributions to United States and pay tax, booming the economic development. Furthermore, it would be easier for the American companies to find appropriate staff for some certain positions which need professional skills, or they could only outsource their business to companies outside of US, because they will always find the most saving way instead of hiring local staff with much higher salaries for the same work.
