Yongqiu Chen I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1) American science and technology industry largely depends on the STEM students.

2) If the proposal is declined, US will loss the attraction to large amount of STEM students. Lots of them will choose to make contributions to their own country instead of USA after graduation.

3) If that is the case, computer, financial, chemical, biological and medical industry as well as all kinds of research area will be faced with HUGE damage.
