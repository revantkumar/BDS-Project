I am commenting in strong support to this proposed rule.

1) Many universities and institutions spend an average of $75,000/y * 5~6 ys = $400,000 to raise a PhD student. Those large amount of money may come from various sources, but mostly, I believe, comes from US's tax payers ultimately (such as NIH funds). To train a PhD student in advanced science and technology fields is even more costly, thinking about experiments in life sciences or engineering fields. The computational facilities I am using now cost millions of dollars to build. After arming those PhDs with advanced knowledge and techniques, US government would like to send them back to their countries "generously" and let them make contributions to their own countries because the US government hasn't proposed a feasible way to keep them here. Is this too awkward?

2) Many undergrad and master programs in universities usually get a lot of international students. They pay high tuitions for completing their bachelors and masters degree. The tuitions gained by those master programs will help the universities with their own funds. If the future students know they are not able to work in US after graduation, they won't enroll in those programs. Doesn't this affect incomes of those universities and local hires?

3) International students who are working in US after their graduation contributes very much to US's advanced science and tech fields. Researches they did and products they made keep US a leader in the world. 

4) Those protestors to this new rule are majorly scared about competitions and they are essentially cowards. The right way to keep their jobs is to be outstanding in their positions but not saying "Hey, we are already Americans and we are not going to compete with you, so go away!" Americans are proud to be Americans because they are creative and willing to be advanced and the leader of the world, but not because they are just Americans.
