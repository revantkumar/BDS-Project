I think this policy will be beneficial for both U.S. government and international students. Work experience is very important, especially in science and technology fields. One year is barely enough to turn stem students into real engineers or analysts. Won't it be a great loss for the U.S. to drive those people away when they have just learned enough technical skills to really contribute to the American economy and industry?
