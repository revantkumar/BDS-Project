Guang Yang I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the international students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.

2. The excellent international students have made much contributions to the US, I think in the future it keeps going on. And I don't think they will occupy the jobs of native people, most of them work for the specified area.
