I strongly SUPPORT the proposal of improving the OPF program for the following reasons:

1.An extended period of OPT program allows F-1 students to make contributions to the U.S.. Thanks to the competitive higher education system in the U.S., these students must demonstrate competitiveness before joining the OPT program. As a result, they are qualified for opportunities and should be able to make real contributions during their time as an intern (in the OPT program). Furthermore, after learning so much from this great country, these F-1 students should be given a chance to pay back.

2.More valuable results are possible over an extended period of OPT program. Most research projects that make a great impact on the society last TWO to THREE years. During this period of time, an F-1 student participating in the project can become a true expert of the field of research. Without an extended period of OPT program, these research projects may not be able to continue smoothly. This disruptive continuation causes a loss that is unnecessary.

3.In an internationalized business environment, the involvement of international students only brings benefits to U.S. economy. The F-1 students have knowledge of both the U.S. and the country they come from. During the extended OPT program, these interns are able to apply their knowledge to help develop new products that eventually benefit U.S. economy.
