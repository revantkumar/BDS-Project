Editor's Note:

In the Silicon Valley, a new form of travel service has become extremely popular among Chinese tourists in recent time, that is, get a passing glimpse of tech giants like Facebook, Apple and Google. Most service providers of this sort are in fact employees of these companies. And therefore, Chummy, a shared-economy platform that links Chinese travelers with local Chinese expats in the US, seized the opportunity and launch such service section on its platform. Unfortunately, it evoked a great crisis for not only Chummy itself, but also a group of Facebook's Chinese engineers that had provided such services to the tourists.
