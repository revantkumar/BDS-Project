I think this will be a very good policy which will boost the US job market with more available labor source. Since the admission to the US universities is generally strict and reliable, the F-1 visa holders, who will be the potential candidates for the high-quality workers, have been proved to be able to adjust themselves to the local culture and contribute to the development of economy. At present, every country is trying the best to attract highly educated workers thus I do not think US should miss such a good opportunity. This proposal will bring convenience to the STEM students in US, as well as lead to booming economic situation, which is a Win-Win option.
