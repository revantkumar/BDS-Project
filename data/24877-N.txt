There is very high unemployment in the US and many true American citizens cannot find good paying jobs or a job at all. Many veterans are homeless and unemployed as well. We must take care of all of our citizens first and to extend this benefit to illegal immigrants is not in our county's best interest. I ask that this plan be rejected!
