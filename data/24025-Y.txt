I support this article for the following reasons:
1. United States benefits from nonimmigrant students because their work in the US would eventually contribute to the welfare of Americans.
2. Engineering and scientific community should always be open to eligible students regardless of their nationalities for the development of the whole human race.
3. Free market is one of America's treasured values. A free market should not only welcome foreign products but also foreign human resource.
4. Nonimmigrant students will not steal Americans' jobs. Because most of them are working in areas where require specialities, and they are faced with more difficulties than US citizens. If a US citizen couldn't find a job, he/she probably shouldn't blame on international students. 
5. Actually international students would create more jobs for Americans because they develop the economy.
