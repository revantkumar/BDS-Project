This is a very important proposal for both STEM students and US economy.

First of all, STEM students are well educated students who are majoring in the areas that industries are in short of talents. The companies are trying their best to attract the students to join so they can continuously keep creativity and energy to boost the performance, which also boosts US economy in the end.

Secondly, universities have invested a lot of resource on the STEM students. After their graduation, it usually take a year or so for the students to get industry experience and become really productive. Asking the students in their most productive years makes all the previous investments in vain.

Thirdly, if students are difficult to stay in the US after graduation, where they gained their professional/academic skills, the students will be less willing to come to U.S and this means U.S will be less attractive to the talents all over the world and harm the growth of the county in long term.

Therefore, I think it is necessary to extend the OPT for STEM students.
