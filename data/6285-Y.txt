I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I'm particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months.
I am glad my international colleagues are able to gain practical training experience in the US because of the OPT program and able to contribute alot in the American Economy.
OPT and OPT extension is important to be because it adds alot of strength to my career by giving me a chance to improve my skillset and grow exponentially over the years in terms of practical knowledge.
I request you to take this process furher ahead with a positive note and complete the rule making before the deadline in order to help alot of existing students who are currently working in various companies and contributing their part directly or indirectly in the american economy growth.
