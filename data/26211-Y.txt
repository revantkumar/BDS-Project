As shown in in the previous years, the international graduates have made huge contributions in the industry and academia, thanks to OPT. With these contributions comes more jobs and opportunities. It is my firm belief that the skilled students need to be given the time and benefit of the superior technology in America to help build the foundation for a strong economy. With a 24 month extension on the OPT, these workforce could contribute greatly to the science and technology both in the industry and academia.
