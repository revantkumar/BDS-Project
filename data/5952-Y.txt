Xiaoguang Dong I am a PhD student in Mechanical Engineering in Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA. As an international student, even with a PhD degree, it is difficult to find a job immediately especially for Mechanical Engineering. This is because most of the jobs in Mechanical Engineering in the US have a requirement of US citizenship. Usually it takes more than 1 year to find a full-time job with probably an internship first as far as I know in my school. Even though some people got a full-time job after several months, some of the companies simply don't support H1B application so people have to re-apply jobs at the same time so it takes more time to finally be admitted into a company who would like to support H1B. Assuming one lucky student got into a company supporting H1B soon after graduation, usually with 12 month OPT, only one lottery can be made which means the student probably still won't get a H1B.

Apparently with longer extensions of OPT, the possibility of getting a job and H1B support increases. I believe many excellent students in Mechanical Engineering want to find a job in the US because they believe that they can make a good contribution to the area. However, if without OPT extension, many people would have to leave at some point because of the status issue.

Personally, I would like to find a job in the US after graduation because what I learnt in the Graduate School could be further sharped in the industry of US which I believe is also what the US want: high educated international students work for the country. With only 12 months OPT, I think it is very difficult for me to get a H1B lottery which greatly reduce the possibility of finding a job here. 

In summary, I would support the extension of OPT for STEM students to be longer. I support the new proposal for extension of OPT for STEM students.
