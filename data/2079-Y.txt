Apparently such extension is necessary to boost US economy.

A lot of funded projects usually run for about 3 to 4 years and my company has been involved in some of those. Many international students participating the projects face issues such as visa or status, whatever it is, have to terminate their work and leave the projects. This really places a lot of burden to the projects and the company since it is really hard to find an US individual with the same level of detailed knowledge about the projects. And for many times we have to extend the expected completion date and this results in some shitty cost. 

A 24-month extension is definitely necessary and needed!!
