I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. Lots of IT companies employ large number of international students and make tons of profits. The government shouldn't stop that.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S, many people who have achieved huge success were international students here before.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. International students help companies to fill some positions which American students don't want to take. Thus, the competition is not so serious that would threaten American students. Actually, competition might help the U.S. achieve better progress by making others work harder. When there is no competition, there is no motivation.
