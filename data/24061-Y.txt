I believe this proposal is quite necessary. Only those excellent students who are intelligent and hard-working could find jobs in the US, and most of them are making contributions as engineers. For the development of the US, we still need a great deal of engineers. So, why should we set those well-trained students home while let our companies go bankrupt for staff shortage???
