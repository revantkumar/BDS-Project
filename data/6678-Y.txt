Xianda Rui I think the improvement and expansion is extremely necessary!!! Since right now it is increasingly difficult to get an H1B visa, extending the OPT time offers F-1 students more time to apply. In this case, people and their employers do not need to worry that they cannot stay even if they get a job. Therefore I strongly agree that the OPT for F-1 students should be improved and expanded.
