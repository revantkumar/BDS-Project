I think it is a ridiculous idea to offer training to foreign students so they can displace American workers. Who comes up with this kind of idiocy? I suspect this is directly from Obama to help extend the stay of foreigners to provide SOMEONE who supports his anti American schemes. DO NOT DO THIS!!! We need more schooling and training for Americans, not foreign students!!
