I am supporting to expand OPT for F-1 STEM students. I am a software Engineer at Google and I live in San Francisco area. I have heard several cases inside my company like one engineer have to live US to join another site in Sydney or in Europe because they failed to get the H-1 status in the short period of OPT time. I also heard several such cases in other companies. 

It's a situation nobody like to see: the company suffers the decrease of the working efficiency, the employee must deal with long distance communication. And America lose one US working labor to another country, along with all the spending and taxing. Besides, no American job is created!

Limit the STEM students training opportunities does harm the US economy. As far as I can see, most hi-tech companies, which are one of the most important economic engines in US, rely heavily on hiring foreign employees to keep their business growing. Without enough supply of good STEM students, those companies would either move that part of business abroad or increase salary to compete on the market, which will undermine the ability to compete in the global market.

Limit the STEM students training opportunities will make coming to US to study not promising for the prospective students, which will lead to a decrease of students willing to come to study in US. In the short term, it will harm the many US universities which are increasingly depending on foreign tuitions. While in the long run, US lose many smart brains and their offspring.

We should let the market to allocate the foreign students rather than manually creating barriers for them. It does impact on the America's economy and education.
