Im a US citizen, and Im working in a research facility in a university ranked top 30, and I strongly support this new STEM extension. Just image how many international students are contributing to the research and industry in this country! If we dont give the international students opportunities to help building a better United States, our country could not have so many achievements. We need to keep the smart and excellent researchers from all over the world to make a better America. How ridiculous if you think you can do it all on your own. We are NOT North Korea!!! Only the American who could not contribute to the country would like to keep the foreigners away. Because they are selfish, you dont care about their country, they are only afraid that they could not do such a good job compare to the other people. What are you afraid of if they could make your life better? Can you use such a good cellphone without any contribution from international researchers? You cannot!!! Wake up, you coward!!!
