I strong support the rule.Following are the reasons.
US needs a larger tech-savvy workforce to maximize economic growth
400,000 stem students from 200,000 by 2015 (Doubling of STEM graduates)
At rate of $200000.00 per student for 2 year degree with tuition and graduation fees, staying expenses and other education revenue the US is receiving ( Total $80000000000.00) will go other countries with OPT system.
US Universities and colleges will be badly affected if the OPT Stem extension is not retained and expanded to 24 months.
Most of the US Universities and colleges will shutting their doors if the OPT extension is not given, because student will choose other countries for higher education
