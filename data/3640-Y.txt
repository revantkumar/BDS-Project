I'm a student pursuing a STEM degree in the US. Extending OPT by an additional 24 months would really help in my education. The work experience obtained in the industry would add significant value to my technical expertise. Solving practical issues in the real world would put all the things learnt in the university environment in perspective, as students don't get sufficient time during classes to work on real problems and solve them to a level of completion that is adequate in the professional environment. I expect this proposal to benefit most or all international students pursuing STEM degrees in the US. Please pass this proposal.
