I strongly support extending the OPT for STEM students to 24 months. The United States is an immigrant country and we need new blood and good brains from overseas to contribute their knowledge and talents. International students who majored in STEM are the top best students around the world and they came to the U.S with skills and talents that are beneficial to America economy. They are not taking jobs away, and in the contrary, their staying helps fill the job shortages in STEM areas. I am a public school teacher and used to teach in a STEM elementary school, which emphasizemath, science, engineering and technology. However, I see the fear and uncertainty among the teachers when they approach easy math problems and math teaching. That's not where American education should be heading - fear of math and science! We need people like Salman Khan, the founder of Khan Academy, who brought revolutionary changes to the teaching of math and made math teaching and learning so much easier and more interesting. Khan's parents are immigrants from India and Bangladesh, which is the origin of Khan's math problem solving strategies. 

Allowing STEM students a 24 months OPT extension gives the best international students more opportunity to work and contribute to America. They will be the good citizens who pay taxes and add beneficial diversity to this country. Therefore, I am strongly supportive of the 24 months extension.
