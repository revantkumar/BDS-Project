I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. 
This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of
payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies 
to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their
F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the
time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.
I think it is a shame that foreigners are being treated with special privileges over and above the rights of American Citizens. It 
isn't any wonder why our country is down in quality of education below other countries of the world. Our youth is wondering what
trying to excel will do for them, when foreigners and illegals are given preference over real Americans when it really counts.
