The OPT is a critical period that allows the foreign STEM student to get the working experience and get the time to apply H1B working visa. As the H1B visa quota is become very limited compared to the large amount of applicants. The STEM foreign students may not have the chance to get an H1B visa before their normal 12 month OPT get expired. In ceasing OPT period to 24 months will give them more chances to get H1B visa. This is the first step for all of those students for their immigration and eventually realize their American Dream. America needs those high skilled, high education-ed foreign students to increase American's technology competitive advantages. Please highly consider to extend the OPT period to 24 months.
