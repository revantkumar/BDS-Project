Jingjing Yang I am an international student got my master degree in computer science this year. Many international students attracted by the dynamic silicon valley just like me. 

In the times of knowledge-based economy, the technology has no national boundary. International students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.

I strongly commend for this 24 months rule. It would urge a clear path to of absorbing and benefiting from International graduates.
