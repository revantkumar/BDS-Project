I personally support the proposal. Generally it does more good than bad to American society, by generating value in an economical way. Keep talent while saving cost boost US company's competitiveness and let US continues to be the leader of the world. Letting all the benefit of this program going home will significantly damage US's success because it builds upon talents benefit from this proposal. American workers trying to avoid competition by refusing the change comes with this proposal will let US end up using less talented workers with much higher cost, and making themselves incompetence of competing in a global scale. Plus US is an immigration country and immigrants are the back bone of this nation. So voices that preventing US from absorbing talented immigrants are against US's fundamental spirit.
