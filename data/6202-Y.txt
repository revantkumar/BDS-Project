Adam Oliver This rule will benefit the business starters like me.

I'm currently doing a start-up here at Columbia University, it's hard looking for partners since the IT industry is always hiring talented engineers and it's really hard for the unknown start-ups to get the right person. Hard as it is, I'm now able to get some of my buds in CS department to work together and we are trying to start a business here. A lot of non-tech guy like me need their help to start something.

I see that some guy are having the concern that they are going to take the job from us. But the thing is that, there is always not enough engineers here in the States, you can always get a chance if you want to be in the industry.
