I am an international student currently enrolled in a PHD program. I personally benefitted from the OPT from when I finished my college degree 5 years ago. I was able to apply the knowledge I learned in the classroom in real world. I practice using simulation software that I barely used in school. 

Moreover, the training program simulated my interests in engineering and made me realize that I want to learn more about chemical engineering. So I went back to school and enrolled in a PHD program. If I did not have the chance to participate in the OPT program, I would have not be where I am right now. 

Now that I will graduate with my PHD soon, I do hope I will get the same opportunity when I graduate. A training program when students graduate really complement our classroom education.

I support the proposed rule! Please pass the rule!
