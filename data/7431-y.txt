Richard Schmitt Dear DHS,

My comment is in opposition to this OPT program extension.

1) It is an end run around the H-1B visa program - it never should have been allowed.

2) The ability to exempt the wages from payroll taxes is a huge loophole not intended nor desired by any long term, America first thinking. It siphons funds from the Social Security trust funds needlessly and recklessly. The exemption automatically places the native worker at a disadvantage.

3) STEM fields do not customarily have training opportunities - that part is a sham.

4) It even fails to require employers to pay the prevailing wage - which they won't because anyone hired becomes a kind of "high tech indentured servant."

I am a small business CPA with several middle-aged IT workers for clients who have lost their job and cannot find an equivalent replacement.

Thank you,
Richard C Schmitt, CPA
