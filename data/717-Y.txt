I think this proposal is great both for students(employees) and employers.

Firstly, currently the science, technology, engineering, or mathematics skills are most required among companies in U.S, so extending the OPT period by 24 months can help more talent students to work at U.S for longer time and make contribution for U.S. More inventions will be invented and the technologies will move forward faster.

This policy also make the education in U.S. more attractive since it provides more time for training and applying what students learned from university to the works in reality. This will lead more student from other places in the world to come to study to increase the diversity of our culture and make more contribution.

This proposal will both help companies have more talents and help attract more students to come for study. It will help a lot if be applied.
