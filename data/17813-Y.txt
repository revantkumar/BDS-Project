I think government should expand F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. As more and more foreign students come to U.S, America companies will have more and more chances to pick talented students and more and more hard-working students will contribute their work in America. They will have longer training terms to show their talent and their commitment in companies if you could expand OPT. And students with STEM degrees definitely will work hard compared to NON-STEM students since they have chosen a "hard" degree in college compared to other degrees such as Social Science. They want to contribute their knowledge and build somethings useful for all the mankind. If government allow them to learn and practice in U.S. where the top companies locates, they will be selected among other students and devote their time, money, knowledge in U.S.
