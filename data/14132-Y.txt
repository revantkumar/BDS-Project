I support the plan. Extension of OPT, as opposed to many people's perception, helps to further create jobs in the US in the long term. Although the US is accepting more foreign STEM students, in this case these students can help increase the number of consumers in the US, thus increasing domestic consumption. More American businesses can benefit from this increased consumer base. The number of jobs created in this process is more than the jobs that these students occupy, as a result of the economic multiplier.

These students are those who want to stay in the US and help contribute to the economy. Because the majority of them are highly-educated, their work helps drive up the productivity which again helps to develop the American economy.

As of foreign students taking up federal funds, the argument is flawed. Although the federal funds go to these students, they DO pay taxes like normal Americans, and their consumption in the US is effectively channelling the money back to the US economy. Overall the money is not flowing out.
