If you are so enamoured with foreign exchange students taking jobs from citizens and legal residents then might I suggest that you become one. Study abroad for 1 yr. and work in your country of choice for 3 yrs, that is if they will give you a work permit.
I think this should be mandatory for all the representatives and senators that fail to represent their constituents wishes. lest our representative and senators forget, we the people, are the ones that put you in office and not the lobbyist who contribute
huge sums of money from those they represent.
