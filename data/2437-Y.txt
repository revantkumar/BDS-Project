I strong think extension should be encouraged. Firstly, International students with Stem majors has contributed a lot to technical field. Secondly They have worked hard and they deserve the chance to work here. Thirdly, those students has paid big amount of tuition to colleges, without those people, some graduate school won't even have enough students to open the class. Fourthly, h1 is so hard to get, opt is a good choice, one year could be a good time for those people to finally become professional while if without h1 they are forced to leave here, which cause a big loss to the firm, they need to rehire and train candidates. Fifthly, without demand, there is no supply. Us market need more technical person because not enough domestic candidates or qualified technical person. Sixthly, the longer they stay here. The more they spend, increase GDP
