I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S, a lot of famous researcher were international when they came to the U.S and made big changes to the society.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Many international students are not employed with taking the chance of the natives. Instead, they give the companies high efficiency of employment and provide the best candidates for the position.
