I strongly SUPPORT the proposal

Firstly, students who learned knowledge from U.S university, no matter what countries they are from, they have professional knowledge and technical skills, which is contributed to the development of U.S. The proposal is a perfect chance for them to make contribution.

Secondly, U.S.A is an open and developed country. Diversity is very important for this country. Many experts in a lot of fields are international students before.

Thirdly, international students won't take up American's positions. Competition is a very good thing to improve every citizen's ability, which is also contributed to the progress of U.S.A
