I strongly support this policy. It is America's spirit of equality that attracts thousands of intellectual students to come here to seek better education and opportunities. This policy will attract even more students to come to America to realize their personal potentials and make their contributions to the U.S. economy. And a thriving economy will generate much more job opportunities than ever. So this is a win-win outcome and both foreign talented students and local job seekers can benefit from this policy.
