I oppose the proposed regulation.

1. The regulation does not show that there is any dearth of American students capable of taking high technology jobs, nor that there is a dearth of qualified workers. This regulation serves two purposes and two only: (1) to depress wages of American workers by providing the high tech industry with cheaper, foreign labor (which the regulation itself suggests by noting it has to bypass the H1B caps currently in place) and (2) to provide additional financial revenues for American colleges and universities, which can continue to profit from foreign OPT graduates. As a former university professor myself, I do not understand why any university would be interested in ensuring additional revenues for scholarship funds for American students if they can find full-freight tuition paying (often in cash) foreigners: despite the current Administration's rhetoric about making college available to all, this program merely makes it all the less incentivized for colleges to fund American students or high tech to hire them. There is no need for this gimmick program, and should be rejected.
