Megan Xu Because of my work in education research, I'm aware that many students 

I've spent the last few years in Boston and I met so many talented young people who are able to knock down tech jobs at some of the best companies in the US but they chose to devote themselves in academics and innovation. Rather than 'stealing jobs' from US citizens, many of these STEM students work hard to exchange ideas, blend in, connecting resources, and actually create jobs in many industries, not necessarily within the startup world, but also open up restaurants, supermarkets, and e-commerce. By allowing STEM students to work legally in the US will surely encourage more innovation and entrepreneurship, it's definitely a very positive thing. Why would anyone be deterred by prosperous industry development with big amount of influx of talents? 

I understand that many people are concerned about the competition in the job market, but one should also be aware that international students do not compete with domestic graduates at the same level, they would only be considered if there's no appropriate/sufficient candidate for a certain position. I believe this will hold true in the long run. The fact that under such circumstances, there are still thousands of STEM students working in the US, either under the internship visa (i.e., OPT) or H1B, meaning that the job market is still wide open, and it's not even a close-end space. More talents, more energy and exchanges, and a growing industry and businesses.
