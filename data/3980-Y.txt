I fully support the new change of increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months instead of the current 17 months. I believe this increased duration of practical training is important for students to fully utilize the education they received. International paid much more money to the education system in states and they deserve a better chance to get paid back and contribute to the country as well. I personally came from a lower-middle class family from China, and my parents used up all their savings for my grad school tuition here. Now they don't have any money left for retirement and even have to pay the loans from bank. It is my time to get a job in United States and become responsible for paying back the loans, as well as contributing my knowledge learnt. I'll appreciate a lot if the new policy gets approved.
