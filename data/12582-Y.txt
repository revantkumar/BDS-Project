I firmly support the new OPT Stem Extension rule based on two reasons.

First, looking back to history of United States, foreign talents made huge contribution to every field of this strongest nation. Albert Einstein, a Germany-born physicist, traveled from Germany to USA because of its advanced quality of science research and free policy for Jews. He developed the general theory of relativity, and helped United States win the race to build the atomic bomb, which finally terminated the World War 2. David Ho, a Taiwanese American HIV researcher who is famous for pioneering contributions to treatment of AIDS. His Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy saved so many people tortured by HIV. 

Second, if we cancel the extension rule, what will happen to United States? This nation will lose so many young talents to work for this country because it is so hard to get work visa, and then restrict innovative invents in various areas such as IT, natural science, military, finance, and so on. If a country loses its creativity, it cannot maintain power and also no longer dominate the world.

In conclusion, foreign talents are beneficial to United States. We need to try our best to stay them to make contribution to this nation, not to create obstacles to keep them away. They are always precious properties to United States. Therefore, I firmly support the new OPT Extension rule.
