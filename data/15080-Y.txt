Bill Liu I supported the OPT extension. Here is reason:
Let's see first why we have OPT

Enabling continued extended OPT for qualifying students with experience in STEM fields is consistent with DHS's Study in the States initiative, announced after the 2008 IFR in September 2011 to encourage international students to study in the United States. That initiative particularly focused on enhancing our nation's economic, scientific and technological competitiveness by finding new ways to encourage talented international students to become involved in expanded post-graduate opportunities in the United States. The initiative has taken various steps to enhance and improve the Nation's nonimmigrant student programs.

So one of the important reasons is that it will make US education more competitive than other nation's for example UK and Europe cause they do not provide such opportunity.
