This regulation is beneficial to both US companies and eligible F-1 students. As an employee in a large IT company, I graduated with a M.S degree in Computer Science and rely on OPT to continue training and working for the company. Currently there are a lot of employees who are in the same situation as mine. Eligible F-1 students expect to continue contributing to this company and many other companies as well in the future after the training is over. According to several researches and surveys, there are a huge gap between supply and demand for software engineers, a major part of STEM related jobs, where eligible F-1 students may fit in.

The usual choice is pursuing a H1B working visa, however, as a matter of fact, the amount of visas issued each year falls far behind US companies' demand. It's hard to continue contributing to the same company without being interrupted by a short OPT period. 

STEM students aren't taking jobs away from Americans now or in the future. Due to the inherent difficulty in doing a STEM degree, there aren't enough students who will become qualified workers in related fields from the very beginning, when people select their majors and professions. And current OPT regulation already makes it clear, it's not allowed to do training unrelated to our majors, not even physics major to computer science.

Therefore by measure of overall impact instead of looking at occasional outliers (which can be eliminated by enforcing the regulation more strictly), this regulation benefits both US companies and eligible F-1 students, which contributes to the economy and society as a result.
