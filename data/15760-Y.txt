I FULLY SUPPORT the OPT extension proposal and believe it will continue helping U.S. economy grow faster and better!

Objections made here are actually for individual benefits instead of for the sake of the overall economy and job market development.
a.Talented immigrants have been one of the sources of U.S. fastest growth and countries who refuse to embrace talents, skills, and beneficial competition have been experiencing much slower growth.

b.International students are NOT as described as cheap labor or using U.S. funds. This is the STEM area were talking about and as long as theyre hired the SALARY is way ABOVE average salary level in the U.S.

c.The cause of lower salary is OUTSOUORCING and once therere fewer qualified candidates in the STEM pool those corporate will only turn to OUTSOURCING, NOT hiring local American STEM students!! THIS, NOT the stem opt, will lead to lower salaries in STEM industries instead of increasing it.

d.The extension is ONLY for STEM students, NOT ALL INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS. U.S. needs more talents only because the country NEEDS it.


The objection can be as loud as it wants, but it actually will only hurt the U.S. job market in a longer term and eventually drag down the fast-growing economy.

I give this proposal my FULL SUPPORT.
