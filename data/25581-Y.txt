I strongly support this program because I believe this extension can bring many benefits to United States.
1. STEM students can help US run in front of the world. Thousands of them are working in Google, Mircosoft, Amazon, etc. All of the fantastic products couldn't success without their contribution. 
2. This program could attract more talent people to US to improve and perfect our education system. We have already seen many many talent foreign students in our top universities. They performed very well, they are creative, hard working. They helped us to maintain our high education in the top of earth. 
3. International students will bring fresh blood to our economy. Many universities and local business are welcome international students. Because they spend billions on retail stores, cars, real estate. etc and their tuition fee is 3 times more than in-state students.
