I strongly SUPPORT the new OPT extension rule, for the following reasons. 

To begin with, OPT extension would attract more brilliant international students to the USA. The students would prefer continuing their study in the USA over other countries like UK or Canada because of the new OPT extension. The increased number of international students will not enhance the academic ability of US higher education, but also boost the economy. Because international students pay high tuition fees and consume goods and service including renting houses, buying cars, so on and so forth.

Secondly, 12 months of OPT would limit the time international students have to gain working experience. In contrast, 24 months more means international students would be more competitive in their home country. A majority of international students will go back to their home country. I myself is planning to go back to China where my international background would be appreciated most. If I could gather 2 more years' of working experience, that will give me a great edge in finding jobs in China job market.
