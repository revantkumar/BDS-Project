The extension of OPT will do good to the development of America, because it will help hold many brilliant students working for the America and the native American people will also benefit from that by improving themselves a lot so that they will compete with those outstanding foreign students. As a result, this will not only help improve the level of capacity of employers, but also do much good to the development of social development. As I believe that only strong that survives, there will not be unfair competition due to the extension of OPT, and it will actually make everyone prepared for every upcoming opportunity.
