Liyun Zhu Dear Sir or Madam,

How do you do!

As an Ocean Engineering PhD student at Texas A&M University, I think the 24-month STEM OPT means too much for international students who are studying in U.S. now!

For one thing, students can apply what they have learnt to real application by participating in the OPT, they can better know their career orientation and get a bigger and more clear picture on how to fit their research for the requirements in their study field; For another, with more and more international students coming to U.S. studying in the STEM field, the chance for F1 students getting H1B visa are much smaller than previous years, without 24-OPT extension, many of them have to leave U.S. due to lack of lawful working permit. If so, several years later, fewer students will come to U.S. for studying in STEM field, which will be a big loss for U.S. STEM field.

I sincerely hope you honored officer can approve the 24-month STEM OPT and thank you very much!

Yours sincerely,
Liyun Zhu
