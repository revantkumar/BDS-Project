Why so many people are scared by this policy ? 
Do not be fooled by the people who are trying to link this policy to the employment of the Americans. Most of them against this policy just because they are frustrated by the job hunting. They are complaining almost everything they can. 
The OPT extension deals with the E-verify companies. As a hiring manager with more than 20 years experience, my observation is: most jobs targeted by the unemployed Americans lie beyond those corporations. So this policy is to fill the gaps rather than disturb the job markets.
