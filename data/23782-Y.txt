I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:
1. It's the American spirit to give equal opportunities to everyone.
2. It's beneficial to all high-tech corporations because international STEM talents have been contributing all the time.
3. It can attract more students to come to US which will greatly benefit US education system and economy.
