I strongly surport this rule as STEM student for the following reasons:

1, the United States advocate fairness and freedom as American spirits so everyone including hardworking foreigners deserve at least longer opportunity to practice what they learnt.
2. STEM foreign graduates are valuable to the US as shortage of Native American working in those fields. Indeed lots of competition in majors like finance, accounting, economics etc, but no company or institution will survive without foreigners in STEM majors. Hence they deserve more practice time to find out whether the US is the right place to work.
3. Talents will be lost if this proposed rule fail to pass through. This is crucial as no matter when the US always needs STEM talents to strengthen the science and technology of this country to be one of the leaders in the world. So why reject foriegn talents who are willing to contribute?
4, Last but not least, longer OPT equals more foriegn talents working for the US, which equals more potential immigrants, which leads to more potential US citizens. The end result will be more talented American. 

Passing through this rule is not an issue of shutting off foreigners protecting Americans, but is to put long-term investment on STEM foreign students and believe they will return a lot in the future.
