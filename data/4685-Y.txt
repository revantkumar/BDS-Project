OPT extension is a must to keep the talented individuals in US and support our economy. In this competitive world every individual should be given fair chance to prove their talent. The best will always survive in the industry, no matter what. People talk about H1B extension after OPT. Isn't harsh to deny H1B for students who are educated over here. what about people applying H1B and L1 from other country. when people from other countries can come and work over here, we cannot deny people studying in our universities. There are people who come to US on visitors visa and so on and settle here. Later they sponsor their parents and relatives and get GC, thus they are settling in US and run their own business. We need to concentrate on those people who are sponsoring their relatives and thus letting them settle here by using the loopholes in our system.

OPT students should be allowed to work here and use the opportunities that are available to them, to help our country in many ways.
