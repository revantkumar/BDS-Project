Support For extending training period for F1 international students. For employers, they would spend more human resources on recruiting new candidates if OPT holders did not transferred to H1B in only one year of time. That actually is a big disadvantage for companies seeking for reserve money. For F1 students, one year is too short to finish a training period. A project may not be finished in one year, if someone leaves before her or his work get down, others need spend tons of more time and money on it.
