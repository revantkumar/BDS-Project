I SUPPORT to extend STEM students OPT period. Skilled international students who get their advanced degrees in the US need more time to practice what they've learnt after graduation. This extended OPT STEM rule will benefit both STEM F-1 students as well as US high tech companies. These companies have great contribution to the US economy, and they need STEM students to work for them because most of these jobs cannot find suitable US citizens to fill them. Extension of STEM OPT will definitely be a WIN-WIN policy.
