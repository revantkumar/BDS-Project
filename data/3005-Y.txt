Thanks to DHS for expanding 17 to 24 months.Ofcourse there might be some pros n cons in all areas and nothing is 100% perfect in world.But we try to make it perfect by some means to the possible extent.I have seen a comment from Mr Xxxxx saying about indian IT consultancies and their way of exploiting jobs of americans by some other means of proxy interviews and all.But one should think that how much percentage of these things happening in whole market,might be for suppose1% - 10%.Then what about rest 90% of genuine people.Such kind of things happens in all countries and its a responsibility of IT companies to hire perfect people but not DHS or other governing body.Authoritative governing bodies can only make the rules to make country prosperous and to create opportunities, but cannot go deep into every IT company procedures.Probably one should know much amount money comes to USA education sector from international students.

Finally i would like to thank DHS for trying to expand STEM OPT keeping in mind about genuine people who strive hard for excellence and who came to golden land of opportunities for masters by investings lot of money.So this will be a chance for students to get back their investment within these 36 months of OPT.
