I highly support and vote for extending the STEM to 24 month. I am now in OPT first year period and working in the world largest GIS company. Three years ago, I was elected from a very competitive environment to get the admission into a University in United States. Then I have been educated here for three years for a master degree. In these three years, I have been working very hard to finish my education. After graduation, I get a decent job and salary. I make contributions to the industry in United States. The reason that I chose to make my career here, rather than Europe, Japan or my home country is because we know that United States honor talents and skills. We have the opportunity to find our position in market and demonstrate our talents and skills. Because of OPT and STEM, we are able to stay after graduation to make our contributions to the areas where we are good at. We are making more jobs for U.S. citizens. We are not taking away the jobs. We are contributing more in the GDP than those normal people who are lazy to develop themselves, thus increasing the income for everyone in average. If the STEM extension is not guaranteed, I believe nobody would ever want to come here for further education. The talent work force would definitely be transited to other countries. U.S. will lose the power and monopoly in every area of engineering.
