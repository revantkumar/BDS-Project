I strongly support this new OPT extension. I am an international student from China and major in education tech. Before came to US I had different offer for my master study in different countries including UK, Australia and I ended up to choose US because of the training opportunities for this major in US can help me better practice what I learn after graduation.

I think OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this opt extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign student to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with other better policy to foreign stem talents.

If this rule is terminated, I think it will be definitely a huge disaster to most of US high tech companies like google, apple and ect. Meanwhile, for many high education organization, it will be also a disaster for them as they won't able to attract as many foreign students as before, which from finance and diversity perspective, will be a big lost for them.
