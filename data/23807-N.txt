DO NOT EXTEND the OPT Program, in fact, have the foreign students leave after graduation and if they work during school take all regular taxes including SS taxes out of their pay and pay them the prevailing wage as paid to Americans. 

Put the American students ahead of the foreign students and not have the American students pay taxes and set the playing field in the favor of the Americans NOT the foreigners! Give the American students the best opportunity so they can get good experience for good jobs and grow our economy. 

The OPT program disincentivizes U.S. companies to hire American students and recent graduates. Increasing the plan creates even less opportunities for Americans and creates more opportunities for Non Americans at the expense of American students and workers

"This is a Bad Program to start with and expanding the program does even more damage to Americans while favoring non-Americans. It doesn't make sense to give more to Outsiders than to Americans!! Especially since this Program is in violation of Congressional intent." It is a slap in the face of American students and workers as is and worse to expand it.

Please do not extend the OPT Program.
