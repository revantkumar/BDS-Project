It is almost beyond my comprehension that the legal American citizen is illiterate to the denigration of the United States that this administration is doing. Bordering on criminal actions, giving preference to foreign nationals in ANY employment opportunity vs. qualified American citizens is certainly immoral at the least.

When the U.S. has had the weakest economy since 2008 and the highest unemployment too, why would you want to increase the ability to higher foreign workers in place of qualified citizens. These STEM workers are not the typical illegal aliens that invade our country to work at "jobs Americans won't do", which in itself is a falsehood, these typical STEM jobs pay between $60 and $90K per year.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it breaking the law to overstay a Visa? Isn't this one of the prime areas where these workers come from? Government, it is time to do your job! Send them back!

My view is supported by "Both sides of the isle" and you can see there comments and facts below. My request is not to increase the OPT limit but rather to reduce the existing limit.
