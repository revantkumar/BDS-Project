This proposal is effective and should be passed because it is critical that those students who have invested in an American STEM higher education degree be encouraged and incentivized to remain in the United States and contribute their STEM skillsets to grow America's economy. Increasing the OPT period to 3 years in total would benefit the STEM degree recipients by equipping them with a greater number of years of active productive work experience, and financially enriching our nation's economy.
