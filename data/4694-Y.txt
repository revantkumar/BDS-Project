I strongly SUPPORT this new rule because it is going to greatly benefit USA.

1. The quotation "All men are created equal" is the core American spirit. This is why talented people come to USA from all over the world, which makes USA the best nation in the world. 
IF THIS RULE FAILS, IT WILL DAMAGE THIS AMERICAN SPIRIT.

2. These STEM F-1 students with advanced degrees are highly possible to become the mainstay in their professional fields and could greatly contribute to the economy of USA. 
IF THIS RULE FAILS, THESE STUDENTS WILL LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THE ECONOMY OF USA.

For example, Kunal Bahl, a Wharton graduate as part of the dual degree M&T Engineering and Business program at U-Penn had to come back to his own country because of OPT failure. Then he started Snapdeal.com in India which is called "Indian Groupon". This company created 5000+ jobs and made $91 million in 2012. This could happen in USA if he could stay in USA. 
IF THIS RULE FAILS, USA WILL LOSE MANY TALENTED PEOPLE LIKE KUNAL.

3. The USA education system spends many efforts to train these foreign students and thus these young promising students are supposed to contribute to this nation. 
If this rule fails, they have to go back to their own country right after the graduation, which means USA trains all these top level students for other countries freely.

4. The competition between nations is actually the competition between people. Canada, Singapore and many other countries have many startup-friendly policies and USA falls behind these countries. Some high quality STEM students could create new "Facebook"s and new "Google"s in the future.
If this rule fails, it will harm the future development of USA.
