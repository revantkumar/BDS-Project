I strongly agree of this rule, and I am looking forward that it can get approved.

Some people says that extending the OPT will put more F1 sutdents in the labor pool, and few jobs for local workers. However, it is not the case. In high tech industry, United states companies are in desperate need of talented minds. F1 students coming from STEM field has the potential to help these companies to expand and make innovations. Only when companies scales expands can it provide more jobs for local people and pay more tax to ensure national security. 

It is a good thing!
