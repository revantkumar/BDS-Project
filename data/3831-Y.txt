OPT extension is very welcome! The importance about OPT is to attract international students and help the U.S. higher education institutions be more competitive against UK, Australia, Germany, Switzerland , etc. Without offering OPT to international students, they will not consider the U.S. as a no brainer when choosing which country they want to go. The OPT program definitely helps students to gain more industry experience and better prepare them for finding a job in their home country. Not only the 12-month standard OPT is crucial in attracting international students, who bring billions of dollars to the U.S. each year to contribute local economy in a great deal, but also the 24-month OPT extension is the key to ensure that the training for international students is complete. Since I did not win the H1b visa lottery this year, I am currently working with my OPT extension, and I am involved in projects that last more than a year. With low probability of winning the H1b visa, the OPT extension is definitely needed to ensure a complete training. It also benefits American companies because they dont need to find a new employee every year to replace those who are on OPT and dont win the H1b visa lottery. Hiring new people is also a significant cost to the company. And its not easy to find a good candidate for positions that require an education level of college or college above. With insufficient supply of U.S. STEM educated workers, the international STEM students are help the U.S. economy run smoother, faster, and stronger. Overall, I welcome the 24-month OPT extension and hope the new rules be implemented ASAP.
