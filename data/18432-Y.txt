I'm working in a software company now. This is my first year and I'm learning a lot and wish I can learn more. But only one year's OPT is definitely not enough compared to what I want to learn in this company. Besides, I went to school with a national ranking top 100 and most of the graduate students are foreigners. And as in this software engineering field, from what I can see, there are definitely not enough Americans working in this field. So people like me we are not here to take Americans' job, we are here to study and trying to make this country better and ourselves better. Besides, cancel the OPT extension will cause tech companies like Google, Apple lose lots of intelligent new graduate students. Those are the people who can make huge profits for this country. So I hope the government can make the wise decision based on pros and cons of this OPT extension.
