I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion is unjust and unfair to Americans. It would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. This program creates an incentive for companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.
