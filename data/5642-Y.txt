I support this rule. In my point of view, this rule will benefit American more than F-1 student, more importantly, and it is also quite informative. 
First of all, this rule is proposed based on a background -- ALWAYS CITIZEN FIRST! This is very obvious if you have read the proposal. 
Secondly, H1 visa is becoming more and more difficult to get, so extend OPT is very necessary to compliment the lack of H1 opportunities. Do American people want more H1 holders who has larger opportunity to stay permanently? Or just extending 24 months for STEM OPT workers? I believe the GOV is trying to find a balance between this, and this is why GOV wants to extend STEM OPT. 
Thirdly, international students only want to work not to immigrate, they miss home, they will finally return to a place where they are called CITIZEN!

BTW, please get this comment posted.
