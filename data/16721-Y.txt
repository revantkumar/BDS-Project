I support the new regulation on improving and expanding OPT for F1 nonimmigrant students with STEM Degrees and cap-gap relief for all eligible F1 students.

I would like to use my current teams example to explain why I support this regulation. I worked at an US IT company that everyone uses its websites almost everyday. Two of my recently joined teammates are graduating from top universities in US with a Master degree. They are very smart and productive BUT they will have to leave our team if this regulation cannot go through. 

If this cannot happen, in short term, it will be harder for engineering teams from all tech companies to find good fits for openings. In long term, this will impair US attraction for those emerging talents all over the world and their countries of origin would be pretty eager to try everything to make their promising freshmen stay. US citizens rights and benefits should definitely always be our top priority, but we also don't want to see next Facebook s created in India or China other than US. 

We have to realize that though we offer OPT for all eligible F1 students, only those top ones can finally make a stay and their stay will keep our leading positions in the world. And we have to realize that a prosperous US is the prerequisite for us to make our lives better!
