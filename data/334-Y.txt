Anderson Gary The DHS is overstepping its legal boundries. These kinds of decisions belong to the Congress of the United States.
To proceed along this path will not only destroy our economy but create discontent among our citizenry. Rights of
foreign students should never trump the rights of the student citizens of these United States. It is hard for me to wrap
my mind around the lack of foresight that runs rampant in the minds of the leadership of our country!
