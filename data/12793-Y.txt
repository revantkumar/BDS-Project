I strongly support the proposal of extending OPT by another 24 months. I am going to work as a postdoc researcher in Stanford University. I think extended OPT is critical for postdoc researchers in these top universities because of two reasons. First, most of postdoc researchers in Stanford University and University of Massachusetts Amherst (where I got my PhD) use OPT during their postdoc. If they do not have OPT, they have to go back to their countries, which is definitely a significant loss to the academic world in US. Second, most postdoc researchers need to work for at least two years. Some postdoc researchers, such as those who work on biological research, have to work for around five years. Without extended OPT, most postdoc researchers cannot finish their research before their OPT expires. So I strongly suggest extending the OPT by another 24 months, which definitely benefits the whole academic research in US.
