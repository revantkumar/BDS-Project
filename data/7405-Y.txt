The proposal is a strongly welcome move. Given how the STEM extension helps in retaining talent and further boost the growth in the fields of technology, the improvement and expansion of training opportunities is of utmost importance. One of the major motivations of many of the foreign students studying in the US is to gain a good work experience by working in an environment that is leading in innovation. This again boosts the education industry and hence the whole economy itself. More jobs cannot be created by cutting jobs but by growth. So the logic that such a move might be a competition to the citizens for getting jobs is entirely baseless and short sighted. Overall the proposal is a great move which would lead to creation of more jobs and opportunities and strengthening the economy further.
