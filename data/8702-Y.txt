I am an international student in F-1 status and I strongly support the STEM OPT extension. The benefit of OPT extension is the upmost important reason for me to choose the Unite States as a country to study abroad. My program requires intensive real-world practice in the industry to reinforce my knowledge, which might take 2~3 years. Therefore the STEM OPT extension is really important for my professional growth. 
OPT extension plays significant role in attracting international students and promote US's economy. Implement OPT extension can also increase the diversity of the field and absorb ideas from different minds raised in different backgrounds. 
Therefore I strongly hope the STEM OPT extension can be continuously implemented.
