The proposed rule provides a great opportunity for international students to enhance their education and practical skills in the US after graduation. 

The highlight is that the students who previously earned a STEM degree can apply for a 24-month OPT extension as well in the related STEM field/occupation. This greatly helps those students who earned a STEM degree in the US, who only used their initial 12-month OPT before, and currently enrolled in a MBA or management-related field in the graduate school. This proposal rule can help those students to enhance their STEM skills in US corporations and may also prepare them for managerial role when they go back to their home country. 

I completely support the entire proposal.
