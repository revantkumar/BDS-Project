Dear Sirs: I am opposed to expanding the OPT program for foreign students with visas due to the unfair job market it creates for American students and American graduates with stem degrees. The expansion of this foreign student worker program will drive down wages because companies do not have to pay the going rates to these foreign student workers or graduate workers nor does the company or the worker contribute to Social Security required for American workers with stem degrees. This program gives financial incentives to companies to hire foreign students and graduates with stem degrees, therefore pushing the American students and graduates out of this field or forcing American workers to take lower wages.
