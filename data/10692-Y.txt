I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. Here are several thoughts of mine:

1. What makes U.S such a great country? The answer is very obvious. It's all because of its acceptance to good ideas, inventory skills and talented people from all over the world. 
2. What makes these STEM majors are so special? The lack of American citizens who's willing to study or work on those jobs. I don't think it's necessary to count how many students in STEM majors are Americans. Just by one glance, we already know the answer can be less than 20%! We all know those STEM majors are difficult to learn. Most of the time they can easily make students frustrated. That's why less and less American students are willing to choose STEM as their major. Then who's gonna do the job after graduation? Immigrants! Absorbing oversea talented people is the only way to fill the hole where there is not enough labors.
So my conclusion is the government should let the students who learn knowledge from U.S. universities keep making contributions to the U.S society. It's better to obtain more talented people to contribute to this country rather than to teach them, prepare them and then keep them away and lose those precious resources.
