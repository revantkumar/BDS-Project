I support the proposal for many reasons, most importantly, keeping these STEM students in the US is a win-win situation for both sides.
STEM students have received extensive training at US schools and they bring significant contributions to not only academia researches, but also technological advancements. 
It is a smart move to keep this work force in America to sustain its economic and technological growth. I don't see STEM graduates taking jobs from Americans, in fact, they help to expand the US economy and provide a more active job market in the US.
