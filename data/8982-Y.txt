Mei Liu This good news for all international students. First of all it allows me to work longer after school and get more on hand experience, which is very useful when I get back to China. Nowadays with the increase of out of broad study, the abroad work experience has become more of a factor to value a student's skills. This purpose will definitely benefit millions of international students like me. Second, with the longer OPT for STEM students, America can attract more international students to come here to study. Therefore, it increases diversity of schools. Also, with more and better international students coming to US to study, it will make more of a competitive environment in colleges and I believe it would also help with campus drinking and drug problems. On the other hand, in recent years, there are more and more foreign students who finished a degree in the US and got a job offer with sponsorship, but could not stay to continue making contribution to the country just because of the H1B cap. With the extension of OPT, some of them might have another chance to win the lottery. I think losing foreign educated high tech labors is a big loss for America at this time when the economic is getting better and better. Before the government take any action on the H1B cap, this is a very effective way which benefits both foreign students and thousands of American companies.
