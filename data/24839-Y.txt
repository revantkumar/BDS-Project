I endorse this rule. 
If opt is just 12-month, many international students can't stay in USA and have to come back to their hometown. There will be a great loss to the engineering field. Nowadays, many students from other countries contribute a lot to technology and science field in USA. If they can't stay, much work can't be done, the company will be greatly influenced by the loss of students, and economy will be impacted definitely.
