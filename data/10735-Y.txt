I do not support this petition as it would violate rights of overseas students who are not majoring in STEM. The policy itself is a form of discrimination as it intentionally favors some international students over others and students are not judged by their talents but by what subject they are learning. Also, if the agency does an analysis on H1b petitions submitted by companies, it is clear not all STEM students are well sought after. There are more companies submitted H1b petitions for graduates majoring in accounting, finance, marketing or other business field over many science subjects. Why should only STEM majors enjoy the favor to get extension on their OPT? OPT extension, if necessary, should base on needs: meaning that whoever could get H1b sponsorship but did not worked out in the H1b cap "luck draw" should get OPT extension to allow them a second chance to get their H1b visa. Their full-time employment offer already approved they are in need by the US. OPT extension should be given to graduates who are needed by industries rather than giving to students in certain majors. All students that have employer sponsorship should be eligible to opt extension. Otherwise, it is a discrimination and will hurt talented students who are not majoring in STEM and in a long run, this will hurt social diversity and cultural and business innovation in the US.
