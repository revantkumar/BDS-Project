Jason Lin 1. Improving and expanding OPT for F1 STEM students is important for US economy. In STEM fields, students could become very productive and creative right after their graduation (PhD or MS) at the age of 25-30. OPT provides the opportunities for these young people to exploit their talents and contribute to the economy. 

2. It is also against the interest of the country to send those talented F1 student back to their home countries after investing billions of dollars in their education. Almost all the F1 PhD students reply on fellowship or school stipends to finish their 5-7 year study. If graduate education is long-term investment, the actual return just starts after graduation.

3. Companies are still hiring F-1 students despite their visa complication and language proficiency. Simply because there are not enough suitable US residents for all the job openings in STEM fields. Jobs won't created in the long run by forcing companies to lower technical requirements for jobs and losing competitiveness. In contrast, jobs will be created if the US tech companies are doing great, expanding the business and driving the economy. A free employment market brings prosperity to the economy, which always benefit the majority of American people.
