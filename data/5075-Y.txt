I strongly against the argument that this policy hurts the U.S. economy and the job securities of the U.S. citizens. This policy will not "crowd out" skilled U.S. citizens, and what's more, will even improve the productivity and innovation level of the U.S. economy, which in turn benefits the companies in the U.S. and generates more job opportunities for U.S. citizens. Although there hasn't been studies on the direct effect of the proposed policy yet, many existing studies have shown statistically significant improvement in the local level of productivity and innovation brought by high-skilled workers retained through the H1-B program, a policy with the similar goal of STEM extension. Refer to the following two papers from Harvard Business School and University of California, Davis:

The Supply Side of Innovation: H-1B Visa Reforms and US Ethnic Invention - Harvard Business School
"Most specifications find weak crowding-in effects or no effect at all for native patenting.Total invention increases with higher admission levels primarily through the direct contributions of ethnic inventors."

STEM workers, H1B Visas and Productivity in US Cities - UC, Davis
"The magnitudes of these estimates imply that STEM workers contributed significantly to total factor productivity growth in the US and across cities and also, but to a lesser extent, to the growth of the skill biased during the 1990-2010 period."

The sentiment of certain local job-seekers may be understood, in the sense that they are afraid of the competition brought by these highly educated international students transforming into high-skilled workers through the STEM extension program. However, this competition will benefit the employers and U.S. economy as a whole, and will eventually benefit these job seekers in the long run through a more vivid U.S. economy.
