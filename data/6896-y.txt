Nishit Pande I strongly support the F-1 OPT extension rule, I completed my MBA in the US and got a full scholarship, I completed two degrees in the time it takes to complete one, my MBA & MS was completed in two years, I was not a STEM student but had a choice to take up a masters in STEM area but i passed nonetheless I did not qualify in the H1B lottery the year after my graduation and after completion of my OPT period I left US, I was among the top 1% in my university but the one year OPT did not help me experience the US professional life and my company made every effort to keep me since I was one of the smartest people in the company wit patents pending. I really think that the 24 months extension will help STEM students become secure and work to their god given potential. I even propose that on a case by case basis you should also consider non STEM students that have a proven track record and are extremely smart to avail this extension. I think there could be certain checks that would allow a Non STEM student avail of this extension such as:
1. Professional experience (most helpful to top MBA school students)
2. Undergraduate in STEM (top engineering/Science School)
3. Company recommendation and proven track record
4. US Patents and certifications in STEM areas

These are some of the checks that might be performed before considering this change to proposal, I think law makers are extremely smart and intelligent people and a statistical analysis would make a strong case for this proposal to go through.
