I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

(1) Diversity is very important to the development of USA. OPT extension will let more genius make contributions to USA and then USA will become better and better. Being closed and self-fettered is really bad for a country which want to be thriving.

(2) Once every trade becomes thriving, there will be more job positions and higher public welfare for everyone living in the USA.
We should be open and inclusive!
