In my personal view, I think this is a act that shows exactly how USA emphasize what freedom is. The reasons are following:

First of all, it gives everybody a chance to chase their dream, it can help people to find their personal value. When some may say this may cause a competition for local people to seek for job, I don't see any reasons for that. To anyone, to live on this earth means to compete in everywhere, I should admit that, but to work with whom has F-1 visa students, may help local people to expand their view, may give them a chance to know what this culture really is, they can improve themselves by working with international students, also gives them a chance to work abroad.

Second, we all know cooperation makes difference, besides to get to know different culture, local may learn different ways to manage a company or to settle a issue, after all , minds are different, some ways may really efficient and those are things that can be learned, can be followed, can be owned, finally, can improve USA itself.

Last but not the least, we cannot ignore those F-1 visa students who really have talents, to work with them, would make USA better in the future
