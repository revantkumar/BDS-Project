Gill Zhang I highly support this bill to pass!

US is known for its openness and freedom. As part of the international student group, I can speak undoubtedly that many of us love this country, we are hard-workers, we have American dream, we would like to contribute to this country as a return for the opportunity of high-level education. We will make this country better!
