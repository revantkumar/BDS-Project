I am a graduate student studying at Carnegie Mellon University. I support this rule for following reasons:

First, it is good for American companies. Most programs and projects in companies last more than two years. If there is no OPT extension, companies would be forced to hire employees continuously, which would cost much more additional money and time on training new workers and constructing efficient teams. If new graduates can get more time with OPT, there will be no need for companies to worry about hiring newbies frequently. So that these companies can devote money and time to more important fields, like research and expansion. Take myself as an example. I did an intern last summer at a company. The company gave me a return offer since I became familiar with their development process during internship. They have no need to spend time and money to hire other people, which I think is a great help for the company.

Second, it is good for STEM industry. Why Google and Facebook are so unique in the world? Because they have creative people and have creative products. With extension of OPT, more people with creative thoughts would join these excellent companies. Thought spark generated by discussion between extraordinary people from all over world would lead to new advanced technology and even revolution in technology. In my opinion, this is great for American high-tech industries.

Third, it is good for local economy. When a F-1 student is working uder OPT visa, he needs a place to live and need to buy necessary home furniture to live well. It is beneficial for local real estate industry and economy. What's more, he needs to buy food, buy cars and etc. All of these can be a contribution to American's GDP.

So I support this OPT extension proposal and I think it is a really great one. It is beneficial not only to F-1 students but also most importantly to American people and American industry and economy.
