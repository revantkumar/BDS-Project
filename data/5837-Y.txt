I strongly support the extension. If a foreign student graduates college or grad school then finds a job here, they gotta be very good at what they are doing. By keeping the well skilled students here, it benefits the economy of US in the long run. US is the greatest country on the planet for a reason - it attracts the most outstanding people to come here from all over the world.
