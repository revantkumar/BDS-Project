Tao Guo I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

OPT extension time is a good length. Most large research/software development projects would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion.

Secondly, the government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S

Thirdly, the US economy development needs tech, which is stem students have. Retaining them is beneficial for US society.

Lastly, they pay large amount of tax for US.
