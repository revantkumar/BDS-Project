I am in favor of this proposal and I strongly support it.

It seems that if we have one immigrant do a job, one American will lose his or her job. But I say that's how those communists in China see their people so they have the ridiculous suicide family planning policy. They see people as burden, but in fact people can be producers. One well-educated immigrant can create 10 more job opportunities for Americans.
