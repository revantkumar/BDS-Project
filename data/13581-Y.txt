Although I personally is not a STEM student, I still think the argument for supporting this rule is compelling and well-reasoned. Here are my statements:

1. Foremost, this rule helps to achieve a practical goal for the American society as a whole. The US economy is getting its way out of the recession trap, and now in technology and creative industry, we are desirably demanding more talented and innovative employees to work in this field. Extension of OPT will create more job opportunities not only for the international students, but for the American citizens as well. This industry is one of the US most competitive features from the economic perspective in international trade system. 
2. Secondly, this rule diminishes some inappropriate actions of deriving legal status of residence and employment. I have seen some international students were seeking extension of CPT by registering in online community colleges in order to secure their jobs. With this rule as a defined paperwork, the legal framework of affirming potential immigrant's working opportunities will benefit the educational systems and homeland security.
3. Last but not the least, this rule poses a locus and nature of responsibility to the society's collective future. It encourages potentially new immigrants to make their own histories, cultures and paths towards the American dream. This rule considers the conception of public good for the American society as a whole, not just to a specific social group.
