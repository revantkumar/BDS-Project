I am very opposed to the OPT regulation because it allows foreign workers to take American jobs. Even a limited time of "training" can lead to opportunities to stay longer or permanently. It is our responsibility to train AMERICAN workers; not those from other countries. Also, all people working in our country should be paying payroll taxes.
