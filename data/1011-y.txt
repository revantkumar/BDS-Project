It's undeniable that technology and scientific development play an important role in a country, not matter from economy perspective or the whole national security perspective. Every country invest a lot of money in technology and engineering development nowadays and keep attracting excellent experts and engineers to their countries. The U.S., whose dominating status in science and technology is largely base on the contributions of scientific and technology expert immigrated from all over the world, should keep making tech-immigrant friendly policy to keep the STEM talents the future scientists and engineers staying here to maintain its leading position.
