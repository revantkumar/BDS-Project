I'm STEM PhD student. I believe in the great social benefits that would be brought by improved technology. An extended training opportunity means a better chance for immigrants in STEM majors to stay in US and pursuit their dreams, as well as a larger pool of talents that would continuously contribute to the advances and well being of the entire nation. Thus, I hope the new regulation could pass the congress.
