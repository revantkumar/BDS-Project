Hello,

I am for the proposed rule. With the influx of F-1 students increasing exponentially year after year, The US Department of Commerce has conclusive data that F1 students have contributed $27 Billion to the US economy during year 2013-2014 alone. The extension of stem extension would benefit both the student and the govt, job market and hence the overall economy.

Please do not leave the fate of 100,000 aspiring students hanging in the balance. Their lives matter too.

To get real facts about the impact of F1 students on the American Economy, Please visit:
