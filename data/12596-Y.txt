I highly support this proposal. The extension of OPT for STEM students provides high tek companies more opportunities to select proper researchers and workers. The last thing the citizens want is the decisions by the enterprises to move their research departments overseas, which is exacly what they do to their manufacture this decades. Lots of negative comments only mention how STEM immigrants prevent local STEM from employment. Few mention how the local STEM students fail to qualify the job requirements. This nation and its people should not be afraid of challenges and competitions. The local STEM students need the motivation to study hard in college instead of party all day. Please provide them confidence to defeat their foreign classmates in job markerts instead of sending the talent and hard working F1 students back to their countries once graduation. Please encourage the local students to pursue their PhD degree to win the competitions in science and technology instead of educating lots of foreign PhDs and send them back to your competitors. I believe the wise U.S. Citizens will always make the right decision.
