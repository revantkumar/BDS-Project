Anonymous This rule will be very beneficial to the economy of the US, creating more jobs for Americans in the long run. It would be helpful for technology, innovation, and humankind in general. It stands true to the principles of America and is highly desirable. I support this rule and would appeal to the DHS to bring this into effect as soon as possible.
