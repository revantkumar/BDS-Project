I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. STEM major students has learned knowledge from U.S. universities and continued to make contributions to U.S. society and economy.

2. The current 12 month OPT is too short for STEM major students. Most research and projects would take more than a year to have promising results. If STEM major students are not allowed to continue their research/project after a year, it would be a huge lost to the U.S. society and economy.

3. It took at least 4 years to finish a college degree, so STEM major students should have MORE time for OPT to use their knowledge and make contributions.
