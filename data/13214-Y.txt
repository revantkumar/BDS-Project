I strongly support OPT extension for another 24 months. STEM international students have solid knowledge background especially in math, physics, chemistry, biology, sciences, and engineering. They can contribute their intelligence, creativity, analysis capability, coding skill, diligence to the development of the U.S in area such as academic, IT and high tech industry. Most of these careers need people to hard working, thinking, and pay lots of time on work. International STEM students have been working hard in these areas and have done really great work. It's not enough if only give them 1 year to practice, because they need more time to service for the university/lab/company and produce outstanding outcomes. Extending OPT will not influence the job opportunity for the American citizens, because most of the job that STEM students could choose require hard working and very good math/science/coding background. Inverse their contribution will promote the employment of the American market.
