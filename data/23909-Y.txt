I highly support this proposed extension. This opportunity gives international students more time to have better experience in the most industrialized country. This extended OPT rule will benefit both F-1 students and the US technology companies. Without this rule, the 1 year opt can only guarantee students to work for US company for 1 year. Companies usually spend a few months in training a new employee and have to find a replacement in a year. With this new rule, companies can hire an F-1 student for up to 3 years which definitely will benefit production.It's American spirit to give everyone equal chance. Talented students who com to US to study deserves more time to practice their skills after graduation. It's good for US economy to have talented foreign people work in High Tech area. It's good for US education since longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study.
