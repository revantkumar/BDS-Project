I strongly support this proposal.

1. Many international students choose USA for its opportunity to get good job offer. If this proposal is objected, students out of USA will feel disappointed and those excellent student may choose university in a more friendly country such as UK or Canada, which may lower the rank of American education level. 

2. I don't think this proposal increase the immigration problem .As a Chinese applicant for the 2016 fall masters' university admission,I would say many of us are more willing to go back home after several years of work in USA instead of immigration so that we can look after our parents. However, we still want to work in USA for several years because this working experience makes us much more competitive in job seeking back in China.
