Officer,

I'm an international student major in Computer Science. Actually, before go to USA, I also got several other offers in world-top college from UK, but I still chose my college in USA. Why? Because we have the excellent OPT program. You know the industry experience are so important for an engineer and everything is different between school and real industry. The OPT program will not only gain the attractiveness of schools in USA but also help employers find the best employees. 

In a word, I came to USA because I want to learn knowledge as well as industry experience, I will regret my decision if OPT will be canceled and I strongly believe, there are fewer international students willing come to USA schools.
