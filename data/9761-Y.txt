Chi Zhang I am a international master student in USC majored in Computer Science. I strongly support this new OPT extension rule for the following reasons:

1. Before i chose to come to USC, i also received offers from other universities in other countries like Canada, UK, Dutch. the reason i chose USC is because of the 17 month OPT-extension. so i consider this new rule will help attract more talented students to study in USA and make contribution to USA.

2.this new rule will attract more international students, and these students will live near their university, they will pay the tuition rend house, go shopping and pay the tuition, which will be great contribution to the local economy.
