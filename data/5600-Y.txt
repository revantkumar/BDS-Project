Dear Sir/ Ma'am,
If enacted, the proposed rule will be a big relief for STEM F1 students who have traveled across oceans in search for fulfilling their "American" dreams despite all the risks involved. These STEM students are the ones who have and who will, add to America's growing technological and economic prowess. I wholeheartedly support this ruling and hope that it gets passed.

Thanks!
