E Ahmed I support the STEM OPT extension proposed rule. I am currently on H-1B and working for a company. Many of my co-workers are also international students and they are on OPT until they get H-1B. They are talented, hard working and good for US economy. Since H-1B based on lottery and it is becoming difficult to get day by day, this STEM OPT extension rule will definitely help these students to continue working for these companies.
