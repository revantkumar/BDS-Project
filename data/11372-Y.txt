I strongly support the proposal of STEM extension. I think it's beneficial to be open-minded to international students and non-immigrant workers. Many IT companies rely on international students contributions to the company. Working together with international students is not a disaster even a bad case. If an international student is not qualified, no company will provide her/him with the position and offer. Also these students provide a chance to boost the U.S.s economy, like doing great jobs in Google and Facebook. They developed excellent products to increase the profit margin of the companies. These companies are the grounding stones of the U.S. economy.
