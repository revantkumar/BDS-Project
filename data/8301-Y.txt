I strongly support this new rule (or another version of the previously existed). I am a H1B holder working in new york city and I have seen people from all around the world, working so hard to get their job done, being absolutely capable to handle their tasks nicely, making a great contribution to the United States in many senses. These people, mostly if not all, accepted the highest education from US (master or PhD). They deserve an opportunity to share their knowledge and passion here in the United States. As an immigration country, it is also a great opportunity for the government to show the fairness of human society, races, genders etc as well as the attitude toward yound and passionate people with a strong will to make their contribution. 

STEM immigrants have shown their power and value in the past decades or centuries. That's part of the reason why America has become today's level and greatness. I do not see a reason why stopping this from happening.
