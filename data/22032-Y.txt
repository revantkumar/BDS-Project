First of all, this regulation is good, it will attract more smart people to contribute to United States, many companies can get benefit from hiring low cost (US government does not need to pay any money for their education) but talented workers to build innovating stuff. 

Secondly, people is the future of a country, smart people is the future of the top-1 country on this earth. The country which can attract the most amount of smart people will win the competition in the next century. 

Last but not least, U.S needs various of people in different education levels, since the government has already grant a lot of illegal immigrants to stay, we have no reason to refuse legal students to contribute their strength to this country. If we do, they will go back and contribute to our competitors like China, Russia, etc. It is stupid to drive out smart people out of U.S.
