I believe the extended OPT is an integral part of the studying experience for those international students who receive higher education in the united state.

This is also a good opportunity for all the companies that are seeking qualified employees. A larger selection of applicant from all over the world can remarkably increase the productivity and creativity of companies in the U.S., thus maintain a competitive figure in the world.

For the equal right and opportunity to be employed, the lower salary(if any) of employees under OPT should not be the used against the extended OPT campaign.
