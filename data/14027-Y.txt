I think many of US high tech companies need STEM major talents. It is how United States are strong and leading the world. Some people who are short sighted may accuse the international students take away job opportunities.This is not true, the market actually needs way more people than it already have especially in IT area. The government is now encouraging more people to do STEM major but it is still not enough. If all people are fired because of OPT problem, there will be a heavy toll on those US companies and it will be for US economy in the end.
The reason I like US is that it is an immigrant country. It is better than any other country is that it can absorb all talents from all over the world. For those who are against immigrants, you ancestor was once an immigrant too. They build a great nation now and this is what we are doing too, using our talents.
