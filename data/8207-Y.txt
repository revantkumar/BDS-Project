I was a computer science professor in the U.S. from 1983 to 2014. I am currently chief scientist at a private technology company. There is no shortage of qualified U.S. citizens in STEM fields. There is no reason to extend the OPT program except to increase company profits at the expense of unemployed (or currently employed but soon to be laid off) U.S. citizens.
