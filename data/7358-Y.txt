Songyan Xie I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. Many professors of the STEM field in the universities of the United States were international students before. They can enhance the technology strength of the US. This proposal can make more qualified international students to stay in the US after graduation to make contributions to America.
2. Most international students in the top universities in the United States are very excellent. For example, international students in UCLA must maintain a minimum GPA for 3.0 every quarter. This makes sure that the international students of STEM field who can earn their degree are very excellent. These students can and are able to make great contribution to the technology company in America and improve the economy of the US.
3. There are many new technology companies in the US who need many qualified staffs to improve them. Thus, there will be many opportunities for both the natives and the international students. Therefore, more STEM international students in the US DOESN'T MEAN many natives will lose their jobs.
