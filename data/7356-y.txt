Jessie Ji Right now, one-year OPT shuts STEM students from consistent training programs by a number of US-based global companies, which later could lead us to career opportunities not only in the States but globally, either working in their motherland or in the states. Extension on OPT hopefully could change this situation so that those big companies would be more willing to hire OPT students to get training and assign them work overseas later in the career.
