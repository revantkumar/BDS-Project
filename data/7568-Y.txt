Stephen Lau I support this proposal.

Based my experience, a stem major citizen can 10 times easier land a job than foreign students. But companies are still looking for foreign students to fill the spots because they really cannot find enough qualified citizens.

Because of some education issues, America is lack of labors in Stem and OPT is one of the solution. Those foreign students who receive American education and practice their skills with OPT will be a way of supplement.

From the immigration's perspective, the OPT is not anyway close to a cause of America's immigration issue, the illegal immigrants are hundred of thousands more than STEM students. It is ridiculous to kick the high educated people who pay tax out of the country while there is bigger issue hanging there.

To hire a foreign student, the company will have to pay a lot more money to maintain their immigration status and in my company citizens and foreigner got the same salary, and qualified citizens are always been chose over foreigner, if the company can find one. Therefore this rule won't steal jobs from Americans, but it not just only help America boost its economy also, it steals smart people from America's competitors.

It is insane to deny this proposed rule.
