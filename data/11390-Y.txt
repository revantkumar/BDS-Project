This is the best way for America to get highly intelligent people from other countries for free. Suppose other countries pay 250,000$ for a master degree student in science field, but America only provides a job and get these 250,000$ for free. Besides, every engineer job can yield value at least twice as much as it's salary. There is no reason for us to deny this.
