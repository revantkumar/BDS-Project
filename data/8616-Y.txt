This rule is a good idea. I am an international student studying biochemistry in a PhD program. In our department, about 2/3 students and post-docs are from other countries. We contribute a lot to achieve scientific projects, which results in hundreds publications in academic journals every year and some get published on world top journal like Nature and Science. These innovative scientific findings make US universities/institutions very competitive in the world. If the OPT or OPT extension are cancelled, I dont think many international students will choose to come to US to do research, and this will definitely bring a terrible influence to the development of science and technology in US. Universities cannot find enough students to do important projects. Whats more, high-tech companies like biopharma companies cannot hire enough highly educated biological scientists to discovery new drugs. If the process of new drug discovery is slowed down because of this, that is really a disaster for US people and human being in the whole world.
