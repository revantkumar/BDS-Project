I strongly support the new OPT extension rule. The USA needs a large number of foreign students, especially those who are good at subjects such as maths. Foreign students compete with Americans in a fair position. It doesnt harm their benefits too much. If Americans are easily beaten in these areas, it proves that Americans are not appropriate for those jobs.
