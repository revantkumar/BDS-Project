I graduated from Gerogia Tech with a PhD degree in 2014.
And I find a job in Oracle with related filed of study right after graduation.
Unfortunately, no matter how hard I work in my job, I missed two chances of H1B lottery which means if I can not get it next year, I will be deported from US despite I have already spent five years here with along with the knowledge and work experience I accumulated here. I think this is a loss of my time and a loss of USA's investments on its research and development.
