I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. It is unjust, shortsighted and against the interest of American people to deprive international students' legal right to work in US after graduation and let them keep making contributions to this country simply because they are not citizens.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S, that's also the reason why I love to come to America to study.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing.Competition will help America to have more out-standing talents because among competitors, people will strive to improve themselves and the average level will automatically be lifted. 

In conclusion, I am strongly convinced that allowing international students to contribute in the US would bring in far more advantages than by driving them out.
