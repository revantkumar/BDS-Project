I strongly support this extension. International STEM students come to U.S because we have the chance to practice our expertise after graduation under OPT. IT companies in U.S are now fast growing and need a lot of technology professionals to support this growing. Longer OPT duration can attract more outstanding students from all around the world to study STEM majors in U.S, thus satisfies the need. 
Besides, international students play a big role in the economics in U.S. I'm a international STEM student in Boston. The living cost is roughly 24k per year, not including the expense on gift or other entertainment. If the number of international students in a university is about 5000 and there are 100 colleges in Boston, then we spend around 12 Billion a year in Boston. It's a great amount of money and it's just about the expense of those international students in college.
