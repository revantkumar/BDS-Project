In computer science industry, United State is in the leader position in all of the world. And it help the whole nation to stand as the strongest country. We should be thankful to the immigration rule that allow foreign students, engineers to commit their professional knowledge in IT industry. If United State lose these elites, it is possible that other country, such as China, India, would take over the leader position in IT industry. We can't take this risk to let this happen. So I sincerely hope STEM degrees could have OPT extension as long as possible.
