The STEM extension is pretty good and essential. But the comments are biased in my view. Many negative comments may come from people who are unemployed and are waiting at home (jobless). They are very unqualified to find a job themselves so are hoping the help from gov. Please wake up and think what could make this country better. The retaining of STEM talents is important if US still wants to be the most powerful country.
