Yizhe Zhang I am strongly convinced that this proposal is beneficial to both U.S. citizens and foreign student. The student pursuing higher education in U.S. are among the best of each Country. Considering the fact that many foreign students who have gain excellent training through U.S. higher education, supported by U.S. fellowships and education funding, there is NO reason to exclude them when they are ready to make contribution. Especially, when the choice is made by rolling a dice. Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010, according to the Partnership For A New American Economy (http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf). These indicates that the foreigner are playing very pivot role in U.S. 
International student didn't gain the job by earning a low salary, instead they are mostly employed in high-end technology company. The society and economy might experiencing a recession if the incorporations and startups have to less qualified people.
