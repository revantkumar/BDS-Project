As a professor in UCLA materials science department, I feel that I have a few word to say here.
I have many excellent doctoral students and they are all international students. They are really versatile in scientific research and they all have no fewer than ten publications on best journals in materials science and engineering. I believe that they are competent in US job market and academic area and what they need is just some more training outside academic research so that they can show their talent in industries. This is what OPT is meant for, right? 
I don't understand why so many Americans oppose this policy. All the American students in my group can easily get a job even before they graduate because of their citizenship. So if you are American engineer, do not worry about international students. If you already have citizenship however still cannot compete with international students, you may have to improve your own skills instead of driving true talented people away. You will never find a job if you are not competitive, anyway.
