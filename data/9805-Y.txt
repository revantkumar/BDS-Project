The proposed extension will largely enhance the US leadership in research and technology sectors.

The US has long been the leader in science and technology, and one of the main reason for the leadership is due to the the diversity workforce in the US research sector. The advancement in science technology often comes with exchange of ideas, and a diverse workforce in research and technology sectors historically significantly contributes to that. Many scientific research papers I have personally read and cited includes some degree of international collaboration; and many people I have professional relationship with comes from a different cultural background other than me. We all embrace the diversity, and agree this has been very beneficial to advancements in research. Also, many research projects take great lengths (usually above 18 months) to reach meaningful results. If the OPT extension plans were suspended, it will cause serious disruption in many schools and companies. Companies and organizations will have to find alternatives ways to finish its projects, and many projects may have to be canceled half-way. 

The world nowadays are more and more integrated and globalization is an inevitable trend. The US has been a leader in globalization, and it is unimaginable that we are reverting this trend ourselves and creating huge loss for thousands of US academies and employers. I strongly support this proposal to maintain the US leadership in research and technology.
