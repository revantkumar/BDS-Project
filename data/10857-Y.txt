I fully support this OPT extension. In engineering field, many F1 students are admitted by universities with scholarship which is usually provided by government's national institutes. These students obtain solid skills during their study in US. Since the US society has already invested money and time to train these students, they should provide their contribution to the society after their graduation. If they don't have the chance to stay here for a long time, they will go to other countries to serve them. It's then a serious waste because of the investment made. By approving this OPT extension, the society can get the substantial payback from these students.
