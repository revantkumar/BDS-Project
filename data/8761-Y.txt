Li Jiang Actually I strongly agree with expanding OPT because it helps the US to develop faster than before. F1 students enjoy best education resources in the US but they can't serve for this country just because they are not allowed to work here. In many universities, more than half students are nonimmigrant student and most of them just go back to their hometown. See the development speed in India and China? Suppose they all serve for the US, of course they will help the US a lot.
