The proposed regulation gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students over American workers. It also provides help to foreign students that is not available to American students. The proposed rule also runs counter to the original purpose of OPT which was to give foreign students more tools help their home countries when they return home. We say we want to help the citizens of poor countries yet we keep the very ones who can improve the conditions in their home countries. This is counter productive.

Today the US has a greater proportion of its workers out of the workforce than at any time including the great depression. Why is this? Could it be because we have the highest percentage of foreigners living and working in the US since we first became a country. Today American workers face discrimination in the workplace by employers because of policies promulgated by their own government and OMT is one such policy. American companies prefer these "students" because programs such as this make them cheaper to hire than American graduates with the the same or superior skills. Employers save as a minimum the employers share of payroll taxes, 7.65%, and probably the employees share, 7.65%, also when they hire these students" instead of Americans because they don't pay FICA or medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often receive pay in the $60,000 to $90,000 range thereby costing Social Security about $One Billion a year. As an American it makes no sense to work for a STEM degree when your own government discriminates against you in getting a job.

"Expanding de facto guest worker programs like Optional Practical Training (OPT)-through which employers hire more than 120,000 young graduates per year who hold F 1 degrees-chase Americans out of computer science" Richard Trumka, Pres. AFL-CIO
