Yucong Lin I admit that American education system generates a great number of domestic engineering students. But they do not fully satisfy the needs of US high-tech industry. Therefore, qualified international students should be hired and longer term of OPT should be given to them. US has been maintaining its leading role in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Maths for dozens of years by absorbing a considerable amount of international talents. Cancellation of opt extension will give internationals the wrong signal that US are not welcoming them any more. This will be detrimental for US high tech industries in the long term. 

Some comments mentioned that STEM international students will take the jobs of US citizens. However, to be frank, the types of jobs that international students in STEM will be considered is quite limited, They are usually the type of jobs that US students are not so interested because it takes a lot of efforts to finish the degree but it turns a job in the field is not so lucrative compared to a doctor or a lawyer. International students are not competing with US citizens, but they are more competing among themselves.

In summary, the extension of OPT will benefit the development of Science and Technology of US but will not threaten US citizens' job opportunities. Therefore, it should be approved.
