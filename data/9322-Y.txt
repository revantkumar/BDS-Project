I strongly support this rule, because this is a win-win strategy for both US and foreign students. Firstly, US tech companies rely on foreign students/workers to create values. Also, these companies pay a lot of tax to US. This huge amount of tax will benefit all citizens. For foreign students here, this is a good opportunity to utilize what they learned and gain more real-world industry.

After reviewing the comments that object to the proposed rule. Most of them are afraid that citizens will lose their job preferences when finding jobs. I disagree with this. I work in high tech industry. US tech companies definitely prefer US citizens over foreign students if they have the same skill set and capability because they can work here without any restrictions. Also, tech companies is risking potential loss of those foreign workers because of the H1B lottery system. So, why would they choose foreign employees if they could find qualified citizens? So, it is ridiculous to worry about losing job preferences as citizens. Just to improve your skills and make yourself qualified for your dream jobs! 

Good economy relies on great people. We want talents come here to contribute to US development. OPT-extension would be in the best interest of our nation.
