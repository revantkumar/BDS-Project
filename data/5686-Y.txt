David Lu Is it a dilemma as it seems? Actually, no. Those who are opposed to the new OPT expansion rule proposed by HSD are obviously not objective enough to ponder the situation how the whole country and its economy would be affected in the both short and long term future, if the expansion becomes invalid. It's definitely not an easy story to explain. But, if you know how intensively our industries have been eager to hire those STEM foreign students, how these excellent workers have been devotedly contributing this country, you will have to support the new HSD rule. Don't say those foreign students are not qualified or just equally qualified as native students. The fact is most of them have struggled through much more fierce competition to obtain the opportunity to study in our colleges, and the training opportunities to work in our companies. Most of them are among the best students in their original countries. They finally succeed in competing with rivals from different countries, including US. It is a strong statement that they could be better workers. I believe this is one of the main reasons why our industries want them to stay. For the same reason, for the better economics growth in our country, I have to support to give foreign students more opportunities to make contribution to us. Otherwise, we will not only lose such talented workers, also our colleges will lose more international students due to the less attraction if we don't allow them to stay long enough after graduation. It can be easily seen, without the considerable amount of financial support from these foreign students, our students will no doubt pay higher tuition to attend colleges. Obviously, HSD are trying to help our country positively in this way.
