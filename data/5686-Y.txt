I support OPT to be extended to 24 months because it is a more reasonable time frame to find a suitable job and get trained and gain experiences. It usually takes up to 3-4 month to get a job and then you go through 3 month probation period, which means international students do not have too much freedom to change a company even if they find the company is not right for them, becasue they will not have reasonable time to go through another hiring process and start working by this point.
