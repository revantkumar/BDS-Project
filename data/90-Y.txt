I strongly SUPPORT this proposal for the OPT extension. As an international student who learned mathematics, I know that many Americans do not like to learn math and US need these foreigners to work form them. Besides, those who thinks they can not find a job because of international students are just not competitive enough. Competition does exist, but it will help Americans to choose better person. And those who thinks U.S. companies hire foreign students to avoid paying payroll taxes are nonsense. They are paying taxes as Americans do. International students just want a training period to have some working experience. Why not give them such a chance?
