Feng Cui I Strongly support this 24 month extension proposal. Not only because I am an international student, but also I learned a lot from my college years in the US. 

It is very possible to contribute what I learned to bridging businesses between the US and my home country. If this 2 year proposal gets passed, I can have more time to found a company to do so.

So do not be hestate, I swear my new companies is going to create more job opportunities for US people.
