I strongly support this proposal. I think this proposal will only bring benefits for the United States with the following two reasons.
The first reason is that most of the technology companies in U.S. hire international students in STEM to work for them. The most important reason is that most U.S. citizens don't want to study and work in STEM area, so international students make up a large portion in STEM. Extending the OPT for STEM graduate students will not reduce the job opportunities for U.S. citizens as they will not seek for jobs in STEM area even if there are no international students in US. Without the extension in STEM, companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple and so on will lose many employers and I don't think they can recruit so many engineers and scientist from U.S. citizens. The leading positions of these companies will also be replaced soon by other companies with excellent students in STEM area. With the OPT extension policy, technology companies will keep developing and making profits.
The second reason is that the huge number of international students in U.S. strongly stimulates the economy in US. International students pay expensive tuitions and buy a lot of stuffs for everyday life. Their friends and family often come to U.S. for visiting, and this also stimulates the development in tourism and retailing. With the OPT extension in STEM, more and more international students will come to U.S. for study instead of other countries. If this extension was cancelled, international students will choose other countries, like Canada, United Kingdom or Australia. 
So I think the extension can only bring benefit
