Fiona Han I strongly support the rule for the following reasons:
1. Most people against this rule are afraid of the competition for citizen jobs landing. But if you were to think in the perspective of companies, STEM companies need people who are truly talented. If you're good, then you don't need to afraid of competition. The rule actually helps to rule out those students who aren't qualified. 
2. Whoever knows American knows that one of the American's core values is equality. For those vote against this rule: How could you say "NO" to a talented student who put in their hard work to be good doesn't deserve the equality?
3. Think in the long run: this rule would attract more talented students and incorporate more talents for US in STEM area. This really benefits the development of STEM fields.
4. Think for US: those F-1 students would do good for US economy.
