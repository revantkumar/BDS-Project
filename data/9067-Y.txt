I supporting this proposal because the following reasons

1. As the development of technology, more and more Hi-Tech company is lack of people who have technique skills or with science major, such as Math, science, CS. The demand for people like that way exceed the supply. Student who study those major will defiantly fill the blank of those supply, why should we give up the opportunity to accelerate the progress of economics.

2.Those people who are high-educated, can be consider as high quality of labor, and they have a much lower chance to be involved in criminal. it's a win-win situation, the U.S. will have enough high-educated labor, and those people can gain working experience in the most advanced country. 

3. More and more technology company will need student like that to help them develop the app, calculate risk, which is a trend for every business. If the supply can not catch up with the demand, the compensation company need to pay for those skilled people will be incredible high, I don't think any of the company wish that happen, even for those who want to start up their own business. 

I feel any smart people who do care about their country's future, will agree on this proposal.
