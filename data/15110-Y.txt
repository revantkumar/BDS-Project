I SUPPORT the proposal profoundly for the following reasons:

1. The international students accept high level education in the U.S., so it's rational for them to do something beneficial to this nation. They should return this country in this form. "The favour of drop water, should emerge fontal look signs up for", this is unquestionable.

2. As we all know, the U.S. is a diverse country, it is important to keep inclusive in U.S. life, people can learn from others' strong points and close the gap, it is definitely a good thing for all the people.

3. I have to admit that competition between natives and international students does exist, but in my opinion it is a good thing. The competition pushes everyone to do their best, the competition is conductive to the development of the society and the country.

According to the above reasons, I strongly agreed to this proposal.
