Jason Song Come on! It is competition. If citizens are qualified on jobs related to STEM, those companies would hire them without hesitation instead of finding immigrants. 

BTW, STEM employers who are hard working in tech companies could generate huge amounts TAX (more than you contributes). And those TAX might benefit on all USA citizens. They may contribute one dollar while yours is close to one penny. Their contributed TAX could already spend for your children your home.
