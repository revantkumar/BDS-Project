International students contribute a lot to American's economy and the diversity of culture. The 24 month extension of OPT STEM will give these talented and capable international students more opportunities to play their effective roles in America. Approving this 24 months OPT STEM will definitely be a wise decision, otherwise, it will be a great loss to the USA. Please keep open minded and don't limit your mind to the worry of immigration.
