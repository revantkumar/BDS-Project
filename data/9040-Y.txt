Yuan Lu I read this policy carefully and strongly support it. 

1. Every year, lots of foreign students come to America. They bring America tuitions and help to generate plenty of jobs. Most of them want to find a job here. If we cancel the OPT extension,we will lose many foreign students because it is pretty hard for them to find jobs here. This will cause a huge damage to America economy. Since they have brought huge benefit to America economy, it is our responsibility to give them more benefits in finding jobs.

2. This is only for STEM students!!! Please see the fact that industry world has a huge need for STEM students, because Americans do not like to do these jobs. Extension OPT can help to solve this issue. Now tens of thousands of foreign STEM students are working in OPT. If we cancel OPT extension, many of them must leave next year !!!! Do we have enough U.S workers meet the requirement of industry???

3. In the policy, it is clearly noted that there is safeguards for U.S workers. That is to say, no foreign students can grab one American's working opportunity. No one will hire a foreigner if he can find a local employee do the same thing. We can keep U.S workers enough working opportunities and, at the same time, provide foreigners jobs that Americans cannot or do not like to do. This is really a policy benefit for both Americans and foreigners.
