I strongly support this OPT extension regulation. The US economy will definitely benefit a lot from this regulation in multiple different ways. 

First of all, Most F-1 Nonimmigrant students with STEM Degrees own skills and competence that are desired by most high tech companies in US, who are the main force to boost the US economy. 

Secondly, This regulation will attract more talented students from all over the world to study in US colleges, which will definitely stimulate consumption. 

Thirdly, this regulation will improve the diversity of working force in US, which in the long term will no doubt help improve the US economy structure, making sure that US economy is always taking the lead in the world.
