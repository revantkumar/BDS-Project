I do support the proposal for the new 24 month-extension of STEM OPT. 

First and foremost, the great educational resources and good job/intern opportunities are the main factors attracting great students around the world. These students are also great economy contributors to this country while completing their degrees. Moreover, those international students are also continuingly making great contributions after their graduation. Many of them also joined many startups which increase a great deal of job positions for the local people. Without such opportunities for those international students, I don't think the number of international students will stay the same in future. In other words, this country will definitely lose a great number of its own economy contributors.

Furthermore, some people fear that international students will make the job competition more fierce in the future. However, I do believe that it is the competition that makes this country prosperous as she is today. Competition is the key reason that makes an elite a elite. We can never lock ourselves up just because of the competition. This is the worldwide trend. We have to alert our children and help them to be more competitive in the future. Only in this way can our children learn how to work hard and enjoy the happiness that they fight for.

Finally, I think some people who quote the so-called "protection for citizens" are just making nonsense. I believe this is the biggest fight against American US born citizens! As mentioned above, without a good environment, the leadering role of our IT industry can no longer maintained. In other words, lots of people will definitely lose their jobs in the future! As we all know, IT industry is and will continuingly be the most important factor that makes a great country in this century. This era needs those talents. Like China, India, and other countries, they are also making efforts to attract these talented people back, even Americans.
