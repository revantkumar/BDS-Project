I am a hard-working technology professional working in Los Angeles area and am currently on first 12 months of OPT. I pay taxes and also make a significant contribution to the American economy through my job. I got this job on merit and I believe in American system. OPT 24 months extension is not only important for professionals like me but also for America as it will help this nation to continue to remain great and front-runner in new technological advancements. 
In this fast growing world that is heavily dependent on technology, we should aim to be more global and accepting of each other's culture. America has to lead the way towards this philosophy as it was founded on these principles.
