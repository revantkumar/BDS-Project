I am strongly for the proposed rule.
STEM engineers are here by merit. Through entrance exams. They are here because American Universities are some of the best in the world.
American companies seek highly talented engineers to compete with the global market. The Government spends a lot of money on education to have a competent work force and cater to american companies. 
It would be counterintutive oppose the proposed rule.
