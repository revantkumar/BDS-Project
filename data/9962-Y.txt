For international STEM student,they are study their knowledge in a different language which has many difficult terminologies. If they can not use their knowledge in an English spoken country,then their knowledge might be useless.And America is a big innovative and technological country. It is a great land for them to develop their ability in their major.Or they will use their knowledge they have studied to do contribution for their own countries.In some way,this is also a good choice.And government has put their money for their graduation.In addition , they also put so much money to finish their education.They have helped to increase the economy for that city. I think that country will also give back something for their effort.So extension for opt is really a necessary thing.
