MM62 Sundaresan Jayaraman US needs a larger tech-savvy workforce to maximize economic growth
400,000 stem students from 200,000 by 2015 (Doubling of STEM graduates)
At rate of $200000.00 per student for 2 year degree with tuition and graduation fees, staying expenses and other education revenue the US is receiving ( Total $80000000000.00) will go other countries with OPT system. 
US Universities and colleges will be badly affected if the OPT Stem extension is not retained and expanded to 24 months.
Most of the US Universities and colleges will shutting their doors if the OPT extension is not given, because student will choose other countries for higher education 
Students will contribute to the growth of US Economy by paying the Taxes on their employment ( 3 Years x $3000 per year x 400000 students= Total $ 3600000000.00). 
Total Benefit to US Economy Benefit in the range of $ 83600000000 for 5 years
Students will contribute to the growth of US Economy by innovation and research in their field of study (Example Solar Energy, Medical Research)
Best practices from employers/industries can be reached to the Universities
Without practical training the education for 3 years will not prove to be beneficial to the students (Ex: mobile- android/iOS development)
Students acquire skills and specialized knowledge in their chosen studies ( Ex: Cancer Research, Stem Cell Research, Nano technology)
In developing countries the OPT is not available and that is why the students come to US.
The curriculum and syllabus of the various Universities are fast changing to changing technologies in STEM
The employers will be getting the top notch brains and new energy filled students who can bring benefit to the company by the new developments science and technology and IT ( Ex: BIG DATA in IT, Social Networking, Mobile technology) otherwise relying on obsolete technologies
The new rule proposed will help that it will not affect any US based existing employees as they are covered under the provisions of new rule protects their interests
The Industry and College co-ordination will get improved by the OPT program
STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.
Without practical training the education for 17 months will not prove to be beneficial to the students
Students will leave US, in the middle of their practical training with half-baked experience, if the OPT stem is not for a minimum of 3 years
It takes a total period of 4 years to master the field experience of stem ( like IT experience without 4 years of practical experience is not preferred by an employer).OPT Stem extension should be for 24 months
Welcome the new proposals (Formal Training Program and Customized Mentoring and Training Plan),which will benefit both employer and students. But this should not be a burden with lot of paper work and the procedure should be simplified by online submissions
The OPT Stem Extension Formal Training Program and Customized mentoring procedure and training rule should be simplified for the benefit of small employers as well and should reduce the unnecessary documentation work
Cap-Gap Relief is an Important Part of the 2008 Rule and should be retained
Welcome the new proposals and without this the students will leave the US and there will be brain drain and students will be losing the touch on the Stem degree advancements and experience 
It will make a dent in the student career and resume, if the Cap-Gap is Relief is not retained
Anyhow, if they are selected in H1b, they have to come back and work after 6 months. If this relief is there, it will avoid unnecessary travel and unnecessary lack of continuity in employment
There should be a new rule that all the OPT Students with stem extension should be given automatically given H1B visa after they complete the OPT extension to serve US with their talent
If US is changing the rule of Stem OPT Extension on temporary basis, then international students will find the other countries beneficial and hence this new rule should be a permanent one and should be implemented before the court deadline of 12 Feb 2016.
The new rule should be implemented by Jan 2016 (before the 12 Feb 2016) deadline by the court
This will reduce the uncertainty for the career of the student and they can focus on their work/training they are undergoing if the new rule is enacted in advance
The existing students with 17 months OPT stem extension should be given for 7 months additional extension automatically, without inviting any further extension application based on the new rule and new OPT card should be sent
