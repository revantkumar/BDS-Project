I will definitely support to expand OPT for foreign students. This policy will allow more intellectual foreign students to find a job in the field of science and technology in America, and therefore facilitate the growth of IT field and other science-related fields in the U.S. And this growth will in turn facilitate the development of job market in the U.S., helping more American people to find their job. In conclusion, this policy will definitely be beneficial to the U.S. economy.
