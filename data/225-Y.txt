To the venerable justices,

I'm an international student who has been serving this country for almost a year with OPT after I graduate from college. As most of the students who chose to stay and work in the US, the OPT give us the opportunities to utilize what have learned from the college. We appreciate that Country-of-Freedom provides us the options to contribute best of our life to its development.

However, my original OPT will be end at the February 2016. Without this OPT-Extension, I will be forced to move out of my current job, and stopping serving the country I like so much. 

Please think about the importance of OPT-Extension for continuously offering the world a message that the United States, the "Country-of-Freedom", are welcoming all talented people come to serving with the best part of them.

Thank you very much for your sincerely concern.

Sincerely,
Chen Fang
