I strongly support this rule. I am an international student who is working in a IT company as OPT status. If I don't have the OPT extension, I have to leave. Lots of colleagues have the same situation like me. IN our team, we are working on a project would last about 2-3 years. If most of the team member leaves, this project would break down, and it would have a really bad impact on the company. And from a broad view, most of the technical companies have same situations as my company. If most of the work force leaves, lots of companies would crash, which would really be a disaster to the economy.
