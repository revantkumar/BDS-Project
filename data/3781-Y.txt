The course of learning should incorporate both theoretical and empirical experiences. The U.S. Is known for its acedemic robustness, which in why students jump through hoops to come here - to receive high level education, followed by putting the things they learned to use. It is only logical for students to get the hands on experience in the environment that is most relatable to their studies within the U.S. OPT status gives graduates the opportunity to put knowledge into practice. Depending on the industry, the threshold of learning can take long periods of time to be met. Therefore, sufficient time to learn about applying their knowledge should be provided to graduates. The U.S. Government accepted students to study at universities, receiving a degree is only half of the curriculum, the other half comes from working, it does not make sense to close the door on students before the the education is completed in its entirety.
