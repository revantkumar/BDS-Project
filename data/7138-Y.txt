This is definitely a GREAT proposals and I strongly support it! Why would we educate foreign students with the most advanced technology on earth and then send them back to their own country to let them compete and beat down our own industry? This doesn't make any sense and benefit nothing but our competitors!!! US is strong because out tech industry is strong! Considering the fact that there is a great gap between demand and supply of tech worker within the pools of our own US citizens, keep those foreign STEM students here in our shore would definitely benefit our country!
