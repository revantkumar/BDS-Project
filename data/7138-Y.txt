Diane Carr International students are also helping to fill skills shortages at a time when the US share of the world's science and engineering graduates is declining. Our country has reached on top of the world because of the technology and because of this rule actually the whole world is contributing towards the technological growth of our country. STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy. Many jobs are going unfilled simply for lack of people with the right skill sets. Hiring international students does not mean stealing jobs from Americans. I personally did not see ANY American students with STEM degrees and decent GPAs get unemployed.
