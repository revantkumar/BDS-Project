I steadily support OPT extension. Like Jefferson said in the Declaration Of Independence, it is a American spirit that our country is a society guarantees freedom, equality and chances to pursuit happiness for all; that's the definition of America. Some people are arguing about "Salad Bowl or the Melting Pot" right now, but if we cut the possibility of becoming a better nation just because we are afraid of end up being "Salad Bowl", it will be a pity. On the contrary, I strongly recommend this young, energizing America to open up the extension, try something first, then I believe we will never regret even if we failed, cause at least we showed this world that we are brave enough to try and we actually tried.
