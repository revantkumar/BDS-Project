I strongly support the 24 month STEM extension. The opportunity provided through the STEM OPT is not one that has been snatched from an American citizen and provided to a foreign national , but one that provides equal job opportunities to all qualified students irrespective of their nationality. I feel this is something that must be encouraged as it would help both the individual and the nation to grow towards prosperity.
