Primarily, the reason that a lot international student come to US relies on the larger potential of gaining decent amount of practical working experience after graduation. With such a hope, they may stay here for couple of years, during which, they may create a huge amount of job opportunities for restaurants, hotels, transportation, real-state, car selling, and so on. If OPT extension is cancelled, what makes the difference from US to other competitive countries, such as England, Australia, Canada, etc. I think the only difference is the higher tuition fee in US. Without such benefit, the amount international students would drop dramatically, and above industries would suffer with it eventually. 

Think it this way, how many US citizens benefit from wave of international students, and how many's job are taken by those ?Optimistically , 1 of 20 can really make use of OPT extension by joining an E-verified company, which is the only type of company supporting OPT extension. let say they averagely stay US for 3 years, how may job opportunities those 20 students created in last 3 years ? It definitely much more than 1. I therefore can't give more support to OPT extension proposal.
