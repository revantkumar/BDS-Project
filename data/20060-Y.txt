I strongly support this rule because of the following reasons:

1.Most of the STEM students work at high tech companies which contribute a valued part of US GPD, not to mention many vacancies that require higher level education from STEM programs cannot be fully filled by citizens.

2.STEM students who work for US companies they not only make profits for the company but also play an important role in US economy as consumers, which lead to creating more job opportunities for local communities.

3.It looks ridiculous that we put so many resources to have a high level student well educated and let him or her go somewhere else to develop others' economy.

4.American dreams are not only for american citizens but also for those who have dreams.

Thanks.
