Xing Liang I do support the extension of OPT to 24 months for STEM students. First of all, I think the extension of OPT would make more opportunities for international students to pay back to America. If they get a job in US, they will pay their taxes, devote themselves in helping their company increase its financial income and in return, the company could recruit more people including US citizens. It is obvious that the extension of OPT would make positive influences in increasing the employment rate. Secondly, the extension of OPT could reduce the recruiting cost for the companies and also reduce the time wasted in dealing with paper works. Actually, many small companies cannot bear the cost of applying H1B right now and hence lose many valuable human resources. If the OPT could be extended, many international student can work with OPT visa and small companies could save a lot money and earn more valuable human resources to devote more economic contributions to US. 

So, from the above two reasons, I am very hopeful for the positive result of extending OPT time and do support this policy.

Best
