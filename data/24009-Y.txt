I am in fully support to this new rule. I disagree with some comments that this will take away American taxpayers' work opportunities.

STEM is an area where lots of top-quality talents are needed. US citizens only cannot fully satisfy this huge amount of needs. STEM simply gives high-tech companies chances to hire enough hi-tech workers from all over the world. The argument made by some people that Americans will lose their work opportunities because of the new OPT STEM rule just cannot hold true. Their argument is equivalent of saying that US citizens cannot provide enough hi-tech workers, and need to let people with lower-quality skills to work by forbiding international talents. This is so short-sighted. A country without strong scientific and economy development will soon lose its advantages, which is the key for US to be the strongest country in the world. Without the first place in the world, how can US keeps providing enough job opportunities on the market? STEM rules allows a continuous, vivid job market. Certain degrees of competition is not a bad thing. US citizens with hi-tech skills will not suffer from this rule, and people without high-tech skills now have more reasons and motivation to improve their skills to help their own country, rather than dragging its leg and slowing it down.

Another important point is, F1 students benefited from OPT STEM also pay a lot of taxes. For those have stayed in the US for more than 4 years (which is generally true, as schools take 2-4 years already), they need to pay more taxes as they became residential. As they are US taxpayers, the government should also consider their benefits. Besides, the economy contribution they gonna bring to the country is far more significant than the tax differences between them and US citizens.

All in all, I support the new OPT STEM rule and look forward to seeing it becomes effective before Feb 2016.
