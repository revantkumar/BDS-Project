Chau Nguyen Please also consider opportunities for Accounting major students that wants to work for Big Four (EY, Deloitte, PwC, and KPMG) in North America. I absolutely understand why non-STEM major do not have a privilege compares to the STEM ones. Big Four firms recruit a lot and always at the top for company that apply H1B visas for employees; and giving accounting major students a chance means a lot to us international students.
