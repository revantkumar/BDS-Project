Harris Lu As an Engineer working at the IT industry, I would like to comment on the STEM OPT Extension.

Each year there will be intelligent international students who holds a master or PhD degree in Computer Science joining our company. These guys not only showed proficient skills when doing projects but also a responsibility to get the job done on time. I am very glad to work with these talents. They are always eager to give me hand whenever I met a problem. The 24-month STEM OPT will definitely help the U.S. to retain those talents who hold an advanced degree in STEM and make them fuel our technology and economy. 

It is known to us that emerging powers like China, Japan, Russia, Germany etc. have already been competing with the U.S. in both economy and technology. Those nations will be glad to bring the talented masters and PhDs back home and fuel their own economy if the STEM OPT gets abolished. The U.S. spent a lot of time and money in bringing the world-top German scientists to our nation after the World War II to boost our technology but now some of the short-sighted minds should force the talents back to home! 

Although there might be cases that OPT might be abused, but we can take measures to clarify which major and which university qualify for STEM OPT instead of a "accredited university", which is too vague. Simply putting an end to STEM OPT is not a good choice.

For the above reasons, I would like to support the STEM OPT and I would also like to find measures to be taken to prevent the STEM OPT from being abused.
