Ge Hu I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
First, the government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S..
Second, diversity is indispensible for U.S., foreign students can dedicate to U.S. in the future only if you gave them chances.
Third, the competition makes progress. We should allow competition happen. We cannot restrict competition in order to find regression in finance. Competition makes U.S. more competitive, isn't it a good thing for U.S.' development?
