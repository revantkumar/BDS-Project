Xiaoping Zhou I support this rule to be approved, given there is no hope to fix the broken H1B system in a short term.

The chance for a foreign graduate to get H1B visa is very low in recent days due to the abusive behavior of a few large outsourcing companies. See: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/us/large-companies-game-h-1b-visa-program-leaving-smaller-ones-in-the-cold.html?_r=0

This rule has to be approved for maintaining the continuity of US economy. Why? 

(1) From employer's perspective: If I know a student can only work for me over one year, and I know that he/she is unlikely to get a H-1B visa (given the significantly low chance due to the flood petitions by the large outsourcing companies), I am not going to hire any such student. This will make all the existing one-year OPT meaningless. Furthermore, if I know these bright graduates have to leave US, I am going to outsource the jobs overseas and thinking about relocating my company site out of US.
-- This would lead to significant exodus of high tech companies away from US, thus significantly hurt the competitiveness of US economy.

(2) From students' perspective: If I know that US is not going to offer any STEM OPT and US employers are unlikely to hire any OPT students due to the difficulty of obtaining H-1B visa, I would reconsider the choice of pursuing study in US.
-- This would result in a loss of tuition income and related income generated by foreign students, and also loss of potential talents that would add to innovation and energy to US economy.

Therefore, this rule NEEDs to be approved to maintain the countinuity of US economy BEFORE a fix of the H-1B system can be done.
