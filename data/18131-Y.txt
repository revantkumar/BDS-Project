I got a green card as part of the E11 program. This is available to any well qualified graduate of outstanding ability. This is the only kind of graduate student the US needs. The others have mediocre qualifications and contribute little that US graduates do, except for lowering salaries. The IEEE and other professional bodies have campaigned against the H1B cap and this program is a work around H1B fix typical of this dishionest administration. If there really was a STEM shortage STEM salaries would be higher but they aren't.

Don't listen to the foreign students who have flooded the comments section here. They are not American citizens or legal residents and their opinions should not count as much. Every country has a duty to put its citizens first.
