Jiaqi Zhai As an international student, I strongly SUPPORT this proposal for the following reasons:
1. U.S. is an immigration country that embraces diversity. All international students should be allowed to make contribution to the US after they graduating from US schools, especially students who study in STEM majors.
2. I don't think extend OPT for nonimmigrant STEM students will block American students. However, I believe the competition will encourage all students who want to work in the US. In other words, students will study hard than before and that will lead to high quality performance in their profession industries.
