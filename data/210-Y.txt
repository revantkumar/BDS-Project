I strongly support this rule. I believe the reason why US is such a great country lies in its openness to talents from all around the world. We attracts the best people from around the world to serve this country. We had attracted great peoples like Albert Einstein and Nikola Tesla etc. who did great job for America. I belive STEM OPT will greatly help this country and eventually benefit every one.
