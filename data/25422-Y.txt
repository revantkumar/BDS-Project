I strongly support this proposal. As long as the students on OPT is making a positive impact on the country. Those people who cried that these international students are stealing their jobs are so short sighted. High quality of candidate market definitely helps U.S. keep the leadership role in the world. If the U.S. government started to protect those people who is not strong enough to compete with their international job seekers, the industry will lose it's vitality in the long run.
