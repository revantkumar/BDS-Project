I strongly support this proposal for extended OPT time. Many of those negative comments really cannot stand to my point of view.

Allowing foreign students does not mean using low wages and prevent Americans from working. Those students with advanced STEM degree in fact most will work on high technology related jobs where those companies can not find enough U.S. works for the job. You can not blame those students for the highly increased IT technology. 

There is no shortage of US students in STEM: quantity does not equal to quality. In fact, only a small proportion of them can pass the strict interviews and finally get a job by US companies.

Therefore, this new proposal is reasonable and much needed.
