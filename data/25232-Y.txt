Compared to Non-Stem majors, international students in STEM major usually have weakness in communication skills and social networking, which are highly desired in job searching activities. So longer OPT allows additional time for them to adjust and accommodate themselves in order to find suitable jobs and devote their time and effort to the society. Therefore I agree to extend opt and the core idea is to make contributions the the whole society by using what we have learned: the technology and skills!
