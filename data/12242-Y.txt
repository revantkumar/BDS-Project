I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:

1. Many American companies now lacking skilled and proficient workers, and American workers are not adequate in both quantity and quality. Foreign STEM students play a vital role in many industrial and high-tech companies.
2. An extended OPT will be a great attraction to potential foreign students, whose investment is an important support to the educational business, especially to some universities.
3. Historically, America is a country of immigrants, and its key spirit stands that everyone should have equal chance, and one can gain his future by personal effort. Certainly, according to this, foreign STEM students should be given an opportunity to compete and obtain a job through their professional skills.
