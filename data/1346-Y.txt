I strongly support this proposal. This OPT extension rule will benefit both the U.S. technology and the F-1 non-immigrant students because of the following three reasons:

1.Longer STEM OPT will attack more talented STEM student come to U.S. to study STEM major, this will create revenue and tax income for the education segment. 

2.Most companies spend at less 3 to 4 months to train the new employee. Because of the nature of complex work STEM students are facing, IT companies or high technology companies will definitely spend more than 4 months (sometimes 1 year) to train their new employees and let their employees to get familiarized with their job and the system the company is using. Without this rule, companies have to let their talents go after one year. Moreover, Company have to find new replacement after one year. This will be a huge turnover for those E-verify companies that hire international students. Also for F-1 STEM major student one year is not enough to help them finish their on job training and get to know the industry or their career path. America is a country that promotes equal opportunity. STEM students deserve a longer training period to have equal opportunities to learn and train.

3.Improving and expanding OPT for F-1 Students with STEM Degrees will not affect no STEM major students and U.S. citizens employment rate because STEM students are studying very narrow subjects and facing very limited job positions. It will not affect any no STEM major student or U.S. citizens to find a job.
