Juilee P I would welcome this rule, as an International student. 24 month extension would be beneficial for both the Employee as well as Employer. From the student's perspective, it gives him more time to practically learn on job as well as apply his or her skills, learned during college. 
Being on a student visa, international students are already at somewhat of a disadvantage in the extremely competitive market, and only the top students are picked up by companies. I feel that this rule would be an asset for those hardworking and capable students, who want to make use of the knowledge they learn during their Post Graduate degree. 

This would also be another way of encouraging International students to attend US universities in larger numbers (which will ultimately benefit the US economy).
From the Employer's point, its better as they can have a long-tern commitment from their employee without having to worry about finding a new person for an on-going project.
