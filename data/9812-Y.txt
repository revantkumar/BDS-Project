Zibai Liu Highly Support this rule. 

I am currently employed by a Semiconductor company. Based on my experience, it usually takes several months to hire a new graduate from school. Then training time requires to be 3 to 6 months before this new-hire is ready to take responsibility for specific projects. Plus,each project would take 6 to 12 months even 24 month from the beginning to final closure. It is a big resource loss to the group and this U.S. company if this new hire has to quit due to immigration status problem. 

Expanding the OPT period and Cap-Gap length is obviously beneficial to F-1 nonimmigrant students, but also beneficial to U.S. companies even U.S. economy in long-term aspect. 

Moreover,the opportunity of working in the U.S. after graduation is always part of the reasons why many international students choose to study in the U.S. instead of other countries, as U.K. etc.Boost to local economy due to college in town is well-known. Besides, research projects need contributions of those brilliant kids all over the world. Is it really wise to lose those talented young people? 

All in all, in my opinion,it is significant to ensure the approval of this proposal considering those multi-fields advantages to the U.S.
