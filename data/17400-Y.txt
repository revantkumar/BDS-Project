I support this Optional Practical Training rule. Those who have OPT are students, who will become the new blood of American companies to increase their competence. The whole world is on the trade of increasingly strong connection among countries, including products, market and employees. Facing the fact that current CEO of both Google and Microsoft used to be international students, saying no to this rue will only leave the country behind this trade.

In addition, the longer the non US citizens stay US, the deeper they will immerse themselves into the American culture. For the new comers, what a grate country should do, is not saying "NO" to them, but accepting them and turning them into one of us with our culture.
