Graduates without jobs and your bringing in non citizens for employment. Much like the Geico commercial about people in horror films making bad decisions, are you crazy? Are you intentionally trying to depress wages and jobs for citizens? We the people, pay your salaries! Better get more in tune with the citizens for when we get Donald Trump in place, you will hear some unpleasant words, "your fired".
