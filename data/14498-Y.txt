Hi Sir/Madam,
Thank you for taking time reviewing my comment.
I am standing at a supportive role of this new rule.
I just want to emphasis one important fact that student who is using OPT-extension to work requires the employers to enrolled in the E-verify program which is a proof of that the employers are open and inclusive to the immigrants.
The reason why employer needs immigrants is because its hard for them to find sufficient high skills labors from US citizens, so there is no concerns that immigrant may take some of the job opportunities from majority part of US citizens. On the other hand, if a US citizen has sufficient skills to get the work done, he will definitely be more competitive than an international student since they have VISA issue.
In a word, it is nonsense that immigrant will cause crisis of the US job market. On the contrary, they are filling the gap of the high skilled labor market.
