The greater opportunity to work in USA is the advantage of studying in USA over in other countries, such as England and France. The international students, especially those in STEM subjects, are quite competitive in the market. USA is currently developing smart manufacture technologies, smart electric grids, green building and intelligent transportation system, etc. All these areas call for a great amount of young professional and engineers. It is wise for USA to extend the OPT to make these young students devote their most productive time to serve USA. If they are attracted by other nations, such as China, India or German, the USAs world leadership might be challenged.
It is a great loss for USA. 

Also, I do not see they will take the jobs away from the Americans, as the limited number of American young engineering students is insufficient to satisfy the huge need of the STEM market. Rather, USA needs those international students urgently for technological development.

In the middle of last century, Hsue-Shen Tsien in CIT left USA to work for red China, and soon the world witnessed the rapid development of China in rocket and missile technologies. Obviously this kind of story should have not happened, and USA should not make the wrong decision today and then regret again in the future.
