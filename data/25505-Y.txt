I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons. As foreign students, we already learnt plenty of good knowledge from the US college. We desperately want to use the skill and knowledge we learned in the US. Besides we will be part of the diversity in the US. Lastly, competition does exist but it is not a bad thing. It will bring more and more talents to the market and therefore generate more tax revenue, which is good for the US economy.
