Peter YANG I fully support the new proposed rule that extends the current 17 month OPT to 24 months. 

I cannot speak for everybody but i can state couple of facts about myself. 

1. About salary: Some people say foreign workers receive a lower wage to get employed. I earn a salary between $70,000 to $ 80,000 a year as a Business analyst. The average salary of a business analyst is around $50,000 per year. So as a new graduate, at lease in my case, i don't get employed because of lower salary. 

2. About jobs: As the U.S economy is recovering and growing, there has been an increasing demand (released by U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics) for skills in the STEM field for companies small and big. If the OPT extension is cancelled, then there will be shortages of people with mathematical skills, computer science and engineering backgrounds. As a result of shortage of talents, the growth of those companies will hurt domestically and lose competitiveness internationally in the long run as other countries are catching up by attracting talents and advancing their academic researches and study.
Meanwhile, i spend most of my earning on grocery, transportation, shopping, renting, health and car insurance and of course state and federal taxes. These consumption also in turn helps create job opportunities.

3. It has been and will always be the fact that if a country wants to develop its education, economy, science and culture, it welcomes people who can contribute in those areas, which U.S has been doing since the founding of this nation and hopefully will do the same in the future.
