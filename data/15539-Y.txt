I believe this rule will enable the United States to retain the highly educated talent. While many countries are complaining about brain drain, this is the right opportunity for the US of A to acquire as many brilliant people as possible. Smart people end up creating more jobs as a result of growth of companies and also in some cases creation of companies. I think this rule will benefit all in the long run.
