It is mutually beneficial for both US companies and international students to extend the OPT-extension period. US citizens and permanent residents have no reason to worry about losing jobs to foreign students if they have experienced the barrier the international students have encountered when they are looking for a job. US companies will try everything to avoid hiring international students unless they really couldn't find same qualified candidates. Given the chances to win the H1-B lottery are decreasing each year, it will be beneficial for both companies and international students to have one more chance to win the lottery. Otherwise, companies will need to replace someone they already trained well immediately and international students will be forced to leave the country.
