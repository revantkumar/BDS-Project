Having OPT will make US universities attract a lot of top students from other countries. These top students can make significant contributions to the development of US during their study and work in this country. 

If OPT is gone, then many top students will have other choices other than US, like Britain, Germany, France, and many other developed western countries. 

In order to make US attractive to talented people around the globe, the OPT should definitely be extended!
