I support the proposed regulations.

The new 24-month extension rule correctly acknowledges the complexity in getting proper training in STEM field. The updated Cap-Gap rule allows the US companies to make better hiring decisions and help the company in STEM field remain competitive.

All this has been proposed in the framework of increased oversight and the effort to guarantee that the students under OPT are treated fairly and not allowing companies to sacrifice job opportunities for American people.
