I don't think the idea of extending OPT for STEM college students harms the employment of U.S citizens. Companies offer jobs for competitive applicants and ONLY outstanding STEM students stay in the U.S. If the STEM student is not competitive, no matter how long the OPT is, he or she has to go back. Competition is not a bad thing. More elites among STEM students can stay and make contributions to the nation.
