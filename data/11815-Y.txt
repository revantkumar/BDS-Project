I strongly support the 24 month extension proposal to improve and expand training opportunities for F1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degree. This is critical for US high tech companies such as Microsoft and Google, which urgently need lots graduates with a STEM degree. However, it has become more and more difficult for these companies, as the number of H1B visa offered by US government is much smaller than the number of applicants. The 24 month extension will improve this situation and help US economy.
