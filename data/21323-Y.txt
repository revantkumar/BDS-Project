This nation was built by immigrants and this new legislation is not aiming to make it easier for foreign students to emigrate to the US, it is only giving the student a better chance at getting a work permit in the lottery.

Each foreign student spends an average of $100,000 during his time as a student. They also participate in cutting edge research which ensures the US remains a leader in technology. The proposed extension will only give the student a better chance of repaying his loans so that he has a chance of leaving the US after the STEM extensions loan free.

I don't see how this affects the local workforce in anyway and I think creates an incentive for students to come to the US without reducing opportunities for the local workforce.
