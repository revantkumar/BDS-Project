The spirit of America is to incorporate more talents from all over the world, isn't it? Without them, we won't see today's USA as a super power. So we need to improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees. Why not let these talents in? Come on! They are supporting our GDP with the technology and science that they have learnt at school. No discrimination! These international students made a great contribution to our economy! We need them! Our country needs them! We must support them!
