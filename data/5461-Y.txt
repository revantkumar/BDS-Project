Flora Woodbury Why not EXTEND OPT? 

1. STEM students are doing jobs that many citizens do not wanna do or are not interested in. They never rob jobs! 

2. Many Nobel winners are STEM students before. To accelerate the development of science, USA needs to open its door and share resources with all students. 

3. Most citizens are interested in non-STEM areas. Therefore, STEM students will not compete non-STEM jobs with them.
