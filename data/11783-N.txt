These "regulations" are why American citizens don't trust the government! We don't even know what's going on with OUR government.

I hold a degree in Information Technology and I am a veteran. I can't find a job. Even when you do it is a temporary job. We spend a lot of money on education and can't find jobs to pay back student loans.
