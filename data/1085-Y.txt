I strongly support this new OPT rule. Each year there are lots of well-educated, knowledgeable foreign students forced to leave the States, or fear of losing job and leave the States, due to no luck of getting H1B cap. It's a lose-for-all situation for the students, the employers who recruit them, the universities who educated them, and the community where they would settle down if they can maintain their legal status.

For the students who cannot get H1B during the OPT period, they cannot be guaranteed that they can settle in the States so that they would save the dollars earned in US for the unsure future. If they are forced to leave they won't leave the money behind them, that's a loss for also the community where they would spend money and pay tax. We already see examples in San Francisco that tech boom is reviving long-struggling Mid-Market area, lowering crime rate, driving away drug dealers there. If more and more students can settle down we can see similar improvements all across the country.

For the companies which hire those students, they will lose talents and will be forced to spend more money on recruiting and bear financial loss as they may lack labor force. If more and more such students are forced to leave States it will harm the competitiveness of US companies, and in turn harm the rebounding US economy. Tech giants like Google, Facebook, Twitter hired more staff than OPT based staff, yet pay significant amount of tax. Without this OPT rule their ability to grow and maintain competitive will be greatly harmed.

It will be a great beneficial to all people if this new rule take into effect!
