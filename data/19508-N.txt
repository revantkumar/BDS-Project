(ICEB) Proposed Ruleto expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. 
The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years.
We have 20 million Americans out of WORK ! 
Also WRONG that it will allow employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. 
STOP the GREEDY business owners that are destroying the JOB MARKET at the expense of American workers !
