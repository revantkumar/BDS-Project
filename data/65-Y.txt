That is unfair and shortsighted to deprive international students' legal right to work in US after graduation simply because they are not citizens and because some citizens said this action against their interests in America. If those citizens are really competitive, why can't they beat the international students in the position competition? Because they ask for high salary and they don't really work effectively, which will lead the fall of a whole company or a whole industry.
And for the international students, they will go back to their homeland and it is not the reason that they deprived the rights of the citizens.
