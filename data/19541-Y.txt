I don't think OPT Extension will cause bad effect to American job market, in fact, it's a great thing that can improve our abilities with competitions. Cause those Chinese students, Indian students are really smart, and they are good at coding so I don't have to worry about that when doing projects with them since I really hate coding! And I don't see the possibility that they would hurt our economy b/c they are rich, especially Chinese students, they love to buy luxury goods. I think I'll support this proposal.
