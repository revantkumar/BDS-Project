Dear Mr. Johnson:

I write to you regarding the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students.

I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of and extended OPT period of STEM majors. I'm particularly exited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in the proposed rule.

Best Regards,
