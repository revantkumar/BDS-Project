I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical 
Training Program. The expansion would allow companies to hire foreign student up to 3 yrs. avoiding their
share of payroll taxes. Honestly, we need to hire US citizens to help our economy grow. Our recent and qualified
college grad struggling to find work US companies should not receive an incentive to hire foreigners when they
should hire Americans. It's what's best for the US and our economy.
