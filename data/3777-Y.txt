Jian Yang I have been waiting for a longer OPT extension for a very long time!

Right now, H1b policy in US is almost broken. It has caused tremendous damage to both students who are seeking jobs and companies which are looking for talents. OPT extension is a very nice work around for the H1b policy. 

High demand in IT industry will not solve the unemployment problem for most US citizens. By bringing more international students to the IT industry, it will boost the needs for other business. This is exactly what the society needs to solve the unemployment problem.

Making the OPT extension longer is a very good baby step to make the job market better. We should consider making the extension even longer in the long run.
