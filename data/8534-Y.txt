I strongly support to extend STEM OPT program.

Why America is still the greatest nation in the world? The diversity. Anyone can come here and completely reinvent themselves. This is still the land of opportunity: there are few restrictions and almost unlimited possibilities. The U.S. consists of immigrants from the old and most of them made a huge contribution to the U.S. which why American developed so rapid and strong after the war. The STEM OPT extension rule is right to keep these American future elites. OPT extension gives international students more opportunities to achieve their "American dreams", thus it will attract more and more international students come to here, international students pay much more tuition than native students, this is a very big extra income for American education.
