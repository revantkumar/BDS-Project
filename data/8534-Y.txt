Lewis Liu This new rule is great! As a fresh new grad student looking for job now, I have to say it is really important for international students to get the job and work with OPT extension after graduation! Our international employees always work hard and make contribution to high tech industry in the the United States, the companies also are willing to hire international students since we are more competitive and productive. Moreover, we do no harm to native job seekers since the market is huge enough and even within current situation the high tech positions in many companies is still in demand and a lot of opportunities are always stay there. So giving international workers more time to continue their career is beneficial for both national economy and employees themselves.
