It is freedom and equality that make AMERICA what it is today. As to those who claimed that jobs opportunities should be reserved only for Americans, I want to say, your grandparents worked so hard to immigrate to America because they want you to live in a great, open minded country with equality and prosperity, instead of the one that will discriminate foreigners and keep pushing out hard working and loyal employees!
