I strongly advocate the extension of OPT.
1.It will attract more talented people and specialists. When comparing US with other countries such as UK, as a student applying for degree program, OPT policy is definitely an attraction. While US government is considering whether to extend OPT period, other countries like Singapore, New Zealand have already offered beneficial policies to retain specialists serving their countries.
2.US is a melting pot and it is a tradition that people from different areas work and live there. Some US citizens oppose against this rule that they are supposed to have more privilege during job hunting simply because they pay taxes. However, the government cannot neglect that there are a large number of international students who work for American company without civilian civil welfare.
3.US citizens should not blame their unemployment to this rule because companies always hire talented people not considering racial, gender and other biographical factors.
US government should always bear in mind how many fortune those international workers made to this country.
