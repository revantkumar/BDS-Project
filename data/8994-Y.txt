I strongly support the OPT extension proposal.

These STEM students are contributing what the nation needs most to the country, and I believe that is the reason why we are setting up the term "STEM" from very beginning. To maintain the STEM related principles' competence around the world, US should try to attract these high-level talents to stay, not to push them out. And the legal status of staying and working in the country is the basis.

We setup STEM because the nation needs large volume of talents in these fields, and the US citizens only are far from enough to fill up all these needs, which is a really unnecessary lose-lose choice. If US is open enough to attract these high-level talents to stay, it is clearly a win-win choice.
