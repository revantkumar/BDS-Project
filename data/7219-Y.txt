Anonymous I feel that this rule will benefit the US government, companies and F-1 students as well. It is a win-win situation for all. Companies can benefit from the knowledge and work of F-1 students. Students graduating with a degree in STEM course can bring in lot of talent and energy to work. I am sure that the Recruiting teams at the US based companies are good enough to recruit right talents. It is not true to say that F-1 students are taking up US citizens jobs. I feel that it is up to companies to decide what is best for them. Unable to expand training opportunities to F-1 students will make them leave their jobs and return to their home country, there by forcing the companies to loose talented employees. I also feel that not providing good opportunities to F-1 students might result in lowering the international student admission rate in colleges. This will have a great impact on the School as well as Government economy. Also, F-1 students working for US based companies will only make the companies grow better. It does not have a negative affect on them or the economy. Summing it up, I feel this rule will benefit everyone and is really important for International students and companies equally.
