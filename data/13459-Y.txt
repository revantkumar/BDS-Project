I think the STEM OPT is a wonderful idea. I SUPPORT this rule to pass.

I don't think it make sense to educate all this brilliant young people and return to their own country after graduation. I personally have been working with quite a few of international students. They are young, smart and hard working. They bring fresh ideas and diversity to the work place. I love working with them and being around them and learn about their culture and their point of view. I think everybody that wants to contribute to this society deserves a chance.

By the way, being their friend, I know all about their struggle. We are making the rules so cruel for the highly intelligent young people to get a job and stay here while we have hundreds and thousands of illigal immigrants and refugees that are not contributing to the society in the system. And knowing their struggle I can say there's no such things as they are "stealing" jobs from out local STEM technicians. If they ever do get hired and sponsored, that would be the company cannot find anyone local to fill the position.

All in all, I do not think this rule will bring any harm. Instead, I think it will benefit out society a lot. Remember, we are an immigration country, that's who we are and that's how we grow. And also remember, we were all immigrants once.

I support the STEM OPT rule.
