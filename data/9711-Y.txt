BUK LU LU This rule doesn't steal money from social security or medicare. People on visas donot get social security or medicare benefits. That is why the government doesn't take money from them. They pay federal and state taxes. OPT students buy their own insurance and cannot sit at home and claim unemployment benefits. They contribute to the economy and donot become a burden on the country. 

STEM means Science, Technology, Engineering and Math. 

People like Richard Trumpka compare this program to guest worker programs. That is so wrong. Guest workers are usually agricultural laborers and perform jobs which require no skill. STEM workers have extensive education/research behind them and comparing them to guest workers is an insult whether its directed towards people who are not citizens or not.

Although I do agree that there should be better oversight into fake companies and consultancies who misuse this regulation. They are the ones who are bringing bad name to everyone.

I am sure this regulation will be beneficial to American economy.
