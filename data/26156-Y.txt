The number of international students in such STEM courses is more than the American students. There is no fault of the international students in this matter. When a company is in need of a particular skillset which is present in these Masters' students, I believe a rule like this will only encourage the Employers to hire international students without any hesitation. International students will never want to snatch jobs, it is just the skillset and qualification that gives them a upperhand.
