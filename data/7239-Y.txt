The new proposed rule is great! My company desperately need some foreign students from India, China who know more about their homeland market than the native STEM students do, to help them opening branches in those countries. After all, Asia is the largest markets. 24 months would give those students more time and flexibility to get more familiar with the company's business. This would hugely benefit the company.
