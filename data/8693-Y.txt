I strongly support this extension. I see a lot people complaining about getting difficult finding a job for US citizens. Do you think about why? Why companies prefer to hire foreign students instead of our citizens?
Foreign students have their difficulties in language, culture. They have no friend to help them. Don't you think it's better to work with someone grown up in the same culture as you do? Why the companies don't do that?
You cannot say those students do more work with less salary: under the law, they were treated equally. And I believe US citizens are as smart as they do, so why? 
No matter with or without this extension, I believe companies won't hire under qualified people, no matter they are US citizens or not. It's better for people to think about theirselves before complaining about others.
