I strongly support the STEM extension . It is a policy not only benefits internationals but also benefits the whole country. Those students learn knowledge from this county, they are smart , hard working and want to use their knowledge to contribute to this country in return. This country educated them and they paid a lot of price for that,. In that case , they know how hard to get that opportunity so they always appreciate the stay and work hard in return. They deserve a right to stay and keep making contribution to the country. Americans, we are a diverse country and we really welcom those people that really appreciate the opportunity and make contribution to us.
