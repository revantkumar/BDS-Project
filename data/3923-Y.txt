I strongly support this OPT extension. It is a best a way to give foreign people more opportunity to work and contribute to US. As described in this documentation, this extension would allow the students with a U.S. degree to work in US for an extended period of time the previous 12 months. US government spend quite a mount of money to educate students, so they can work in U.S. after graduation and make their contribution to this country. It also give those talented people more chance to stay there and continue work and study.
