For hundreds of years, American has been the strongest country in the world, because it embraces talent immigrants. A country cannot develop faster if its citizens have limited horizons. Legal immigrants will not hurt the interests of present citizens, because talent people will contribute this country to make it keep strong, and they will benefit for the community because of their hard-working. Look at Silicon Valley, most of employees are not citizens when they're in the college. But because of opened immigration policy, their assiduous work finally bring them chances to devote to developing American technology. Domestic students care about their so-called interests of getting jobs as they are drunk in the college and do not care much about their studies. Why can these kind of people who every day "enjoy" their lives get the significant jobs so easily? They know to relax and have fun when they are supposed to be diligent, and work hard. American dream is for who eager to learn, to work, to contribute the whole community. Therefore, why cannot students who holds F-1 visa to win the chances for devoting themselves to building America strong?
