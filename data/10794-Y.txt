I support the proposal for OPT extension for the following reasons:

1. The foreign students took universities in the US and learn knowledge to better contribute to the US companies and serve the country, doing the OPT extension can help US companies develop better and faster.

2. There are not that many US citizens learn STEM majors in school, this situation is not affected by foreign students, it depends on personal preference or family influence or the environment. If the OPT extension is not approved, there will be less employees doing STEM which results in the reduction of productivity of STEM industry. The US economy will be affected.

3. Diversity is of vital importance for the US, especially the market is tending to be global nowadays, getting more international students will definitely help the company doing global business. 

4. Cutting off international employees will reduce the competition of US job market, US students will think there will be no competitors in their field, the quality of each employee will be reduced.
