we spend so much money for this education in USA ,there should be practical exposure for this America is as we came from far out of the globe we worked here we are paying taxes too much more than an average american citizen we used our knowledge to make america great most of the poeple who come here for studies need more time yes i agree with rule i am an student who pays more to study here like if i paid 60000 dollars per year an average student who was born here pays less than half the price did i have the chance here to do be here for what i have leaned and paid the government in the form of fees and other fees i buy cars here as a citizen i pay all the taxes how a normal citizen pays ,i need to spend more time here to gain more knowledge i strongly support this rule
