It seems nowadays, only a bureaucratic progressive Govt. would want to hire illegals, foreign workers or migrants over legal American workers. The Govt. seems to be willing to continue to push the REAL jobless rate (not 5% as the Govt . said, but really 10%) and not hire needy American workers. 93-4 million American legal workers are out of the job market. Needless to say, hiring foreign workers at America's expense is simply unpatriotic. In the last 7 years, Americans have gotten the jabs of everything from racism to unpatriotic because a huge majority does not want illegals and others from abroad to take our work potential, and jobs that really are ' shovel ready.' Stop hiring illegals and foreign workers and feel good about finally being American again.
