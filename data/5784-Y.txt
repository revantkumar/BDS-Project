Since STEM majors are the most popular areas in both education and technology, top universities around USA are attracting thousands of international students to study abroad and pursue their higher degrees. Most of the students are very smart and talented and can contribute a lot if they can stay at high-tech companies in USA after their graduation. Of course, Many companies like Facebook, Google have huge demanding of such smart talents to work and support their company and as a fact many technicians and workers in big technology companies in USA are STEM international students. 
If the OPT for STEM students can be extended to a longer period, it is a big benefit to both companies and US economy.
I strongly suggest that for STEM major international students, their OPT should be extended as expected. Such that the companies can recruit technical talents from all over the world and US can accelerate its economy and stay in the leading position in every STEM fields around the globe.
