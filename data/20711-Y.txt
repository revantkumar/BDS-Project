There are some fields (especially IT field) that few US citizen are studying and working on. Those companies are highly developing now and seeking for more employees. The lack of employees could be filled by hiring foreign people. A longer time for employment authorization could bring more benefits on the work itself (e.g. Some projects may need several years to complete). 
This policy will also keep talent people working for the US and leave more techniques, ideas, contributions on this land.
