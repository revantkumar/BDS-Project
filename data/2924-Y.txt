From my perspective, this proposal should be passed. 

I am an international student who just graduated from a top-tier school, with a degree in Engineering. I have developed a very strong skillset in engineering and quantitative analysis, and was hired by a industry leading firm. At my position, I have contributed a lot to the company and US society. But now, I may not be able to keep contributing just because the failure of the OPT extension. 

I want to be able to contribute to the world by applying the advanced knowledge I learned in the US. I want the proposal to be passed.
