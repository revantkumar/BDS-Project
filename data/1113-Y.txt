1. Foreign students with advanced degree in STEM can make contribution in the American industry as well as economy. 
2. This regulation can potentially attract more talented people to come to US, and also further contribute to the whole society.
3. Competition is not a bad thing, which can greatly encourage self-improvement of people.
