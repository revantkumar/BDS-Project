I strongly support this new rule could get passed, as a person who is right now working by opt extension. i am in dangerous of being kicked out of USA at any time,since the opt extension got void in August, this would also be an earthquake for my current company, current client, and current team, cause no one can replace my position right now, i really help my team a lot, and actually there are hundreds of thousands same situation as my case, if we are forced out of USA, i can not imagine how serious damage it would make to this country.

i spent two year and half to study here, cost one hundred thousands dollars, now maybe ruthlessly sweep out, i never think about immigrant, never think about stay here forever, i only want to get two or three more years working experience other than just get one paper(diploma) and go, and i think most foreign students are unwilling to do so, every year USA attract million oversea students, lots of education institute rely on foreign student resource, i think opt is one of the most important reason, and this is also the biggest advantage about studying in USA comparing to other western countries like UK. Without opt extension, the attraction no longer exist any more.

i hope this new rule could pass smoothly, cause this is an everything gain but no lose thing.
