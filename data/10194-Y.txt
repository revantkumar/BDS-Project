Blank Anonymous After reviewing the comments, it is apparent to see that most of the people who support the OPT extension rule are international students. In fact, many international students support the OPT extension because the rule increases their chances of getting H1B visas, and finally, becoming permanent residents.

I am just wondering how these comments can be unbiased. Although it is understandable that they just want to have a better life in the U.S, they are not supposed to show immigrant intent since F-1 visas are non-immigrant visas.

Talented foreign students are more than welcome to work for American companies if American students are not qualified to do the job. If the companies really need to hire foreign students who they think are irreplaceable, it is better to give these students permanent resident status directly when they get the jobs. Because the companies have to spend more money on these employees and have to be more prudent when hiring them since these students could not be treated differently from U.S. citizens and be potentially abused any more. And consequently, the interest of U.S. citizens can be better protected because it will force companies to think more about training and hiring American people instead of hiring mediocre foreign students who will be more expensive.
