I strongly support the OPT extension. The United States of America is a great country because of its generations of immigrants. Now that the most talented students are rushing to the US to study and work and contribute their youth and energy, why stop them? They come from STEM majors, the supply of which is much less from American nationals. Now that there are people wiling to fill the gap, why stop them? Why deny the foreign students the opportunity to work for the US?! This is against the fundamental principles of how this country was established!
