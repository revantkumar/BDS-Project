Chanpreet Kaur I think the new rule for STEM extension is a positive step taken by Department of Homeland Security. It gives the time and opportunity to students to gain practical knowledge of the field they have studied in their degrees. It also allows the student to contribute in success of technical Development in United states. Considering the fact that a lot of scientists and researchers in United States are foreign nationals, even the government of United States understands the need for foreign intellectuals in the country.

The students come to United States for degrees related to Science , technology and mathematics because of the advancement techniques and research opportunities here and later on during STEM extension period these students contribute their knowledge, skills and learning in further advancement of such technologies in the United States. 

If STEM extension is not provided, these students will learn about new technologies in United States, go back to their countries immediately and work on new projects in their country. United States would not gain anything from this. 

Therefore, I support the new rule of providing OPT extension to courses related to STEM degrees.
