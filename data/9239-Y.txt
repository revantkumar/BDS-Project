I think we should prolong the OPT.
1.Longer OPT will attract more international students to come to the U.S. for higher education, which is better for the development of U.S. schools for the better diversity.
2.It will be better if more talented people work in the U.S. because it is good for the development of U.S. economy.
3.The diversity of U.S. workers is good for the development of the U.S. development.
Thanks
