I strongly support this proposed law for following reasons:

1. USA is built by foreign immigrants. It is to our benefit to attract talents from over the world to contribute to the success of our country. Everyone should be treated equally regardless where they come from. These talented immigrant come here through legal channels, and they will help boost American economy.

2. If we look at the population of immigrants who settled for jobs in US, the number is very small. So in reality, they are not taking jobs from American people. Other other hand, the cost of hiring foreign workers is higher than native ones, due to visa sponsorship and higher salary(by law). This means naturally employee favors native worker unless the foreign worker is far more competitive than native ones. So whoever foreign workers get a job in US is very talented in their field of study. And if we create opportunities for these highly skilled workers, the contribution to our economy is huge.

3. We rely on foreign workers. If we look at high tech companies like Google, Amazon, Apple, etc. A large number of technical jobs are held by foreign nationals. If we do not create legal status for these people, we are creating a huge economic impact on our business and lose leadership in competition.
