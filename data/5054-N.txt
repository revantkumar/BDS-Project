This rule undermines american workers and american college graduates looking for work. This rule will depress wages for all american workers. Foreign students if allowed to work and stay for longer periods of time will further worsen green card backlogs in the immigration system.
Overall this rule is detrimental to US citizens and should be scrapped in its entirety.
