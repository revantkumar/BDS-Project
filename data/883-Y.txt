YES! I do support the OPT-EXTENSION, 

In past several years, foreign tech workers contributed the fast growth of US economy. With their help, the company can get more revenue, expand business, create more job positions. 

Differ from US citizen, OPT holders' jobs have to be directly related to their field of study. Most of these jobs are not easy, those high tech companies have to spend money, time, and resource to train new graduates. Without the policies like OPT-EXTENSION, more than 70% of OPT holders have to leave US due to the H1B lottery. Then, all these training becomes lost, not only to those companies , but also to the whole country. 

Global market competition is a big topic for all global companies such as IBM, GM, Ford and so on. Cancelling policies like OPT- EXTENSION will only hurt US economy. Just do a quick study, only those really talented foreign students can get the chance to work after they graduated. It's not because of the lower pay rate or less tax, but most likely the high GPA, bilingual background, positive work attitude, and so on. With the help from all those foreign worker, US company can get huge advantage in global competition, and then create more job openings. 

Some people say that OPT holder is stealing jobs from Americans. It is absolutely wrong. Please take a look at job market, those high tech companies can never hire enough well educated engineers. But if you step into a graduated level class in STEM major, you will not see too many Americans. In fact, due to the sponsorship issue, company is more willing to hire a US citizen, if they are both well educated and with professional skill. 

Sending those well educated people back to their home country doesn't mean that more American can get job. On the contrary, due to the lack of professional, more and more jobs will be outsourced to other countries. It may highly increase the unemployment rate and cause more social problems.
