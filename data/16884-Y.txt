I believe USA will absolutely benefit from this policy and we do understand the importance of maintain the precious resource (STEM student). US employers are making huge advantage of hiring this group of employees and their excellence performance in company are obvious. Besides, most of them speak different language, which makes this group more competitive. I believe if this policy failed, US will absolutely loose millions of dollars every year.
