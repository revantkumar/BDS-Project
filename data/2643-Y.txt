I strongly support this proposal. I have several reasons listed as below:

1. The STEM OPT extension is aimed for the students recieved high education in STEM fields. Those talent people are very important for the U.S. to keep its leading position in the technology field in the world. Those students obtain good education resource in the U.S.. If they want to make contribution to the country which provide them the knowledge for a longer time, there at least should be some choice for them.

2. Keeping the diversity in the country is always inportant for the country to thrive. The OPT extension does make the students from different regions to have longer time to make the U.S better.

3. For some of the students who may have better career opportunity in their home countries. The reason why they still try to stay in the U.S. is that they have feeling with this country. They feel like this is the country they want to live in.
