I am a Graduate Student in USA, Major in Computer Science. Nowadays, America is the most developed country in this earth, one of the most reasons is that the elites from all over of the world came here to build this country, because America is a country with Freedom and democracy, so can Attract more talents. More and more talents want to be here to work for America, IT IS A GOOD THING. If fewer talents want to be here, that is to say, the America Economy is going down. 

SO I think, If The US Government gives generous Time in Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students. That Definitely can improve America Economy, and bring much worth for America and attract more and more Elites from all over the world.
