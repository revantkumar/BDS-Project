I think that this is a great and positive move towards building US economy by providing favorable environment for STEM international students. The STEM industry has clearly reported insufficient number of skilled workers in this field. Such industry could definitely benefit from this rule and may provide significant uplift to US economy.

I would have like to see 36 month extension instead of 24 but this is definitely a positive move.
