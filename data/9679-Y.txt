I'm here to support this proposed rule for non-immigrant students with STEM degrees are playing an important role in enhancing the power of United States in all aspects especially in high-tech and finance.

It is agreed that people are the essence of creating any great things. Students who can get admissions to US colleges or graduate schools are mostly excellent, smart students in their own countries. For instance, many of my friends are from top schools in their own countries, some are among the most talented people in the world. They won Olympics Math competitions and were admitted to US colleges without doubt. These people, no matter what they do in the future, will make valuable contributions to enhancing the strength of US. If they have to leave US due to unfavorable policies, that will be a big loss both to these students and the country. 

We can also see that US, which has always been a home to immigrants, can stand in the world as the leading and most powerful country because it welcomes all kinds of people in the world. Elon Musk comes from south Africa, who creates this brilliant company in US. He was at first a PhD candidate in Stanford and then became a US citizen. I'm not sure if he used OPT after he got out of Stanford, but what I want to point out here is that, there are students like him in US, who might be the next Elon Musk, have to leave the country because his OPT is expiring soon and not lucky enough to get H1B. If the government can have better policies for non-immigrant students with STEM degrees to stay here longer, we can definitely see more possibilities happening in this nation brought by these students.
