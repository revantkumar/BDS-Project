S Jia Please, do not mix legal immigrants with illegal ones. 

The former means more taxpayers, more jobs created, economical increase and a better America. While the latter means more burden on taxpayers' shoulder, jobs stolen by them for lower salary and damage to America. 

Illegal immigrants are the one who are stealing jobs. H1b and H4 contracting/outsourcing companies like Infosys, Tata CS, Cognizant are the one who are stealing job opportunities from american people and legal immigrants.
