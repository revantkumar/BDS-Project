I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons. OPT extension will attract more competitive international students to contribute to the U.S science and technology. Extension failure will definitely lead to the decreasing number of international employees, which is a loss for the U.S, especially in the IT and industry fields. In addition, one-year OPT is negative to a number of companies, considering the long duration of various projects, which let them have to hire new employees with less experience.
In my point of view, it is unreasonable to conclude that international students will grab more opportunities due to lower wages. We can easily find a lot of international software engineers with more than 10K salary in California and other states.What is more, international employees can only work in the fields related to their degree. This limitation makes them ineligible for many jobs. In fact, most positions are open for native candidates. However, there are still many companies eager to OPT extension or even increasing number of H1B. The reason is that some advanced positions can not be filled up only by people with permanent work authorization. That is the significance of OPT extension.
