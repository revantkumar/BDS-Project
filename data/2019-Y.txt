I absolutely SUPPORT this proposal that extends the STEM OPT to 24 months. 
I'm a Chinese student applying for the United States graduate school this year. What attract me is the culture of America and the chances it offers to the foreigners. The American always says it is a melting pot. If this proposal is withdrawal, the America seems to lose its advantage of attracting talented people. The STEM OPT is good because it offers students a chance to gain more working experience and when they back to their hometown they become more competitive. Other countries like Canada, Australia and UK are taking a lot of effort to attract foreign students to study in their country, and what make America different is it STEM OPT, this is a strong reason why I choose US, I believe many other people also think this way. Education take a great proportion of GDP in the US, and the accompany economic incentives. I hope the government always remember why you decided to take this OPT extension proposal.
