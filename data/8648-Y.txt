As a Chinese student, I support expanding OPT for STEM with additional 24 months because of the following reasons.

First, the economy in US is growing faster, and the employment of workers who majors in STEM is NOT limited. There's no reason to prevent international student from working in united state. All the companies will only hire the people they think STRONG enough. With strong people, US can obviously develop better, and continue to be the leader in STEM throughout the world. And, there are ENOUGH POSITIONS FOR EVERYONE to find a job in STEM. Therefore, there's no reason to prevent international student from working in US.

Second, the main reason from people who disagree with this expanding is they want to protect the profit of US citizen. As we all know, the most important reason why united state can be the strongest county in the world is they KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO ABSORB GREATEST PEOPLE throughout the world. This is why US becomes what it is like today. It is fair and necessary to have some US citizen unemployed because of their own weakness or laziness. Therefore, there is no reason to stop this expanding, if US still want to be the best in the world.

Third, if we cancel this expanding, all the potential greatest scientists will have to go back to their hometown, and support their local company or government to compete with US. Everyone want to live a better life, and if they cannot live in united state, the only choice is to improve their hometown. For me, if I cannot work in here, I will bring all the knowledge back to China. I think this is no good for the entire human. Because only by grouping greatest people together can we make the world better and better.
