I very much agree with this proposed 24 month STEM OPT extension. 
It will provide a greater opportunity for foreign students to practice and apply their skills in STEM in U.S. companies. 
Not only will it benefit foreign students, but it will also help American companies maintain a global competitive edge by 
bringing a larger pool of eligible employee candidates holding STEM skills. This proposal would also allow these foreign students
to contribute their knowledge in such fields and in turn create innovation in U.S. companies.
