I think the extension of OPT in STEM is a very good proposal which will benefit US in the future.

In the past 200 years, it is the brave and brilliant immigrants from old continent who left their homeland and built the great America. I can say without exaggeration that the unending immigrants from all around the world is the engine and prime power that led US to the strongest country nowadays.

Today's international students working with OPT have no difference from those old immigrants. They bring the top talent from other countries. They have the knowledge and skill set badly needed by American employers. They fight to make their life better, they fight to make their company better, and they fight to make this country better. That's what American values, encourages and lives with, isn't it? I don't see any reason they should be denied the opportunity earned by their own.

Society without competition is society without progress. Competition is the power of the progress of United States. The Americans I know are proud, confident, and brave. They never fear competition. But those people who are posting against this proposal look so strange to me. They are complaining others for their personal failure. They grow up in America. They can speak fluent English. They are familiar with every aspect of American culture. They have numberless advantages compared with those international students. However, they don't dare to compete with those foreigners. Even worse, they are begging the government to handout jobs. I just can't believe it. WHAT A SHAME! Even if there is no such OPT thing, those openings are not provided for this kind of losers and cowards. Everyone, regardless of nationality, should fight for a job, but not beg for it.
