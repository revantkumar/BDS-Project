The government should definitely extend the training opportunities. The U.S. economy is supported largely by high technology industries, and that's the main degrees foreign students come for. If the training opportunities is decreased, then it wouldn't be so attractive for excellent foreign students because they want to gain some experience in the U.S. before coming back to their own country. If we lost excellent workforce, the impact to the whole economy is terrible.
