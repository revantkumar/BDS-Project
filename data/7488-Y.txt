Sherry Cho I totally Support this proposal. These talented and hard-working international students contribute a lot to the US economy. International students are already in the disadvantageous stage, as they need support with their legal status. The extension of OPT is providing them an equal job opportunity versus domestic competitors. Those who didn't get hired by the Hi-tech companies are because of the lack of knowledge and skill. If elite foreigners left because of the immigration rule, I doubt that these people could save the economy and the industry. Thus expanding the OPT extension for the students with STEM degrees is definitely the best way to help improve the Hi-tech industry.
