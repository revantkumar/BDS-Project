I strongly support the new OPT proposal. The new OPT will be very helpful for the USA to keep more international talents in STEM related industries. The USA has offered education opportunities to so many international students, and should be rewarded by their hard working. Moreover, with these international elites, the economy will boom with their creative ideas, creating more job opportunities that for US residents.
