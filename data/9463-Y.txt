Y T 1.Businessman move their business to Vietnam and Honduras, they took away US jobs.
2. International trade treaties brings lower price product, even WTO/FTA/TIFA/BIT/TPP took away US jobs.
3. The Wall Street wolves blow up the balloon, everyone lost the job because the recession.
4. And now the International students paid with full tuition fee with non-immigrate status who are totally legal are make a big job catastrophe while working as intern?

So it's legit to reason as below:
1. we should force businessmen to move their business back to US even it's gonna be bankrupt because of high cost.
2. we should end all the treaties with the world because goods in Walmart will destroy our manufacture industry. 
3. we should close Wall Street to stop greed bankers taking away our pension/fund and stop the financial crisis.
4. We should stop admitting International Students, because once they finished their degrees, they will have the same abilities as US citizen to handle a job. 

And who are we? Are we communists who wanna "protect" this country?

Face it, It a global competition time! Stop whining and start to learn something practical. Work harder and prove yourself to the employer. I really can't think of a situation when an legit employer want a non-immigrant student as Intern other than a equally competitive US citizen.
