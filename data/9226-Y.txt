I fully support the extension of the STEM Opt to 24 months. Here are my reasons: 1st, improve U.S economy from many aspects, daily expenditure, car, housing etc. Good for merchant. 2nd, increasing variety of this society. 3rd, influence other country through this. More elite will come to U.S to work and contribute their effort to make this society better. As we know, it seems not good for U.S's development today, it seems develop slow. In order to make it better, the STEM opt extension will attract more good students to come here to work. 4th, improving the influence of U.S in the world.
