I oppose the extension.
This rule makes it cheaper to hire a foreign graduate for 3 years than a U.S. graduate at the same salary due to exemption from payroll taxes for the foreign OPT worker.

It is preposterous to suggest that a STEM foreign graduate needs 3 years of training after a degree to become a regular worker.

I stand up for U.S. STEM workers and American students seeking STEM careers and ask you to reject OPT.
