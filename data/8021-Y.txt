United States of America is one of the few big countries that aim at providing equality. And so I know for a lot of young students, US is the place to achieve their dreams. They learn the hardest and work the hardest so that they could make an impact in the world and that they could start build their career. I've heard of many cases that excellent young people left US because they were unable to draw the H1B visa merely due to bad luck. 

Looking back the history, all countries have life cycles. But one common thing we can see is that when a country is prosperous, it will draw excellent and smart people to the country rather than drifting them away. As a BIG country, I think we should collect smart and hard working people so that we can be a better country. Therefore I hope the government would authorize the 24 months STEM program to give them a better and fair chance to obtain the employment status.
