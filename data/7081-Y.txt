I strongly support this rule.

Based the history of the United States, talented immigrants in science and other fields is the most important player for the development and prosperity of the states. A working mechanism, like this one, to keep students in STEM field is necessary to attract talents in the American workforce. This will help US seize the opportunity for science and technology development, and ultimately secure the leading position of US in the world. 

It seems at first will introduce competition of jobs for American citizens. However, new technology development in the STEM field means more jobs, which are nor limited to STEM fields. For instance, a high-tech company will need business major students as well as people in administration (which high level [graduate/doctoral] education is not a requirement). Thus, this policy will increase job opportunity for American citizens. Ultimately, all American citizens will benefit from this policy and live a better live.
