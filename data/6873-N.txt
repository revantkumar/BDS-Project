Foreign students should not be allowed to comment on this site as they are not taxpayers and are the ones who are displacing
American workers in order for companies to pay less money to them; i.e. their salaries are usually less and they and the companies 
that hire them pay nothing into Social Security and Medicare. This is resulting in bigger deficits in Social Security and Medicare
due to the abuses of companies laying off American workers who do pay into it and being replaced with these F-1 Students. 
This is a travesty and any increase in this program and expansion of time allowed to work in the U.S. is a dereliction on your part
of protecting American workers which should be your first concern and duty. How could you possibly justify the 
increases you are contemplating with millions of American citizen STEM workers unable to find work in their field due to the fact
that this program is already too bloated and far reaching? Please cite any statistics and their sources that support your actions.
And, please, do not say that companies have a labor shortage for STEM positions as this has been proven to be totally untrue.
