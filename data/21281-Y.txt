I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:

1. The governmentshould let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S. If international students complete their study and go back to their home country right away, that would be a great loss for America.

2. Diversity is veryimportant for the U.S. A lot of great people were international students before they got the accomplishment. Diversity, along with freedom, is what makes America awesome.

3. Competition doesexist, but is not a bad thing. With competition, everyone would try harder and make themselves better. That's how our world gets better and better.
