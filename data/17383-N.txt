We must put American workers first. This system that our own government is trying to put in place for foreign workers in the USA is wrong. We must make sure that ALL Americans have first choice for all jobs in the USA. Our college graduates cannot find jobs and many experienced American workers are now forced to train foreign workers to replace them. No more H-1b or any contract workers in the USA, these corporations/companies are paying them less than American workers with no benefits. Americans are being displaced in their own country.

Where are the rights of American citizens who are being forced out of jobs. I must insist that all foreign contract workers such as the H-1b workers be denied jobs in the USA and replaced by American citizens only. Anything else is a travesty to the American people. NO OPT should be allowed in the USA! All f-1 stem should be denied.
American citizens are well educated and many are working globally. Protect Americans only.

It is a lie that American workers are not qualified when our own children are sitting in American college classes with these same foreign students and the American people have also have excellent educations, possibly better. Why are the foreign people sending their children over to attend American colleges if they were not excellent as our own American college students are being taught sitting in the same American class rooms.

Corporations/companies have lied to the government and our American citizens only for cheaper wages and benefit, American citizens rights are being denied.
