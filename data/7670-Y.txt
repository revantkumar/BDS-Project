American economy, especially in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mechanics, is driven by lots of immigrants. If there's no OPT extension, about 1/3 of these immigrants won't get H1B visa and thus leave America. US GDP would drop a lot, and of course, these position can not be filled by native American immediately because of lack in experience. However, STEM area is the strength of our Asian. Look at the quantitative positions in Investment Banks, most of them are immigrants and many of them have no H1B yet and wait for the draw next year. If OPT extension is cancelled, it will create a large impact on these Investment Banks. 
On the other hands, those against OPT extension naively think we immigrants grab their jobs. In fact, because of our efforts and contribution to this country, many companies can survive and thrive, and thus will provide more positions. Without our existence, many companies will bankrupt and there will be much less opportunities for native American. Remember the United States is an immigrant country!
