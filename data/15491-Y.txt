My friend is from China and graduated from a grad school of US university and now working as an Electrical Engineer in a solar company. She is working on energy optimization of solar farms to save energy. Hundreds of jobs opened when there is a new solar farm in construction. And the company is expanding rapidly that several new farms are opened each year. Monitoring and maintenance also open hundreds of jobs. Newly opened jobs of this industry will decrease in the order of thousands or even more if people like her are losing the working opportunity in US. The energy produced by the farms will no longer be that efficient if no one like her are losing the working opportunity in US. Some people are talking about depending on us own. But how? US citizens like me don't like math, don't like calculating energy optimization; to make a living, what we can do is our labor, which will be needed more and more if people like her got hired. We are a country of diversity but not one kind of people; opt extension will certainly gather these smart people all over the world to US and help us advance the country.
