I totally agree the Proposed Rule on "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students" by the Homeland Security Department. 

The proposed Rule will definitely accelerate economic blooming of US and will benefit US job market and US public. Most of F-1 students have advanced degrees in their professional fields. More training opportunities for F-1 students will bring fresh blood to US industries and will result in new technology developments. This is true and admitted by US public. With new developments and technologies, more opportunities will be available in job market and be provided to public. On the other hand, more opportunities for F-1 students will stimulate expenses in all walks of life, especially retail trading, food trading, travel trading etc.. It will bring more job opportunities to public in these fields. 

In conclusion, the Proposed Rule will be under US national interesting and will be significant to economic cycle of US.
