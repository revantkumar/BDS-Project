I DO SUPPORT the opt-extension rule
A short-term relief might be brought to us if international students are driven out. However, the short-term satisfaction will result in great loss of long-term benefits to the US tax payers! International STEM students will directly go back to their country or go to other welcoming countries if they are rejected by the US. These students, who could have brought the US dramatic progress and power, will devote to scientific research, entrepreneurship, public policy and other fields that empower and create jobs for other countries. I believe US, which is a country with the most brightest mind, will always make the best choice---keep the international labor forces who are highly educated with STEM OPT extension rule.
