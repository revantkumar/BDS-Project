I strongly support this rule!
I totally understand that citizens are afraid of losing job positions. There is no need to worry because not a single company will hire an international student if there is a qualified citizen candidate! This rule is only for STEM major students, and they are all limited only to fill the void positions that citizens can't fill! 
As I know, a lot IT companies are highly rely on international employees because there are lack of citizens who are interested in IT industry. Also, because US spends a lot educational resources on STEM international students, it is a natural idea to let them stay to make contribution to US economy. 
Only most talent international students can find jobs in US, they are the engine of economic growth! They will create much more job positions in the future than they take today.
