Harry Shi I am STRONGLY SUPPORT this proposed rule since the STEM EXTENSION will better ensure that students gain valuable practical STEM experience that supplements knowledge gained through their academic studies. However, the opposite commenters keep criticizing STEM students hurting American workers. It is NOT TRUE because companies are not going to hire the employees who do not have the capability to fulfill their jobs even if you are Americans. In other words, most Americans prefer NOT to work on the hard jobs, that is the reason why companies start hiring international students. In addition, I firmly believe Competition and Diversity will NEVER be a bad thing. The opposite commenters should stop criticizing and start making a way to enrich your knowledge and brain. As a result, the U.S. truly deeply need to extend STEM OPT to keep these valuable STEM students.
