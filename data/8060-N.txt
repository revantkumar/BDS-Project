"OPT was not meant to extend work visa's nor was it a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans." It was meant to be a temporary training program. We do not need to give corporations any more incentives to gain wealth at the expense of American workers, and we don't need ANY more foreign workers in our country for a very long time. We need to take care of Americans who are unemployed first!
