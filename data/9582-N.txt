I THINK WE NEED TO IDENTIFY WHO IS COMMETNING ON AMERICAN GOVT MATTERS IN THESE REGULATIONS PAGES. I NOTE THAT FOREIGNERS WHO ARE HERE ON VISAS TO STUDY ARE NOT AMERICAN CITIZENS AND WHEN THEY SEE4 AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENRICH THEMSELVES ARE VERY VOCAL ON AMERICAN GOVT MATTERS. I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS IS SENSIBLE OR FAIR TO ALLOW THE AMERICAN GOVT TO BE SWAYED BY THE COMMENTS OF FOREIGN CITIZENS. I THINK AMERICAN CITIZENS SE TUP THIS COMMENT FORUM FOR AMERICAN CITIZENS ONLY TO COMEMTN ON AMERICAN GOVT MATTERS. I DONT THINK FOREIGNERS ON VISAS HAVE TH RIGHT TO COME IN HERE AND TELL AMERICANS HOW TO RUN THEIR GOVT. I THINK THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS TO ALLOW THAT. I THINK THIS SYSTEM NEEDS TO MAKE THOSE WHO WRITE ON HERE IDENTIFY THESMEVLS AS AMERICAN CITZENS WIRH THE RIGH TTO COMMENT ON GOVT. I FIND THAT THOSE FOREIGNERS WHO SEEK TO ENRICH THEMSELVES AT AMERICAN EXPENSE ARE QUICK TO WRITE IN ON THIS MATTER AND THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE THAT RIGHT BECAUSE THEY ARE FOREIGN CITIZENS, NOT CITIZENS OF AMERICA. THIS IS MUCH TOO BROAD AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FOREIGN OPPORTUNISTS TO GET TOGETHER AND VOTE THEMSELVES RICHES AT THE EXPENSE OF AMERICANS. ALL OF THESE STATEMETNS BY PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE ON VISAS SHOULD BE THROWN OUT OF CONSIDERATION BY OUR GOVT AND WE NEED A NEW SYSTEM WHERE IF YOYU WRITE IN YOU ARE AN AM ERICAN CITIZENA COMMENTING ON YOUR OWN GOVT, NOT A VISA HOLDER WHO FAILED TO LEAVE AT TH END OF YOUR VISA TIME OR SOME SUCH INTERLOPER IN AMERICA.
