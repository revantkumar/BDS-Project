Ben Davis American companies and academic institutions possess unique competitive advantages in developing these global leaders. They are remarkably need talented people from diverse backgrounds, and highly skilled at giving future leaders the knowledge and experience they need to lead successfully in the global economy. High-skilled people have provided one of America's greatest competitive advantages. Their education and skills, their knowledge of world markets, their entrepreneurial drive, and hundreds of thousands of jobs created as a result all have fueled growth in the American economy. Without opt-extension, the higher educated students cannot make contribution to America's innovation and the American companies will lack of trained employee for future scientific research and engineering innovation. America's last competitive advantage its ability to innovate is at risk as a result. I highly support opt-extension by all means.
