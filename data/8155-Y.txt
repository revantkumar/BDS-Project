Denise Jensma To whom this concerns:

You've got your education
Did the USA pay for it?

I think you should go back and use 
Your training from where you are from. Then if you want to 
Become a United States citizen. Go through the proper 
Channels .... When you become a USA citizen
You should work and pay taxes just like all of us USA citizen!
