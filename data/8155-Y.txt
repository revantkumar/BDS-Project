I fully support the OPT extension proposal.

I'm not worried about students on OPT stealing jobs from American citizens. Because OPT only allows work related to field of study in which a student is majored. In the case of STEM degrees, the U.S. actually has more job openings than talented labors available[1]. I work in the tech industry, it is very true that we always need to hire. If the 24-months OPT could help our U.S. companies grow and evolve, potentially create a greater international impact, I would say 'why not'; actually, 'why not longer'? 

OPT is not giving away free 24-month jobs to anyone. Instead, our companies know who to skip, who to pick. As far as I know, only the best students can get an internship opportunity after graduation. OPT work permission expires after 90 days unemployment. That means, we made sure only the most talented graduates can stay. In a country like the United States, the last thing I ever want to do is to say no to great talents.

OPT is an extension for the American dream. As long as the U.S. is still a country that believes in opportunity and equality, as long as we still respect hard work and liberty, I don't see why I should not welcome people like you and me to join us. For people who oppose this proposal just because they feel insecure about their jobs, I suggest them improve their professional skills. If immigrants can do it, you can do it better. Don't ever forget your own American dream.
