I am writing with my STRONGEST SUPPORT for the proposal to expand to OPT opportunities for F1 students with STEM degrees. It is my belief that this policy will be constructive and beneficial to the United States' development no matter in a big picture or in a smaller scale, such as for the research institutes or companies that have open positions but can not find a suitable employee among US citizens. 

Due to the high quality education and living environment that US can provide, among other reasons, US has attracted the most clever and hardworking students to study in the STEM fields in the universities across the states. Theses students, especially after they have been fully trained during the master or phd studies, started to use their knowledge to contribute, and become one of the major strength to sustain the leading role of the research and technologies for the United States. It would be a huge damage to the development of US to send them back to their own country before they have enough time to feedback by using what they have learnt. Not to mention universities and companies need them.

Therefore, I strongly support this proposal, which ultimately has more pros over cons for the development of United States.
