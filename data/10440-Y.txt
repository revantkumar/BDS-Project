United states is a place of opportunities irrespective of the profession.I STRONGLY oppose this Stem law.It would be lot better if they would have made the law applicable to all majors.Why are only STEM fields important.So do you realize that world only runs on the people from the STEM fields ? Then why do you need people from those fields.Although the law is fine it is highly biased.There are many professions and each and every one is equally responsible to the development of this world irrespective of the country barrier.

This Stem law is just utter nonsense.If the same law is extended to all the majors and specializations then it would be lot better for America.

Me being from America itself believe we equally need all the people from different profession rather than the same fields over and over.Please look into the matter of extending the same rule for all the majors.

I'm partially towards this law.
