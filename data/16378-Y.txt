I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. As an international student in the United States, I pursued a STEM degree from Johns Hopkins University and graduated with a master's degree of Computer Science. Currently I am working for Amazon.com as an engineer using my 12-month OPT working permit. There are a few reasons that STEM OPT should be extended with 24 months. 

1. With a good OPT policy, United States will be able to keep attracting global talents to study in U.S. One important reason I chose to pursue a master degree here is because U.S. provides great OPT plan so that I can gain practical skills after graduation. This would directly benefit with U.S. high tech companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. With talents from all over the world, these companies are able to thrive in this era of information. 

2. Currently I am working on a few projects in the company. I am the direct responsible engineer for a few of them. In industry, one project typically has a lifecycle of two to three years. If STEM OPT program will be terminated, I think it will cause lots of trouble for the company to find another person to train and let him work on it. 

3. I do not think OPT extension program will affect US citizens to find jobs. Personally, I will go back to my home country after I gain enough experience here in the US. I believe three years will be a good timing for me to practice enough. Before then, I would like to contribute my knowledge to US high-tech companies. 

4. As a fresh graduate, I am always trying to be innovative and come up with new ideas in my daily work. All these new ideas are improving people's life in this country and generating more job opportunities within and outside of the company. 

In conclusion, I believe STEM OPT extension policy will benefit US economy, long-term development of US high-tech companies, and keep US universities attractive to best talents around the world. 

Thanks.
