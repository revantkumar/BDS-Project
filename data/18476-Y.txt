I strongly agree this proposal.
Let's say what will happen if the proposal fails.
For universities: fewer international students, fewer diversity, fewer income, fewer money to invest in educating American students.
For American tech companies: fewer talented tech workers. But the tech companies in foreign countries like China and India, they will get a lot of U.S educated hi-tech grads. American tech companies will then lose the competition with foreign tech companies.
For local economy, international students are actually feeding a lot of Americans. They created a lot of jobs because they eating, shopping and living in U.S.

I think some people who oppose this proposal do not know anything about STEM. They have no idea how difficult it is to become a qualified STEM grads. They thought homeless or unemployed can be easily trained as a qualified STEM worker. 

If U.S still wants to be the best country in STEM, the best way is to attract more talented STEM workers instead of sending them away.
