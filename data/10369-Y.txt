Skilled workers make a huge contribution to today's american industry, such as IT industry. The flexibility of immigration regulations may be one of the most important reasons to attract thousands of skilled and talented foreigners to stay and work after graduation. Without it, American will lose a lot of them especially in todays increasing demands for talents all over the world. For example, an increasing number of Europ countries open their gates for IT talents, which could become a big threat.
