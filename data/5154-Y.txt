Ruby Zhu I highly recommend to extend OPT. 
First of all, extending OPT will give elites more time to stay in US, so that companies will have more opportunities to choose the people they need. 
Second, if the policy got passed, it will attract more talents to come to US. There is no doubt that talents are essential for the development of a country.
Finally, there is no disadvantage for native workers, as most of the students in STEM majors are international students. No conflict exists between native residents and international students.
All of these points can prove that extending OPT is very helpful for the development of American's economic. So I highly recommend to extend STEM OPT to 24 months.
