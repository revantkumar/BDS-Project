I'm more interested in "Big Business" training American workers than importing labor from anywhere outside the United States.
Most of the "STEM Jobs" pay very well and the current American employees end up training their foreign replacements so
"Big Business" can pad their bottom line. This process, in my humble opinion, is a Traitorous Act against America! Any 
business that employs foreign STEM Workers should be required to train three American Workers for each foreign Stem 
Worker on their payroll. We must train and employ our own people BEFORE we import foreign labor! The number of H1B
Visas must be reduced immediately by 75% to help "jump start" our economy. Anytime a foreign STEM Worker 
displaces or is hired in lieu of an American Worker, the business should be required to pay a $1,000,000 penalty (every four
years) which will be deposited in the Social Security Trust Fund to replace the missing recurring deposits of the now 
unemployed or underemployed American Worker. Additionally, The OPT Program should be discontinued immediately.
