Xinchen Pan What I think is, in order for an international student to get a job in United States, he/she should have good grades in college and corresponding skills. Then after uncountable interviews from many companies, they can finally get their jobs. So these people are definitely brilliant ones. Their smartness and diligence got them job offers. Their family spent more than 100 thousand dollars in their education and life expenses in United States. They now have chances to earn them back and make their degree valuable. Meanwhile, they make contribution to American economy. But they face the fact that they cannot get their H-1B visa. Then have to choose to go back to their home countries no matter how well they are doing in their current working companies. Even the companies cannot find people to replace him.

Thus, I firmly support this Act.
