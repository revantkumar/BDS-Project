I STRONGLY SUPPORT the the proposal of OPT EXTENSION for the following reasons:

First and foremost, a huge amount of international students, especially those majoring in science and engineering with fairly strong knowledge background are willing to serve for the society of the US. Therefore, the government should provide them the possibility to make contributions.

Furthermore,diversity is always critical as well as important to the US, which can be distinctively reflected in recent years. For example, lots of development and breakthrough in the areas of science and engineering subjects were made with increasing involvement of international students and workers. Without their help, some significant advancement may have to be delayed for several or even ten years later.

Last but not least, competition does exist; however, such positive competition is extremely beneficial to promote the US society. A large number of positions are not chosen by natives since the native may consider that the salary is not high enough. By contrast, international students are not so picky about choosing positions. In addition,, lots of native people do not have required knowledge or academic background for some high-tech positions, such as computer programming and math-related job positions. In this case, recruiting international students can satisfy the demand, since they are always intelligent as well as diligent. Competition is always the best motive to keep the society moving forward.
