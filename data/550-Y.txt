Sima Zhong Please extend the opt to 24 months. This is a win win for international students and US market.
US need those technical person to fulfill the job market, and those students could do a good job after 
2 years hard work, also We all know how hard to finish a stem degree. 
If after one year work, this student has been well qualified to his job and is ready to contribute the firm, while the opt won't let it stay, this could be a big loss for the firm, corporate will need to rehire and train for new candidate.
And because of this they might do not want to hire international student, so how can US college attract more people around world to come here and study. Actually, without international students, many college won't have master degree. You know how many international students in a master degree class. Besides, Think about how much those students has spent here, no matter tuition, travel, shopping, without those people, market could loose a lot of sales, and people would lose their jobs since spending is not enough to improve employment. 
Some people might say international students steal their jobs, while the truth might be they are creating many jobs instead, because they are spending money when they stay here, which make firm produce and hire new employees!
