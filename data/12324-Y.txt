OPT extension by 24 months will be extremely helpful to all the international students seeking a lawful work permit after the graduation. 

I believe there are thousands of students in the US who will be benefited from this law. 

Out of all the problems that an international student faces, this law will definitely reduce one of his/her problem. 

Hope this goes into effect very soon
