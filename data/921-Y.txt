Allowing 24-month STEM OPT extension is a very important step towards alleviating the current H1-B cap problem. This gives a little extra time for U.S. companies to retain their talent, and increases the chances of a successful transition to the H1-B status. Hopefully, with a more comprehensive immigration reform, the H1-B cap will also be increased, contributing to the prosperity of the U.S. economy and with retaining the bright and skilled people it has spent public resources educating.
