Anonymous Anonymous I strongly support the OPT extension. Those international students are supporting this country's only left industries when most local American people starts to choose other jobs with more free time and fun than STEM subjects. U.S needs those students to help the country to remain competitive when facing more competition pressure from fast-growing countries around the world. If you think they steal the jobs from you, then that probably means you are falling behind the era and need to catch up.
