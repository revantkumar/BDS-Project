I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months because we need to give the best and the brightest students every opportunity to succeed in the U.S. I have several friends who have used their OPT and are serving in STEM jobs. However, OPT is not long enough under the current rule. One dear friend is having to return to his African country even though his employer wants him to remain at work and he wishes to continue investing in his field.
