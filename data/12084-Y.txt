The rule has a significant impact to the US economy. Please approve. 
STEM OPT extension is a win-win situation. The STEM graduates would not take the jobs from US citizen. The employers would not replace the US worker. The employers have to maintain the supporting document to proof the eligibility of the STEM employee. Let's give an example of the qualification of a STEM graduate: one of the founders of a billion dollar company in India was a STEM graduate from USA. Not only one, I can give a million examples of the highly qualified STEM graduates. They learn the latest technology from the top rank universities, and apply the skills to the US companies. The students do contribute to the innovation that has a huge impact to the US economy. Most of them are coming here for higher study (MS or Phd). Think about the students who are coming with a full scholarship to the top rank universities such as UC Berkley, MIT, Harvard, Stanford, and so on.
