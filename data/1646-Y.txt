I strongly SUPPORT this extension. 
First of all, as a international student in an American university, I must say we are qualified to work here. The school taught us well. We gain knowledge, skill and experience after years of study, and we are willing to contribute all we got back to America. We are good engineers in all area.
Second, America need us. I know there are still unemployment issue for US citizen, but we get in by equal competition. We get the job by proving that we have stronger ability than other people who applied for the job, not by stating we are internationals. On the other hand, competition can stimulate US citizens to work harder in order to compete with us, thus improve the quality of overall labors in US.
