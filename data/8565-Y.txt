I think the proposal for 24 extension of OPT is great for my company, and also, for the overall economy. America need more and more technical people to improve the company performance, so the extension can promote more local employment. There are 3 advantages of the STEM people:

1: these STEM people can work in technical company, improve the company performance, the companies need a lot of engineers. 

2: the extension can make the STEM student work longer, so the company can save money to recruit new people. What does the new hire mean? It means the company need to take money to train them and make them familiar with the company. 

3: I think most of the Americans don't want to be engineers, but the company need more engineers, so I think the proposal for 24 extension of OPT gonna solve the problem. 

In summary, the OPT extension should be prolonged, due to the OPT people's contributions to the tech companies, as well as the consequential advantages for the other matching jobs, in the end, we can have a more blooming economy.
