I definitely support the proposal for the reasons as below:

1. International students not only learnt in their own countries but also learnt in US which gives them broad vision about what is going on in this world. Having this kind of international students employed is able to let the domestic companies know the real circumstances across the whole world, understand the future trends which will be prevalent and seize this opportunity to develop themselves. 

2. Nonetheless the diversity is clearly demonstrated, those international students make obvious contributions to the economics growth in America. STEM fields are not the fields which most American students like. However, America is still the lead in STEM fields in the world because STEM international students played a significant role to drive success of American domestic companies in STEM fields.

3. Even though the competition exists, the unemployed rate in America is as low as 5% which is the most low one among the last 10 years. Due to the contributions made by the international students, most companies provide more opportunities across the country which is a splendid benefit for US citizens.
