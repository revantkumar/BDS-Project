I was an international student at Columbia University before. More than 10% of the students there are international students. I was always thinking why US has so many top universities more than anywhere in the world. One reason I come up is that these universities attract the most brilliant students not only from US but from all over the world. One of the most important reason that these top students choose US top universities is US can provide them with a better career future than anywhere else. We are attracted by the best high tech companies, the equal opportunity and the friendly working environment. If we lose the OPT extension program, our career in US is dim because we have to leave US after one year when our career just begins. If OPT extension program is cancelled, international students would rather choose to study in our homeland instead of paying high tuition fees for study and go back. I hope this program can be kept, this is not only for the benefit for the huge group of international students but the benefit of US.
