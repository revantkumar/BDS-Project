I I strongly support this rule. I believe the 24 month OPT STEM rule will benefit the economy of US dramatically, and makes US a more competitive and attractive country. 

In my opinion, US can be so strong and economy is so great today because of the open-minding for talents. During the second war, US attracted a lot of scientist and engineer abroad, and those people helped US a lot. And for the STEM, students who learning science and engineering can use their knowledge learned in US and make contribution to US. Besides, I don't think this will seriously affect the citizen to find jobs in those fields, because the high tech industry grow some fast that a lot of jobs are open. They need a lot of qualified scientist and engineer. So that's the reason I support this rule.
