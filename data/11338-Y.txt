I firmly believe that OPT should be extended for STEM students.
One of the reason that OPT is only extended to STEM students instead of for all foreign students is due to the lack of qualified labors for high-tech companies. So for those who said STEM workers steal American people's job, please see the most wanted positions on INDEED or Monster. Unlike most of illegal immigrants that steal the low-paid jobs, OPT Students spend couples of grands on their education that benefit the income of a lot of colleges and make a tremendous contribution to the arising IT and High-tech industries that nowadays are main source of government's tax income.
For those who think STEM accept low salary in order to stay here, although there is no minimum wage for OPT workers, please notice OPT STEM students can only work for no more than 2.5 years. How many employers would spend such valuable time and money training on an employee who can only work for 1 or 2 years. Most of OPT students who wants to work after OPT visa have to apply for H1B, which require a minimum wage for the applicants. The minimum wage for foreign workers are usually higher than the average wages on the market (please refer to http://www.flcdatacenter.com/). Actually, employers surely want to hire American worker if there is enough qualified candidates.
Highly skilled foreign students are elites from all over the world. OPT program are their start point to realize the American dream, more importantly, it's the first door open to thousands of American companies that looking for competitive employees in nowadays high-tech era.
