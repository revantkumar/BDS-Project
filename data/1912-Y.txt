K Naito I have to disagree with what the government wants to do by increasing funding for non-U.S. citizens to receive an education in the U.S., while they barely support current citizens who will actually help our country. These F-1 students receive benefits that taxpayers pay for but they only use the education and on-the-job training that they receive to go back to their country and not directly help the U.S... According to the proposed regulation they state that this will help our country while they are here receiving an education and working for companies. I only see this as a short-term solution to something that could be a long-term solution when they could invest into people who are staying in the U.S... We already have a large amount of diversification with the current amount of people who are U.S. citizens.
