First of all, I strongly support this rule. Surprisingly I see a lot of folks are anti-immigration which is not how this country was bulit by our founding fathers. Plus those high-tech workers with STEM degree are LEGAL, not like someone acrossing the border with drugs coming in. Wake up, people, the key of how we success is we accept high talented people from all over the world.
