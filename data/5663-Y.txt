Practical experience is a very important part of education. As a college student, every time I go to listen to career talks by career advisers and employers, the importance of internship experience is always greatly emphasized, because it helps to provide an outlook to the work that students will encounter in their future endeavors, to get students started in developing skills at an early point in their career, and to guide students in planning their studies.

However, short term internship does not give the complete picture of the industry that a student would like to engaed in. This is why many STEM companies offer "rotation programs" that let college graduate to be involved in different area of their business in a hands-on fashion. These programs often last for at least 2 years to ensure that graduates have a comprehensive view of the industry, which will allow these graduates to become industry leaders quickly.

On the other hand, for students who has a strong career focus, such as graduate students, projects can be quite long. In my studies for master in mechanical engineering, most STEM research grants that I have seen involve 2 to 3 years of time (through several phases) to arrive at a sound conclusion. This is true for industries research projects as well. Many Engineering research and development managers that I have spoken to expressed that it is common for these projects to takes 5 years to be abble to apply to products for customers.

From these personal experience, I am very convinced that the proposed STEM OPT Extension, with its improved procedural oversight and renewed emphasis on mentoring/training in hands-on environment, is a necessary part of students education that allow sufficiently long practical experience.
