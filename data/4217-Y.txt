I think this rule will benefit both the students and the US, especially in maintaining the US's science and technology competitive in the future world.
For students, they will have a bigger chance to receive professional training outside of classroom to consolidate their knowledge and expertise. For this country, research labs and high-tech industry will have a bigger pool to select qualified employees, given that domestic students are less and less willing to study STEM degrees which require intensive intelligence and effort input. To sum all, the US has to attract talented international students to keep its competitiveness.
