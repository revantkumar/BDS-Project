Stephen Lu Everyone deserves an American dream. Especially these foreign students, you cannot image how much effort they have taken in order to survive in such a racist industry world. American was built on immigrants, the advanced technologies are maintained by these best and brightest international talents. If Opt, and H1b become unavailable to American educated international students, the American education would end up becoming a scam and American dream would just be a dream.
