Zao Yang I support this extension. This opportunity gives international students more time to have better experience in the most industrialized country for sure. This opportunity helps students to be prepared for further jobs no matter where they would go, thus it will make the experience of study abroad in the United States to be more competitive comparing to similar experience in other countries. In long term it will help to build deeper international communications between American students and their peers from other countries. In addition, in long term it will also help to develop the market of study abroad in America, which also helps local economy in many ways as we already seen now. More specifically, for most STEM research projects, it requires 2-3 years to accomplish. This extension is very reasonable for STEM students.
