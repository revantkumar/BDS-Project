In general, I support this rule. First of all, OPT training is not for ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT. Everyone under this program is entering this country legally and pursuing their American dreams. Secondly, if you think American people is smart enough, why the CEO of Microsoft or Google is not Mike or John. I quoted the following sentence from Donald Trump.

"Invite foreigners graduating from college to stay in US Our country's leaders are just so plan stupid. As an example, foreign students come over to our colleges, learn everything there is to learn about physics, finance, mathematics, and computers, and graduate with honors. They would love to stay in this country, but we don't allow them to. We immediately ship them back to their country to use all of the knowledge they learned at the best colleges in the United States back in their country rather than keep it here in ours. When we have gifted people in this country we should cherish them and let them stay. But instead we fling our arms wide open to the lowlifes, the criminals, the people who have no intention to contribute to our country. Wouldn't it be better if we invited foreign student graduating from our colleges to stay to build American companies, instead of foreign companies that will be wreaking havoc against Boeing, Caterpillar, and many other of our great American companies in the future?"
