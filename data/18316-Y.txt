In fact, many people who criticized on this proposal have no knowledg about how job market is working nor why economy rebounds after the crisis. There are jobs which americans are willing to do and ones which americans do not want to do or are not able to do. Who will do those work which americans do not want to do? Robots? Artificial Intelligence? What about those american are not capable of? Mess it up? Screw it? 
OPT students will not take any americans' jobs. In contrast, this act even gives companies chances to take advantages of new international graduates, because they are low-paid but hardworking!
As to economy, the first thing we can observe is that international students on OPT contribute a huge amount of tax every year. On a higher level, which a lot of americans are not aware of, they are the boost engine of science, engineering, fundamental disciplines, and technology of future(which is exactly STEM short for). United States needs to attract more talented young people to this land and make a better world for the human being. Without these passionate and brilliant student, US will gradually lose its leading position in the world!
Protesters, think about this. When this country loses its leading position, what kind of life will you face? Do NOT regret your decision when that happens!
