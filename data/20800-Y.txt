I totally agree with this regulation for the reasons followed:

1. American people should give every one equal chances to compete for the job, which can improves the competitive power of native Americans as well. the talent foreigners deserve these chance. They gain knowledge, study hard and fight greatly for the jobs, with no shortcuts or privileges.If we shut them out of the door, we are losing the spirit of cooperation and innovation. We are losing competitiveness in the world.

2. Talent foreigners can increase the economy for America.

3. If we do this, more good foreign students can be attracted to study in America and therefore increase the economy for us.They can share their unique ways to solve the problem, helping us a lot. 

Giving foreign students chances is giving chances to ourselves!

I strongly agree with it.
