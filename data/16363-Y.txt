Being a STEM student, I am strongly supportive for this regulation, considering that it would benefit both of the student as well as the employer for many factors:
As to the student, many good students are planning to work a short period(varies from 1 to 3 years), in the United States and then return to their home country, the extension of the OPT would let more students do that without applying for the H1B, it not only facilitate those students but also is a relief for others who want to work for a long period of time since they have less competitor during the lottery for the H1B visa.
And for the employer, the extension of OPT gives the employer especially those employer that do not have enough fund to sponsor H1B visa, the access to more F1 students, thus enable them to provide better products/services to the society. For those who already sponsor H1B, the extension of OPT would save them the fund for students who only want to work for short time.
Considering above points, extension of OPT bring many benefits to students and the employers, I sincerely hope that you could consider pass this regulation.
Thanks for reviewing!
