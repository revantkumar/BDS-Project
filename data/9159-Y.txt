I support this amendment. The reasons are as follows:

1. Gaining work experience after graduation is a major attraction for international students to pursue advanced degrees in U.S. More practical training opportunities will serve as an incentive to encourage more students to study in U.S., which shall lead to more vibrant cultural and academic atmosphere and benefit the U.S. universities financially.

2. STEM graduates offer competitive and abundant human resources for high-tech companies. OPT extension in no ways means more immigrants. But rather, it's a win-win solution for high-tech industry and international students.

Thus, I strongly support this amendment.
