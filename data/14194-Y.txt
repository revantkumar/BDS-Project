I think this new proposal for the stem opt extension is extremely important to both opt student bodies and those tech focused companies. Cancellation of this extension will, all of sudden, haul stem students' career path and career learning process, which will also inevitably hurt the employers in many ways. Due to the cap limit for H1B visa, most of the participants will not be able to win the "lottery" for just once, this new extension really helps to release some pressure from the H1B side. I sincerely hope that this proposal can be passed and all qualified STEM opt students and employers can benefit from it. Thank you.
