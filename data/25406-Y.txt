I fully support this proposal since if we cancel the extension, we are indeed killing the important part of technology innovation and these international students who benefit from advanced education in the United States will prompt the economic flourish in other countries, leading to more global competitors. Besides, according to the survey, compared with others, these students who have a good knowledge on STEM are more inclined to starting their own business which actually can bring more job opportunities and lower the overall unemployment rate in the USA.
