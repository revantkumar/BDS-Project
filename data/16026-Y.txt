I totally support this rule. This will benefit all the foreign students that have come all the way to US from so many thousand miles to study and have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars for that. Also this will benefit America since these students are going to help American companies grow and in turn help America grow. Also they will be paying taxes, buying goods and start new companies after few years and create employment which all will help America. Most of all these students have spent so much of their time and money to get educated in this country and deserve working here.
