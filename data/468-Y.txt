I Strongly support this regulations. This regulation can benefit both the Americans and the international students. First of all, many employers would like to employ the good international students since they are hard-working and smart. With the help of international students, United States of America will become stronger and stronger. Second, the international students also have rights to pursue their dreams and obtain the job opportunity they want. Moreover, as I know, the students who come to the United States are also the best students in their countries. They deserve the good jobs because they create much more value. I will be happy if the regulations pass and this really help USA stands on the top of the world!
