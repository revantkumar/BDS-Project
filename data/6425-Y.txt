Michelle Sharp This rule is not taking away any job from us. In fact because of this rule more and more jobs are being created for American citizen with or without degree in STEM field. I think this is a great step by DHS which would definitely promote new inventions and innovations in field of science and technology. STEM-related disciplines are responsible for many of the societal innovations that make our world better. Based on the experience of last few decades, F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM major indeed did a great contribution to America economics growth specially in technology and engineering fields. They brought creative ideas, developed fancy softwares which are popular in the whole world and inspired US companies about how to do business across the entire world. This rule will strengthen the relationships between America and other countries. That is, they can share more information, more resources and more opportunities.
