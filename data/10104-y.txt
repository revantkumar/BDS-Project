Toni Milstead I work at a university and see American students graduating that cannot find jobs. The logic of giving big companies tax breaks to undercut our young citizens getting jobs is in a word.... insane. These companies have plenty of money to pay decent wages to American workers. The greed has got to stop.

When we hire foreign faculty we must prove we are NOT taking advantage of them by paying them less than American faculty with similar experience and qualifications. It seems to me we need some consistency with our laws.

It's my understanding the The Department of Homeland Security and Customs Enforcement Bureau's are supposed to be protecting American citizens. This seems counter to that.
