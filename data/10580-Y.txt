In my opinion, the 24 months extension is necessary and important to the U.S. and also to the international students. 
Because for international students, finding a job is actually not that easy as compare with the U.S. citizens. There are two possible reasons will make a company to hire an international student, one is the student is very excellent, the other one is the company is short of employees and needs someone to get the work done immediately. 
In the first year the students get hired, most companies will train them for several months even almost a year. If the OPT could not get extended, the students could only work for one year, this means the company will lose a fully trained and experienced employee after one year and have to hire someone else and do the training again. This is apparently not a good deal for the company.
According to these reasons, the OPT extension is very necessary. 
It's not only a good way to keep excellent people, but also good for the U.S. companies and economy.
