I strongly support this new rule. First of all, skilled immigrants comtribute their knowledge and skills to corporations and the community. They are the fresh blood from all over the world, and they come to America because they believe she is a great country to work for. America becomes the greatest country in the world because of her diversity and multiculturality, and she would never become a conservative, anti-immigration nation. Meanwhile, it is totally irresponsible to blame skilled immigrants, especially STEM students for unemployment in U.S. Skilled international workers help U.S. corporations thrive in international competition, and they contribute to the competitiveness of the United States. Therefore, they actually bring jobs to U.S., rather than take them away from natives, especially given the historically low unemployment rate now.
