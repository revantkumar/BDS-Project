Employers should be given incentives to employ American students first and disincentives to employ foreign students.

If this country cannot provide sufficiently qualified students of its own then surely that tells the educators of this country they are not doing their duty!

Furthermore a President who thinks he can introduce such a scheme and bypass not only 'We The People' but the students of 'We The People' has no business running the highest office in the land.
