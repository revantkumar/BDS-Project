I personally think the OPT extension is extremely beneficial and indispensable to the US high tech companies and universities because:
1) New college graduates(NCG) usually has an open mind and the urge to innovate, this property is vital to high tech companies.
2) For the NCGs to make even the slightest impact on the company, 12 months is definitely not enough. First of all, there is so much to get familiar with inside a high tech company in order to get productive. Second and most importantly, writing and maintaining a piece of software usually takes years; if a student leaves US before he/she's able to finish writing his/her "baby", it's very likely that his/her work won't be continued by others.
3) If high tech company knows that its new hire is only going to stay for a short period of time, it's likely that the company will decide not to hire the graduate to begin with. Which not only will make it hard for STEM new graduates to land a job but also make it hard for companies to hire talents, which is detrimental to the high tech industry.
4) The previous fact will definitely dissuade foreign students to come to the US to receive higher education, which as a result will have a negative impact on the universities.
