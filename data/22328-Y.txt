Please add DMD (Doctor of Dental Medicine) and DDS (Doctor of dental surgery) degrees to the list of STEM designated degrees. There is a grave shortage of dentists in the US and barely any dentists to take care of the population especially in the rural areas. DMD/DDS has been on the suggested STEM degree list since 2011 but still not on the list. It is unfortunate if an international student cannot get an opportunity to work and serve the people here in US, after studying so hard and for such a long time to earn the dental degree and license . Therefore please add dentistry to the STEM degree list so that they can avail the benefits of STEM opt extension as well.
