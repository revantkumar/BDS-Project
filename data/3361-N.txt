We need to take care of American citizens first.I know plenty of people in the science and technology fields,that are unable to find work.We have enough people in this country that are either in these fields or would be interested in pursuing a career in these fields, if the opportunity presented itself.I believe we should be putting our energy into helping them.We need to take care of our own citizens first.
