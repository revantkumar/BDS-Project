Let's forget about the American Dream and focus on what makes a country competitive. The secret always lies in great talents. The expansion is not going to steal American's jobs but to CREATE numerous goods jobs and potential businesses in the U.S. F-1 Students with STEM Degrees are not those who compete for the construction or sales work; They are those who attain the best training in the world with possible patents or potential billion-dollar ideas. If the U.S. can't keep and utilize these talents, other countries will.
