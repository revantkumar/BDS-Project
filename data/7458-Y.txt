As a employee working in high tech company, I strongly SUPPORT this OPT extension act for international students US. My point of view is purely from management level of high tech companies.

I do believe my company and other companies in our industry will never consider a candidate's race, gender and nationality as a measurement when we recruit people. Our goal and faith is based on equity and diversity. We believe every human being on this plant has equal right to enjoy as well as contribute to our service and techniques to improve everyone's life. So we can see new grad students who are from India, China, Taiwan, Europe and many other different regions of this world are working, talking, laughing on our campus. They displayed their talent and continuously contribute their innovations and efforts.

But I do also know that they are not free to work with us. Some of them have trouble with their working permission expiration so we cannot delivery them a long-term task. Some of those new grads student have to turn down startup company's offers because start-ups cannot provide better support for their working permission. That must be a HUGE LOSS for the whole high-tech industry. We spend a lot of time to deal with those irrelevant things and we have to go through those troubles like losing great employees and team members.

So from my personal point of view, providing international students longer period of time to work in US is really practical and meaningful. Because most of long-term projects in our company should be worked for about 24 months to 36 months. This extension act is perfectly solving those problems. And also, we could have more time to face production related problems rather than human resources. Start-ups are able to attract more talents so that the whole industry would be more active and innovative.
