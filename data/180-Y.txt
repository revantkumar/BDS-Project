Pengyu Long I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. International students obtaining graduate school degrees in the US universities in area of STEM has always contributed significantly to the sustainable growth of US economy.

High-tech companies, for example, plays an important role in today's US economy growth. Recruiting international students with advanced graduate degrees has become routine practice in such industries. These grad students, though in relatively small numbers, contributes significantly in such industries.

2. Employing international students for only up to 3 years will NOT take the jobs away from US citizens, as it is still required in H1B visa application that only when no US citizen is available can such position to offered to international students. 

Furthermore,the need for highly-qualified employees in industry still outnumbers the US citizens with similar backgrounds. Restricting such positions will only result in failure to hire enough qualified employees for industries related to STEM field. 

3. This proposal is crucial in keeping US job market open and competitive. The inflow of hard-working workforce from other nations has always contributed to US economy in centuries. If this proposal is not passed, it may give the wrong signal that US is no longer the nation that welcomes hard-working workforce as it used to. Attracting highly-qualified and hard-working employees to US will become harder and harder, eventually jeopardizing the future of US economy.
