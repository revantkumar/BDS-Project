As we have more and more international students studying in STEM areas every year, especially from India, and the IT industry and market keeps growing and demand more tech people, while the amounts of lottery for H1B doesnt change much each year, international students need longer time to effectively obtain their H1B visa in order to contribute to STEM area companies/entities/corporations in United States. Therefore, I think this rule is beneficial to both the United States and international students studying in STEM areas.
