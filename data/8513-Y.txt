Dear Sir or Madam,

I am definitely supporting to the enhanced rule for stem OPT extension even though it will not give a benefit back to me now. 

I gained my EE master in US last year. As far as I know, the students who can get the stem OPT extension have to be qualified by a lot of restrictions. For example, the company should have its power and potential to be in the list for US. Thus, these would direct a number of elites who will be contribute to the country in the future.

We all know US as a genius heaven. Because of its excellent research environment and such policies, great inventions and new marketing emerge to provide more new jobs and better life to the whole community.

On the otherside, the veto to this policy is a termination for these employments due to the Cap-Gap of H1B visa. It will also be a termination to high level scientist researches. It will also give a loss to US companies to wait for a suitable person with high technique and research abilities to finish their projects.

myself, for sure, I will feel very sad because I have to stop my meaningful work here. To company, it is also an inevitable loss of excellent people who can bring great idea to the company and can break through the limitation of technology. 

In all, to keep these excellent students with their contributions to US, an extension for OPT-stem is very necessary to the whole country.

Thanks for your reading,
