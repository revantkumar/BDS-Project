I am an international student and I am working with Caterpillar under OPT status. US has always been my choice of pursuing my BS degree over other great countries like British and Canada because of the one year OPT after graduation and 17 more months OPT-extension if majoring in STEM. OPT-stem is one of the biggest reasons students outside the U.S is coming oversea and paying huge amount of tuition for school. It also makes college degree in the states more valuable than any other countries. 

If the regulation doesn't get approved, U.S will loss significant amount of international students which means a dramatic financial impact on both private and public universities. That causes decline in the quality of education and tuition raise. Let's look at an example, illinois state has been cutting educational budges on all the universities, most of the universities chose to accept more international students to even the budget cut. Therefore, I strongly support the proposal and hope it can get approved.
