Yiting Zheng I strongly think STEM extension should be approved because it would attract more students to study in the US since they will be given more time to explore their interest. The current time period for STEM is too limited to allow any extensive exploration and the extension is necessary not only for international students but also for the sake of American companies, which could benefit from the extension by having a wider choice of their employees.
