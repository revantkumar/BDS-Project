Jason Huo I strongly SUPPORT the STEM extensions, considering following aspects. 
1.Countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Taiwan, and China are actively instituting new strategies to attract international students.If OPT extension for the STEM students is canceled. It will decrease the enthusiasm of the international student to come to US to take a further study.Moreover, they will turn to the other country who have the better strategies for international student.Which means that america will retard the steps of developing science, technology and economy.

2. Foreign students, for example, regularly contribute a significant amount of money into the U.S. economy. According to statistics compiled by the Association of International Educators (NAFSA), foreign students made a net contribution of $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy in the 2013-2014 academic year This contribution included tuition ($19.8 billion) and living expenses for self and family ($16.7 billion), after adjusting for U.S. financial support ($9.7 billion). And public colleges and universities particularly benefit from the payment of tuition by foreign students, especially in comparison to the tuition paid by in-state students.Most importantly, those STEM students all experienced high education in the U.S.. They are LEGAL TAX PAYERS and very self-disciplined. They contribute to the economy as much as, if not more, than the most U.S. citizens.

Therefore, I strongly support this new policy.
