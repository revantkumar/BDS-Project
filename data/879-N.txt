Just what we need, more help for foreign students. Sounds like real Homeland Security to me. What we need is more help for our own LEGAL U.S. students.

It has been shown that more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013 have been denied to American workers and that OPT has removed over $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. This program is not only bad for U.S. students it is bad for the country and our senior citizens. To expand such a program is just down right stupid. However, it does fit in with the clown type politics coming from Washington under Obama.
