The 12-month OPT time is very limited for a STEM students. In my personal case, my summer internship has taken up 3 months' time. The remaining 9-month is far from enough for employers to see me as a valuable employee candidate because I wouldn't be able to work for a long enough period of time after receiving proper training from the company. The extension is therefore crucial for STEM majors as well as the firms in which are hiring STEM majors. The firms are those who make up the US economy, and thus the extension would increase everyone's welfare.
