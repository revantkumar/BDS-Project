I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should make the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and keep making contributions to the U.S.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S, lots of people who achieved great accomplishments in U.S were international students such as the famous scientist Chen-Ning Franklin Yang.

3.Competition can strongly filter excellent and tanlented persons for the U.S. No matter the local or international students, as long as they have solid knowledge, they can boost American global competitiveness.
