I don't think the international students come to the US at the expense of American's taxes. Instead, they contribute a huge amount of money to our college system as well as the local economy. Per my understanding, many of them are self-supported, they don't spend one cent of the taxes we paid at all. Usually, they pay 5 times more tuition fees than local students do. Without their money, I'm afraid many of our colleges may be closed. It sounds so sad, but it's true. Even though they work in the STEM field, they still pay taxes just as the citizens do. I don't see why we should force them all to leave...
