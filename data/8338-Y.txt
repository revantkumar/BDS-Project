Having the most talented genius from around the world to build better America is really good. People who oppose this have no idea how much money we get from international students every year, how much contribution these international talents made to IT companies. Silicon Valley need them, America need them. People who make bad excuse to stop the new regulations. Shameful!!! I believe my kids also want to have them in America longer than three years.
