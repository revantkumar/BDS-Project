I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international electrical enginering master student from China. OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. If this rule is terminated by some reasons, it will bring a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents.

As I'm a Chinese STEM student, I would finally return to China rather than stay in US. Before then, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech industry development. If I have about 3 years work experience in US, I would be competitive in the job market of China. That's why this new OPT rule would benefit both US high-tech industry and international STEM talents.

Hope more people support this good rule!
