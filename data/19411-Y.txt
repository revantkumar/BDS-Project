It is a wise decision to extend OPT for stem F1 student. These international students pay their tuitions and also hold US. degree. I think they deserve to have a fair opportunity to compete for a job, at least for a stem job. It proves that those guys are talented in engineering and science and they contributed a lot to the development of US. economy. If America wants not to come to a halt for their economy and science they need to hire the most talented guys in this field.
