Changlei Shi As a CS guy, I can tell the huge process of IT in United States these years. Behind this prosperity, the feat comes from numeric IT foreign employees in STEM field. IT companies are in lack of employees to create marvelous technics and amazing services so that the local employees cannot meet the demand of market. This is why we are needed. No one, nor organization can decide who should be employed but the market. We, as a group of STEM students being professional and passionate in our major fields, are working so hard to help this country grow faster and stronger. We are not competitors but the co-workers.
