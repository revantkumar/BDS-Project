I strongly support the proposed rule to improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 Non-immigrant students with STEM degrees and CapGap relief for all eligible F-1 students.
I am an F-1 student and it would be great for students like me to gain some practical experience in U.S to better understand and fully apply our academic research work to the industry. It is very necessary to modify and extend the OPT extension period to 24 months or even longer.
