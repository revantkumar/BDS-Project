I strongly support this new rule of STEM OPT extension. 

The 24-month extension is necessary for STEM student to receive enough practical training in their jobs. For example, the pharmaceutical company I am at now would usually require more than 18 months to complete one phase of clinical trial. The delay or termination of a project due to time limit is a loss for both the company and the international employee. The new rule ensures that international students can receive enough professional training and also have good career development in the future, which in return is a good repayment for the US school's educational input. I believe similar situation happens in other industries as well. The new STEM OPT rule is beneficial for the career development of international employees and the companies themselves.
