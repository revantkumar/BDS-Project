Shuangjing Liang I support the extension for the OPT.
International students make up the majority of STEM majoring students nowadays. These students are the main force for science and technology industries. They have made huge contributions to these fields. An OPT with decent length will allow them sufficient time to actually finish something in their field. If OPT allows an international student to only have one chance to apply for H1B visa, the employer would suffer from unnecessary loss by recruiting a replacing employer. This is a one-time shot for the employee; meaning that the employer only has one shot at acquiring this employee.
Also, for an international student, the willing to work in US has nothing to do with willing to immigrate. By working for a couple of years in US, some international communications which will probably not be achieved so well by other ways will be achieved here. This will be beneficial to US. As long as the immigration rules and laws are still strict, there will be really limited influence on immigration. 
Thank you for your time.
