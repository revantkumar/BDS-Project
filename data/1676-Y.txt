I strongly support the OPT extension proposal base on the following reasons:

1. It's great to welcome talented young people all over the world to come to US and contribute to science, technology, and research field. It will improve the development progress of human society and keep the U.S to be in leading position in these fields compared with other countries.

2. STEM international students brings lot of benefits to the whole country. They bring money to universities so that these could be used as funding to be applied in research or improve the facilities. Also, in order to serve for these students, universities open many programs to cater for them, and this provides working opportunities for teaches, lecturers. Similarly, these students have great impact on other industry such as tourism, catering, business, and it's a big incentive to national economy. 

3. Research has shown that foreign students who earn a degree and remain in the United States are more likely than native born workers to engage in activities, such as patenting and the commercialization of patents that increase U.S. labor productivity.
