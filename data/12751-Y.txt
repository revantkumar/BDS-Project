I am currently working in a high tech company. I was on my opt for one year and luckily I got my H1B in the first year. So I didn't use the STEM extension. However, I'd like to express my opinion that OPT extension is very necessary and critical for not only the international students, but also the companies, even the America economy.

First, the STEM students will NOT take opportunities from domestic STEM workers. For example, my current job requires the applicants could speak the language where the factory locating. We could speak our native language and also english. However, for most of Americans, they cannot meet this requirement. The international students could play a very good role here. We work as a bridge in between and there are no barriers, which is more effecient and effective. We help the company the expend and expedite the business in other countries.

Second, with the STEM extension, the companies will NOT have high risks to lose the technical people. If I failed to get my H1b and OPT extension, my company has to find another person to do my job. It will be another round of hiring, training, and so on. It will involve a lot of duplicated work. The worst scenarios may be the project get cancelled, which definitely will have impact on the company's benefits.

So, from thousands of high tech companies' stand point, the STEM extension is very critical and necessary.
