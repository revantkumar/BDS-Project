I support this proposal since this can help with the economy of the US. A lot of US large companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft hire a lot of international new college graduate student for the entry level jobs. These people contributes a lot in products and also tax. The companies often spend a lot of time to train these employees. If OPT can only support these people for one year, the companies needs to hire and train other people to do these entry level work, which is a large overhead. For these new graduates, they also have a longer time to do practical training in their fields, which attracts more international intelligent people to come and study in the US, which will also contribute to the country.
