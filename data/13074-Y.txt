I think this extension will give lots of benefits to the USA.
1. It will help the USA to have more potential in attracting talented young people to stay in the USA. As I know, the average age in a lot of laboratories of Chinese Academy of Science is blow 40, those young scientists have lanched space ships, built aircraft carriers etc. What will happen if these young talented people can work for the USA?
2. It will be an opportunity to stimulate young generation of the USA. They now have more competitors, which will make them work much harder than before. When I go to the library in our school, lots of students there just open their laptop and chat with each other, they are doing everything except studying. 'B is enough' is the comment I hear the most. If they know that they won't have a job because the company have provided work for lots of grade A international students, will they work harder?
