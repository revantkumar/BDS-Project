From my own study and work experience, I definately think OPT extension will benefit the country. I strongly believe that allowing international students to prosper in the US would bring in far more jobs than the number saved by driving them out. 

As far as I know, majority of the foreign student who can find a job and gain OPT extension graduated from CS/Accounting/Actuarial Science major.I graduated from one of the above major which ranked top 3 in US. As I am reaching out to the alumnis during job hunting, I realize most of the alunmis are playing an irreplaceable role in the company that they work for. And I myself is hoping to do the same thing in the future as well.

To extend the OPT will definately provide international students more opportunities to work in the country, which will benefit US in the end. At the same time, the extension will never hurt current US native student.90% of the student within my graduate colleage program are foreigners. And foreinger students have higher average GPA and better academic performance than native US student. But when it comes to job hunting, US student do have advantage as native speaker. Eventhough the resumes of US student are less competitive, they got more job offer from the top companies within the industry. And before graduation, US student tend to land a job earlier than international student.
