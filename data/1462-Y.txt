I would like to object to implementation of the proposed regulation. My reasons are many, but I can summarize my primary reasons rather quickly. We currently have a sever problem in this country with unemployed and more to the point under employed American workers. This problem is particularly acute in the information technology sector. My son in law received training in this field and was near the top of his class, however he has not been able to find employment in this field since completing his training some seven years ago.

The son of a close friend graduated from Texas A&M four years ago near the top of his class with a degree in information technology and he has been unable to find an entry level full time position in his chosen field. He spends his time as an underemployed IT consultant setting up systems for small company's on a part time basis.

Both of the individuals I have given as my examples are struggling, due in part to our government's inexplicable policy of importing citizens of other countries rather than attempting to employ our own work force.

I think our government should insure that all of our students who are citizens are gainfully employed before we attempt to implement a policy like the one proposed. And lastly, I would like to point out that major policy changes like the proposed regulations should be passed as a law by the congress, and not an expansion or convoluted interpretation of existing regulations.

Thank you for considering my comments.
