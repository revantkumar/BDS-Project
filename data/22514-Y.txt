That is great for all people who wanna come to U.S and pursue their dreams here, the same as the founders of this nation hundred years ago. Only more open to the smartest people, America would still maintain the greatest country on this planet, especially in science, otherwise, it is destined to fall. 

I fully support this new policy, as it will open up gate to smart people, who surely will change the world, the way as Elon Musk, making contributions to human beings.
