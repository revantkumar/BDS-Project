Although non-immigrant students have OPT period to legally work in the United states, it is the truth that the company will choose American student rather than equal-qualified international students. Americans should not worry if your chances are taken away by foreigners. 24 months OPT extension will give the companies more time to decide if they really want to keep the students based on their skills, not their nationalities. Also give the company enough time to apply working visa for the employees to keep the skilled, well-trained workers. OPT is a huge beneficial method for the United States to gather all the professional, skilled young generation who have the influence on the world evolution in hands. Every country in the world is using some ways to keep valuable STEM students. OPT and OPT extension give more benefits to the country and companies than the individual. Use your rights wisely.
