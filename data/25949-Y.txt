I am STRONGLY agree this proposal. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. I am firmly believe this diverse atmosphere helps nurture a strong workforce. Also, Competition does exist, but STEM students who are working in U.S. are utilizing their knowledge to facilitate the U.S. economy that will help everyone live better lives.
