Brina Wang I strongly support the proposed expansion of the optional practical training (OPT) program. This is really helpful for U.S. for it will help the talented young people stay longer and contribute more to the country. Also, U.S. is having more and more project involved with other country. All of these talented young people who are born with a bilingual ability can absolutely contribute a lot in all of these cooperation which is really helpful for the future development of U.S.
