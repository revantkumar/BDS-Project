Dear the U.S government,

I am writing this comment to strongly request you to reconsider this petition. This petition is 100% unfair to all other international students who study "not a Stem" major. For all of the reasons people listed below mentioning that it's good for students to have longer practical training, then this petition should apply for "ALL internationals students". Otherwise, the petition only benefits for a very small group of us. I and my friends chose the U.S to study and have paid hundreds thousand dollar for the U.S government because we believe we are and will be given the same opportunities from the country(I say opportunities, not rights), but now it seems that the U.S government is considering to take away what brought us here from the beginning. Please reconsider the consequences to your economy as the U.S may be no longer a "number one in list country" which intl students will choose. 

For whom who think that this benefit for high tech company and good for the economy because they need more people working in data field or CS field, for example. Not necessarily. I am studying Public Policy Analysis and I am confident to manipulate or analyze data like any other some Stem majors can. I and my friends even ask for lower salary than other CS majors people do. However, I can only have 12 months of OPT because my major is not listed in "STEM" majors. Dear everyone, you know that the name does not say it all, but how you know the tools and techniques matters. 

For whom who say that I'm jealous of STEM people. I am applying to grad school and major in "STEM" just because I like it and it fits my dream. Even in the case when I get a STEAM major after I graduate, I will not support this petition no matter what because it is very unfair to all international students, to your peers. Imagine one day, there is a petition that give graduate students 48 months of practical training, what will you react? Put yourself in other's shoes, PLEASE!
