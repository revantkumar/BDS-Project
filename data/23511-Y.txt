Do you know U.S. company prefer to hire native American rather than a foreigner? If a foreigner can get a job offer, he/she must be top tier among his/her peers. And most of the company hiring STEM students are high-tech company.It is a win-win-win situation for the person, company and country.
a) The company can hire excellent people to fulfill the job at a relatively low cost. And by doing this , the U.S. company can stay among the top companies all over the world.
b) By drawing talent people all over the world to U.S., the U.S. government can maintain its leading position. So we don't fall behind China or Russia.
c) The person can achieve his/her personal goal and feels welcome. So he/she would like to work for U.S. and provide good quality of work for a long time.
All in all, I strongly support the proposal!
