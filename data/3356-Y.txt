I am in favor of the rule to extend OPT program.

The qualified international students who legally work for the American tech company not only make plenty of profit to the economy but also create much more jobs than the numbers saved by driving them away. 

Simply driving these students out of the country immediately after their graduation is shortsighted. Stopping extension of OPT program may reduce the number of competitors in the job market in a short term. This would be at the cost of long term interest.The relief would quickly be meaningless if the industry without new blood failed to keep growing. The worse case is that a sudden lack of labor may cause much more outsourcing. Since the companies are always trying to keep their growth.It would be a truly disaster. 

International students' participation in the job market help the tech company to keep the growing and absolute competitiveness and leadership in the world which is vital to this country.

According to the rule, it is required for a international student to meet a salary standard which is much higher than the local minimum wage level. Then he or she can obtain h1b visa.
International students have nothing to do with lowering the minimum wage. And I think those one who has proved themselves already will make huge contribution to the society.

The valid period of OPT and the numbers of h1b visa per year is limited and totally under control. I don't think the international students should be to blame for such welfare and salary problem. 

According to my observation, the illegal worker ,h1b abuse and outsourcing are the main problems in the market. But the fact is that those one who take advantage of these three care nothing about OPT policy change. Stopping OPT extension does NOT help.
