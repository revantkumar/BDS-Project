I strongly support the OPT extension. There seems to be a huge misunderstanding of the type of skill level we are talking about here. There is a gross lack of skilled STEM graduates in the US while the pay scale is high/getting higher. If foreign students are stopped from competing and filling in the need for skilled STEM grads, US will very quickly lose its competence in the world market. Of course, if unfortunately the extensions are not granted, a large majority of these 'highly skilled STEM graduates' will go back to countries like China, India. US can cry then, when it's too late.

Again I stress its 'highly advanced STEM fields' that need foreign graduates. Giving them OPT extension will only boost the economy and create more jobs.
