if this rule were not to pass, universities in the states will be generally impacted, especially the non-top ranking ones. Everyone in the academia knows that these universities are largely supported by the exorbitant out-of-state tuition, which is 3~6 times higher than in-state tuition, paid by international students. Only if them pay more our own kids can pay less.
My Point Is 
Do not stop them coming in to pay (otherwise who bail out the debt), the OPT extension is the very useful fantasy to lure them in, stabilize them to finish their diploma. We have much more convenient (and unconspicuous) ways to kick them out, no OPT will just wake them up.
