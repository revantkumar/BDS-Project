I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international master student from China. Before I came to America, I had multiple options to pursue my master degree in USA, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and British. The most important reason I choose to study here is America could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with a better policy to foreign STEM talents. BTW, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. 
As I'm a Chinese STEM student and was born and living there, I would return back China eventually. Before then, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from American university to high-tech industry development. If I have about 3 years work experience in the USA, I would be competitive in the job market of China. That's why this new OPT rule would benefit both US high-tech industry and international STEM talents.

Hope more people support this good rule!
