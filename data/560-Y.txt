I saw some nonsense comments stating that the existent of foreign STEM students is driving down the wage on the market, and they are taking away American STEM students' jobs. 

That's not true. 

For a company to hire a foreign STEM student, it will have to pay extra labor and financial expense to cooperate with DHS and sponsor its employee for attorney fee. That's the main reason that many companies don't want to hire foreign students. 

I was a foreign student looking for job and I fully felt the taste of being turned down by many companies, not because you were unqualified but just because you were a foreigner. 

In this case if a foreign student can successfully get hired, he/she must be very competitive on the market. So for those American students not that competitive, you should really not complaint that other more talented people take your jobs away because those jobs are not belongs to you anyway. 

And that's why I fully support this proposal because it gives those talented foreign students a chance to apply what they have learned and become a contributor of American economy. American holds its leading position in the world for decades because it can attract the most talented and smartest people on earth to work for it. OPT extension will fully support the spirit of American Dream, and more.
