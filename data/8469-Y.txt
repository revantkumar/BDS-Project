I strongly support this regulation for the following reasons:

1. United States is a equal opportunity and the government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. For many year, international contribute to the U.S economy in many ways especially in the technology field.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. As we know, the silicon valley is such a diversity area. People from different parts of world work together and build today's legend of silicon valley. 

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Also, we should know the fact that U.S citizen always get the first priority. International students always work in the field that provide a lot of position and the U.S citizen doesn't provide enough candidates. Even for these type of jobs, U.S students are also at the first priority. The opt regulation restrict student working in the area related to their majors. Hence, there is no reason to accuse student take job from lot of workers form U.S citizen
