Xin Wan We need to look at how exactly this mechanism works:
1. It is the pool size of H1 visas, rather than the OPT length, that decides how many international students can stay eventually. Increasing the length significantly helps enterprises to have a better vision of their international employees and helps americans work with better selected group of international elites.
2. Given the pool size, it is the length of OPT that decides how your international colleagues look like. Do you want to have a lucky man with only 1 year of practical training or another well-trained professional to be your colleague? Remember the H1 visa pool, which decides how many international students can stay after the training, is to some extent independent from this extension.
3. America needs competitive employees to build competitive enterprises. This rule is set up for this great country which stays strong and prosperous with her openness and liberty spirit. Losing competitiveness could be fatal, just look at Detroit.
