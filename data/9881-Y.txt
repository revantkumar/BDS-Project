John He For hundreds of years, this country has been accepting immigrants from all over the places on earth. There is no essential natives, except American Indians. Although immigrants coming from different places may have different reason to stay here, most of them have the same goal, the American dream. No matter you are white, black, hispanic or asian, we come to this land hoping to start a brand new life. Why such liberal country now want to become conservative?

People may say immigrants bring many social issues, such as worse of security , social welfare, job opportunities. Plz ask yourself, are these issues really caused by immigrants? If you insist on immigrants bring these issues, then are these issues really brought by the immigrants which applied through OPT and OPT ext. Because we know for these holding OPT ext, they have STEM background. They are the elites of the society. Don't forget how US become the strongest country in the world. Without well policy to absorb high-tech people from other countries working together with US citizens, how can US possibly achieve this goal.
