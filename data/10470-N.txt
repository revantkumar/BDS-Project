If people are 'immigrating' to this country - like the many before them they had to prove they could support themselves. Now it seems it is a free for all. They come, we train them at tax payers expense, fire the citizens who had to train them. So that makes a citizen out of work and a non citizen in the citizen's job,. This is not to be borne by Amerians. Jobs for Americans first. Jobs for Veterans first. We must support the backbone of America and that is American Citizens - not just give it away because of weak policy from this W.H.
