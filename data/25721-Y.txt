I support the new proposal wholeheartedly. We students who come from other countries put in a lot of money in our masters program, I myself am paying 60 times the USD equivalent amount for my masters program. Extending the OPT will give us a chance to atleast earn back the invested money along with a good 3 years experience of the US market which is highly deemed worldwide. Also, this takes off the pressure of getting approved for H-1B visa which previously has been a risky business for us. 
Please pass the proposal considering the future of thousands of international student just like me.
