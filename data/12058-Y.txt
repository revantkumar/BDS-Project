I support this rule. 

The people objecting this rule is trying to impose a higher tariff on labor market import. In this case, the consumer is corporates in US, the "evil company" is the domestic labor. But this doesn't solve the problem. 

1. Corporations in US don't just succeed b/c they are born to. They are so b/c they hire smart, do business smart. This all relies on a free labor market. Free market has been and will always be the key to the US success. 

2. The consequence of lack of competition is that US corporations are forced to hire domestic students. And domestic students are very happy to secure a job even before they start their college. What happens then? They'll just spend their 4 years in Marijuana and party and get a decent job without any hardworking. 

I agree the jobs should be saved for hardworking Americans. But without decent competition, nobody is going to work hard.
