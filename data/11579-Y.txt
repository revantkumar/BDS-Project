Absolutely SUPPORT.

A 17-months extension to 24-months extension of OPT really makes no big difference. However this rule shows that US is a country of diversity.

Someone comments saying it would impact the rights of US citizen, which doesn't really make sense. As a US citizen, one could work for any employer, while international students with OPT can only work in a position that is closely relative to their majors (STEM), with only a limited time of unemployment period for job seeking. These restrictions still limit the threat from international students to US citizens.

Taking international students as threats to US citizen is an unconfident approach from my perspective.
