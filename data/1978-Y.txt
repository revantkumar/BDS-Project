First, the opt extension definitely eases the shortage of workers in STEM field.
Second, it attracts more international students to study in the US to promote the economic growth of the nation in all kinds of aspects.
Highly educated foreigners make a big impact in the industries and academic research in the fields like semiconductor, computer science and some other engineering fields.
