Zhongyue Zhang In the perspective of an international undergraduate student, I think majority of the public is not aware of the limitation F-1 students have during college compared to a local student, and therefore they don't see the increasing need of fair opportunities for F-1 students to fulfill their college education. 

During the completeness of college education, most student have off-campus career or internship to supplement their study of field. However, international students are not eligible to work off-campus. In their first and second years, they can only apply for on-campus jobs competing with local students in English fluency and public service experiences. Moreover, in their junior and senior years where everyone is looking for an internship or a summer program, they will find that the majority of internship or programs are only open to U.S. citizens because they are mostly funded by REU or NSF. For minority of those who do not require citizenship, they are not open to students from designated countries, which include China, Vietnam, etc. 

After graduation, needless to say that most interviews are not open to international students because it requires extra work and money to hire them. Even if they pass an interview luckily, they have to pick draws for a work visa with more luck. STEM international students cannot even work in the laboratories in their own schools. 

Therefore in summation of all above, I think the limitation STEM F-1 students have is so high through out their college and even higher after graduation, that they cannot fulfill and supplement their field of study as regular students. The extension of OPT can definitely help on this. In existence of limitations, longer OPT will grant them high chances to obtain work experiences or relative study experiences.
