I am strongly in support of expanding these training opportunities. These are excellently trained individuals who were schooled here and can contribute much to our STEM research and development so that the U.S. can continue to be a leader in this field. Moreover, living in the U.S. allows these people to know and understand our culture, which is perhaps the best way to encourage an amicable view of the U.S. from our global partners. It would be a real shame to force these people to leave who can contribute so much more and have already function well in our society.
