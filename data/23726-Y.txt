I am an international student who has a STEM major. Right now I am working as a Software Engineer at Bay Area. Based on my current situation, I would definitely in favor of this STEM OPT extension. 
From my perspective, this new rule will help us to work with OPT for almost three years, it is a great chance for new graduates to get familiar with the area they are working with. Moreover, it offers a bridge to help our international students apply the knowledge into the real industrial world, which is a necessary supply to strengthen the initial purpose of setting OPT training period. OPT extension is also really important for STEM students, since the learning curve for any technical based position is kind of higher than other non-tech ones, we do need more time to focus on improving ourselves during this training time and pay more attention on working itself.
From the perspective of my company, it is also beneficial for them. Once I heard from my HR, the average cost for each college new hire is around 10k, which actually shocked me for a long time. If the OPT STEM extension is revoked, and the international employees can no longer work at this country, it is indeed a huge loss for those companies who hire international employees as their majority. Unfortunately, most of the tech companies in Bay Area are the victims. So extending the OPT time is also a good workaround to improve high tech development and may even a strong support for the whole national economy. 
If it is a win-win solution, why not to approve it and make full use its benefits asap? Thanks for your kind consideration.
