I strongly support the extension to 24 months for the following reasons:

1, It would enhance the US education quality by incorporating more diversity. Diversity could bring a lot insights and different perspectives. Especially nowadays world is not isolated, it is crucial to bring people from different background to schools, workplaces and societies.

2, It would benefit US economy and increase the employment for domestic workers. For most of the OPT student employers, they would favor US citizens over international student. When there is a shortage of the US citizens that are qualified for certain jobs, they would then hire international students. This means it is not the OPT extension which "rob" the job opportunities away from US students. But rather, increase the overall efficiency of companies so that they could benefit the overall economy and create more job opportunities for domestic workers.

In summary, I strongly support the extension to 24 months because it would benefit the country and people and in additional, providing a short term practical training opportunities to the international students after they finish their studies.
