Min Hu I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S..

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. Being open and encourage different perspective has been a huge part of the American spirit. 

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. It pushes innovation, and it helps fill jobs where there's low supply.
