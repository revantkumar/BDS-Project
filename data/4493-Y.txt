I definitely agree with the proposed regulation. Because, it gives the opportunities to the F-1 Students to enhance their career development. In my country, an employee who has 2-3 years working experience in U.S can have more chances to find better positions. 

Also, many F-1 students are very excellent, they get scholarship and advanced educations from U.S, who can be a great resource for U.S development. The extended OPT will allow these students to make contributions to the U.S. society after their graduation.
