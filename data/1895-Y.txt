I support OPT expansion rule.
My opinion is there is no any impact against native American. Good job only for right man, not right nationality.

Reason1: F1 students who using OPT to get the full-time job, also pay the income taxes, the same as natives. They are doing contribution for this country. Native Americans also get benefits from this part of F1 students.

Reason2: This is also a good import pattern for getting hi-tech elites all round the world. This is the reason why America is the top of the world. 

Reason3: F1 students with OPT have the same opportunity as natives. This is fair for everybody, no matter what status you are. This is positive competition, it is good for a country to keep developing.
