I completely agree that the OPT extension goes as long as 24 months. In such case, more and more talents will stay the States after graduation instead of going back to his/her own country. You know, the H1B visa is not easy to get. So many applicators that almost each year it will be performed via lottery. If 24-month act is approved, international students will have one more time going into the H1B pool and so more likely to get H1B visa and work for US.
