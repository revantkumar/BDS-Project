1. The STEM gives nonimmigrant students the opportunity to work for a longer time in the US, helps bring more profit to American companies and contribute more tax to the nation.
It is a program that benefits all parties of the society.
2. At this moment, the H visa has a very limited quota for nonimmigrant students. And every year they have to go through a lottery for the chance of staying in the US. This shows the shortage of talents that American companies need. So the STEM gives American companies better chances to hire the talents they need.
3. More talented and educated nonimmigrant students working in the US would definitely help the economy and make more potential opportunities for the society.
