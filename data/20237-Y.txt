I strongly SUPPORT this move to extend OPT period. Presence of international students in the work force contributes very strongly towards the nations economy and makes our nation much better in all regards. Silicon Valley thrives bigger and better each day thanks to these F1 students and workers who are on OPT period. The American technology area is made better and more powerful thanks to the STEM students. We should extend their training period and opportunities so that we are benefited from their presence even more.
