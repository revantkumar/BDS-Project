Tristan Wang I STRONGLY SUPPORT this new rule for the following reasons:

1. US needs to grow its population at a steady pace, STEM immigrants are the best among all other immigrants as they are comparatively more intelligent overall all. 

2. Competition does exist but it does not cost US citizens their job. I have several friends who are US citizens, they have several offers in hand already. There are still many companies that hired US citizens or PRs only. Hiring international students is not going cost their jobs. 

3. This rule's exists because US government know that US needs it and it is more than clear.
