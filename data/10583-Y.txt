i think opt extension is very important and beneficial for not only international student but also US government. A longer time opt extension will be attractive to those students who has talents and a well finance support from their family to come to US to study. Those students will make a lots of contributions to US university academic research and also they will contribute to the economics of university and local city.
After they graduate, those students will output their effort to all kinds of technology company which can increase the competitiveness of US. Also the tax they pay is a big number which is a another benefit for US economy. But if opt extension is cenceled , all of those benefit will be lost.

so I support this new regulation of opt extension!
