Xiaoyu Ji I strongly support this proposal.

From a national sight, this proposal is significant for the whole economy system. Let's image how our economy would be without this proposal passed?
First the universities may not get enough applicants from other country, which is a big part of university financial system. Not enough fundings, not enough money. Without money, even American students can not get best education.
Then let take a look at companies. Nowadays a lot of foreign graduate start to open their own companies after OPT. This means a lot for Americans because in this way more jobs are opening for Americans. Those jobless people would get the chance to work which can makes them live better.

Also, if this proposal fails, the international relationship between America and other countries could somewhat be affected. It can be interpreted as a push-out policy. 

People who need OPT or OPT Extension are mostly young. They are the future of the world we should not stop them by all means, especially in this way.
