I STRONGLY SUPPORT this proposal for the following reasons:

1. These students have learned the most advanced knowledge from universities in the U.S., which are of the best universities in the world. Of course they should stay and make contributions to the country, otherwise the U.S. will just be training talents for others.

2. The U.S. is, and has always been, a proud country with its diversities. Just take a look at how many extraordinary achievements are made by international students before they stay here in the U.S.

3. These university graduates are looking for job opportunities that match their talent and expertise. They are not the major reason why some of the local residents cannot get jobs. Plus, a competition helps increase productivity of the workforce. It is always good to have a better workforce, no matter where they come from. The U.S. needs highly educated men to keep its competitiveness globally.
