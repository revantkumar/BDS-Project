I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international physics Ph.D student from China. OPT provides opportunities to international students like me to stay and keep pursuing physics while also making contribution to the American Academia after graduating through post-doc positions. Without OPT, I will have to go to other counties for post-doc and faculty positions. If OPT extension is cancelled, not only the personal plans of STEM students like me will be affected, but also the US scientific research will be greatly influenced as STEM students are now the driving force of US research, doing all kinds of "dirty" part of research on a relative low wage. Forcing the STEM students to leave US after graduation is a huge waste for the US society as they are making great contributions not only to scientific research but also to the economy, via all the creativity and novelty international students provide in various areas including lots of high-tech company and start-ups. By extending the OPT period, more talents can stay and make further contribution to US society, improving the research and economy, and thus benefit all US people.
