Vikram Rao I strongly support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. I believe this increased period of practical training is important for students to fully develop their skills and find employment opportunities here in the US. I think this would be a very critical step for foreign students who come here in the US to study and make a difference in lives of not only US Citizens but for the entire world. 

I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months because we need to give the best and the brightest students every opportunity to succeed in the U.S.
