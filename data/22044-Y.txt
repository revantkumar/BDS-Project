Strongly SUPPORT the proposal. 

During the past years, international students have made huge contributions to the innovation within USA during their OPT extension periods. 

If the OPT extension is cancelled, the situation is likely to change. US colleges would still take a lot of efforts to train international students. However, after graduation, the skilled people will leave from US. That will definitely affect the growth of numbers of companies, because it will not be much more difficult for the companies to find same-level skilled people.
