I support the OPT extension. 

This is no doubt a great benefit for international STEM students, giving them more flexibility in planning their career and future. 

The extension of OPT will not necessary lead to immigration influx. In fact, many international students have tight family bounds back in their home country and they do want to go back. For those who want to immigrate to US, the extension of OPT probably extends the number of years they have to wait before becoming a US citizen or even getting a green card, because employers have no reason to apply for H1B on behalf of their foreign employees if they can work legally using OPT for two years.

The extension of OPT will not necessary lead to fewer jobs for Americans. First of all, the competition within international students is much more fierce than between international and domestic students. Second, companies are looking for good employees who can bring value to their business. If international students are not allowed to work in the US, then I doubt many US companies will open branches outside of US where intelligent labors are cheaper, just like how manufacturers move to developing countries.

I think OPT extension is a win-win policy for both international STEM students and Americans.
