WHo do politicians really represent? Obviously not the working people. All politicians represents money....money that supports the lush jobs that they have. What a perfect job they have. Vote their own wages, vacations and benefits. All they have to do in return is bring more money into their party....thats it! The deep pockets pay for what they want the politicians to do for them. The gridlock in congress is over which party can earn the most money for their party by satisfying those that support them....deep pockets. Jefferson was right, the people need to take action against those that are supposed to represent the them.
