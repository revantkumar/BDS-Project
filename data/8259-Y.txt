I strongly SUPPORT this OPT expanding.
1. The United States is a friendly country with largest number of international students. This expanding will give a significant good impression to the world.
2. Having international students working here for longer time is good for our development. We need the diversity of culture and knowledge.
3. Everyone should be equal in the country. F-1 students don't have immigrant desire and won't occupy any resource of ours. They just need an opportunity to improve themselves and we should provide that.
