I do support this OPT-extention. Over the years, foreign tech workers contributed tramendous growth to the USA economy. Without policies like OPT-extension USA will probably lose this force and will lose a large portion of growth that the foreign workers bring about. If that happens, it would just be a matter of time before USA becomes another mundane country where American Dream no longer comes true. Without the embraciveness of foreign workers, I can forsee someday very soon when USA economy stagnates, people lose jobs, and social problems arises. DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN. APPROVE the OPT-extension.
