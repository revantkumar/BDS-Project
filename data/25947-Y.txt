I strongly support the decision. I don't know why there are so many American people unhappy about it. I'm native student getting my master degree, and there are a lot of international students in our program. 

I think they really work hard, like much harder than most of American students, and they have better background in technical fields like computer programming and quantitative analysis. If companies are hiring technicians, like engineers, they should hire people with stronger skills.
