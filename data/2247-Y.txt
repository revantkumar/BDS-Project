I strongly agree with this proposal as this is mutually beneficial for US high tech employers and stem international students.

The extended length of OPT extension can help stem international students learn more about practical working experience and thus benefit their employers, who are in great demand for employees with mastery stem related knowledge they learned from accredited US universities.

As a manager in a IT company, we are working in a fast growing and continuously changing environment. I am always complaining to our HR about shortage of engineers as I have to hire some international graduates who hold a computer science degree to finish all our tasks before deadline. If we only hire US citizens with stem degree, that will make us short-handed because you can find few of such persons in the job market, considering the high work load of IT team like us.

In my team, I have to offer benefit package which is much better than market average to in order to hire those candidates no matter whether he or she is a US citizen or not because a lot of other employers are actively seeking for stem degree engineers as well. If we don't do this and cannot hire enough qualified employees, then we will be less competitive in the industry.

With these reasons, I strongly agree with lengthening opt extension as my employees can work for us longer than before, and we will have less turn over rate which is benefit my team and our company to be more competitive in the market.
