As a citizen and employer, I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. What's kind of international student can be working at U.S? They must be a talent and outstanding person. So why do not let them stay at our companies. Honestly, I was an international student and came from Japan. As I know, nobody was hurt because I has been working at here. I hired some international students, they make me impressed. They work hard and require less. I doubt some people try to attack this policy, they are trying to hinder our country's development.

2. Actually, this policy will not let our citizens to lose jobs, it will be improve these people to find more opportunity. Why I say that? Most of international students are great employee and they can make more values for our companies. If our companies earn more money, we can hire more people. Naturally, we can hire more citizens.

When I was heard my employee discussed this stuff and there are some people refuse this policy, I was shocked. How they are so short-sighted. I think it is a win-win for both our country and international students working with OPT to approve the 24 months extension.
