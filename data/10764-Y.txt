I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I think that 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program. Based on my previous work experience at Dun&Bradstreet, most large research development projects would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion.
