John Wu I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S. Because this is not only very important for US economic, international students create a lot of jobs for local people and they also fill the need of talents for high tech industry.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S society and industries, if we look into history of US, international students make a great contribution to US in scientific research, technological progress and industrialization. A lot of Nobel prize winner was international students before.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Competition makes sure that the industry get better employees and keep this country grows health and remain strong, powerful. And the STEM students will not have a impact on majority of American citizens, their main career is in high tech industry, which have a growing shortage on young , competitive talents.

4.US is and will always be an equal, free country, this freedom and fair spirit is inherited from legacy of founding fathers. Everyone who wants to contribute to this great and beautiful nation should have right to stay.
