I strongly agree with the proposal to extend the OPT for STEM international students! Firstly, the U.S. academic sector benefits from this proposal since it can attract much more international students to choose U.S. universities and colleges, as far as I know, without an extension, many elites are considering going to Europe and Asian to continue study and those countries are actively attracting international students by various means. Besides, taking my major---civil engineering---as an example, short OPT period restraints our deeper participation into big construction projects in civil engineering, since we all know, it usually takes more than two or three year to finish a huge project. So as a student who really wish to get herself involve into these big and challenging project, I urge that the duration of OPT could be extended into a long period.
