I strongly support this act for the following reasons:
1.Everyone has equal oppotunity. It is good for US education effects.The people who really makes continue efforts will never be subsititude.
No matter what color of your skin, your nationality, even if who is your father(:D), talented students or deligilent person will always gain the initiative.
Just in my view, It is admitted that natives have advantages over the competition. So why do they think the employers choose foreigners is a threaten for Americans entry into the workforce ? Should these people consider more about the factors of themselves rather than be angry of the international students?

2. It's good for US economy to have talented foreign people work in STEM area.

3. It's good for US innovation of education and technology. Longer OPT will attract more talented students study in US and infuse much more ideas and achievements.
