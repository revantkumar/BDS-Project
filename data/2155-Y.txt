OPT extension must be extended and it should be fully SUPPORTED. International students only take a few years to do the training during their graduate school time. Most of them are very hardworking and productive in STEM field since it is not easy for them to study abroad, most of them also pay a lot to US universities for studying (This is a huge part of university income, if OPT cannot be extended, less student will come to US for study for sure, they can choose a better one---Europe). It is highly efficient and economic for government to train those students gaining their skills. To US society itself, those students will definitely contribute to the development of technology in so many professional fields. Besides, diversity is necessary for the United States, or people won't learn from each others.
Many comments said foreigners will 'rob' their jobs. Such an high competitive environment definitely is required for a powerful nation. Without competition, the progress of technology environment will absolutely decrease, which is definitely not what we are eager to see.
