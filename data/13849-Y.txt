I believe UK, Canada, Australia, Europe as well as Hongkong, Singapore are competing with United States for international students. Each international student without scholarship spends over 80,000 US dollars per year on average. What are they looking for? Better education, better environment, better placement. These three factors are indispensable. I'm applying for graduate programs in America right now and I can easily find big STEM word on the page: universities persuade international students that a STEM program is the strongest advantage.

Think of STEM again please: Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. These four pillars support and urge the country to move forward. China, India, Russia, and even North Korea spend large amount of government revenue on the four pillars as well, so we saw the nuclear weapon from North Korea. Admittedly, America is still in the lead, but in imminent danger. Most people want to work for their home country, if America is not attractive enough. Australia holds for immigrants of accountant, nurse, cook and mechanic because it lacks. Then does America really have a galaxy of talents already that we could drive the tech-talents away?

A strong country has the power to control the immigrants who only want to enjoy the welfare but never make a contribution to the country. However, students from STEM programs are the ones who can add the most value to America. After all, an OPT extending to 29 months doesn't guarantee anything including a job. Students still have to hunt for jobs themselves, and those who finally get the H-1B certainly have the ability to contribute to America. OPT is only an opportunity given to those people who are well-prepared and never an insurance to incompetent and lazy immigrants.
