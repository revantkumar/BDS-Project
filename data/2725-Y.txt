Please allow opt extension! We international student came to America not for stealing jobs from local people but for experience and learning from the U.S. If we have no ability to work here, no one would hire us and the OPT extension won't be local people's problem anyways. Howevet, if we do have the skills that companies need, it would be a waste that we have to leave after one year when our OPT end. Therefore, please extend the OPT for STEM program and thank you so much for understanding.
