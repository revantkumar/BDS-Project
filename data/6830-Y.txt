As an American citizen and taxpayer, I want this stopped immediately. This is a mockery of our system for the American. Please consider our already stressed job market and allow our own children the opportunity to utilize these jobs for their future!!! My grandchildren will be part of the next generation that will suffer because of immigration markets.
