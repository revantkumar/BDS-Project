I oppose any expansion of assistance programs to foreign students.
Too many of our native born remain unemployed despite 40+ government training programs. Nobody seems to care about cost to taxpayers anymore. If Microsoft wants to layoff workers to hire foreigners, let them train them.
That won't work because then the foreigners will demand MORE.
This is all creating a new class of idle poor who will also be supported by taxpayers, who numbers continue to diminish.
