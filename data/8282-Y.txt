The argument that companies tend to foreign workers with discounted pay does not stand its point. According to http://www.usatoday.com/story/mo ... nies-115k/31303639/, at least for tech industry, big companies offer relatively competitive salary along with their growth. For the big companies that are also big heads in applications for H1 visas each year, they pay foriegn employers just as much as citizen workers. The employers know the right wage for right skills. Necessity comes before money. No excuses for not capable of landing a job.
