I would like the extension of OPT to take effect as soon as possible. Since it is a way to show that the United States is still willing to cultivate the next generation with practical skills rather than to only generate income from foreign students. 

Education is a big investment to our future in many ways, and financially independent is part of that. We all want to make the right investment. Usually it takes more than two years to let the new graduates be familiar with the industry. OPT gives them the time to assure they can work professionally and independently. How disappointed would the students feel when they just don't have enough time to practice their skills? That little time would not make them competitive enough to handle their own life, especially with that huge tuition burden. They could even be mislead that what they have learned was useless, not even worth the tuition.
