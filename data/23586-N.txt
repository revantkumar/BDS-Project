The Department of Homeland Security needs to protect America and Americans. If changes in visa regulations are made they should be to create greater accountability and Tighten up regulations to make sure that aliens do not take places from Americans either in the classroom or Jobs. Those that are allowed to come to America need to be monitored closely and need to be out of the country within a week of completing school. Any aliens that are hired should be hired on a tap out basis by American job seekers. If an American wants a aliens job then the alien has to leave the country. When I was in the Sugar Industry we hired West Indian workers on visas. We had to pay them close to 3 times the minimum wage required to hire an American why should high tech companies be able to hire aliens for less than an American? That is wrong, wrong, wrong.
