I support this movement to make brilliant entrepreneurs who have received the best education in the United States, be given their legitimate place as citizens, in this amazing country. These H1 visa holders have been in queue for their green cards for a decade and more. They have set their companies 5 years and more, ago, employ a large number of American and non American citizens in their business set ups and thus contribute hugely to the US economy.
