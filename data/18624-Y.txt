As an international student in US, I strongly agree with the 24-month extension for STEM OPT for several reasons. First of all, with the extended time, we will be able to work in US with more flexible length of time and better prepare ourselves for potential jobs in our home country after we finish OPT. In a lot of cases, the projects that OPT holders that work with require long time such as 3 years or more. Secondly, I think employers will also be benefited since they want to hire people that can potentially work with them for long time since hiring new people and getting new people trained cost a lot of resources and time. Last but not least, I am sure educational institutions will be more active in recruiting international students and that's very good for international cultural and economic growth in US as well.
