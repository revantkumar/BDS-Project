Gene Nelson, Ph.D. This is the first paragraph of Chapter 10, "OPT: Open-Borders Bureaucrats Run Amok" of the November, 2015 book by Michelle Malkin and John M. Miano, J.D. titled, Sold Out - How High-Tech Billionaires and Bipartisan Beltway Crapweasels are Screwing America's Best and Brightest Workers.

The Optional Practical Training program is entirely the creation of unelected bureaucrats. This de-facto guest worker program first came into existence under Republican president George H.W. Bush, expanded under his son George W. and ballooned again under Democratic President Barack Obama. Lawmakers in Washington had no say. The American people had no say. Congress had authorized a brief pilot program allowing work under foreign student visas as part of the 1990 Immigration Act. But lawmakers let it lapse amid concerns that it ran "counter..... to an affirmative policy of U.S. labor force development, "may have adverse consequences for some U.S. workers," and was "inconsistent with the statutory intent of the F-1 nonimmigrant visa."

For the reasons set forth in the above paragraph, the OPT program should be immediately terminated. 

Additional details are found in the attached file, which consists of the Simon & Schuster publicity text for this book and a paragraph from the book's introduction.

Index listings regarding the OPT program are included in the attached file, which by extension should form an appendix to this entry. However, I do not possess the copyright of this important expose, so I am only including "fair use" excerpts from the book. 

As a harmed experienced American citizen technical professional, I was one of the original plaintiffs in the 2008 Programmer's Guild lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security after the George W Bush administration expanded OPT the program.
