I strongly support the proposal, for these reasons:
1. In fact, there are much more international students than Americans enrolled in graduate school for STEM study. If OPT extension is cancelled, most likely the number of international students will decrease dramatically, which means much less income for our education system. Also remember, most international students have money. You can check the tuition for international and american students respectively. International students can not only pay more tuition, but also buy more cars, rent more apartments here, and much more!

2. Even if international students find job here, that could also be good for us in other ways. Non-citizens usually get less salary and pay the same amount of tax! We need more tax instead of borrowing money from other countries.

3. We spend a lot of money building world class universities, hiring world class faculties. Then these STEM students receive the best education here and go back to make contribution to home countries, which are most likely our competitors (e.g. India and China). Is that what we want? No!
