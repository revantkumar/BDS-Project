I fully support this rule. 

There is still a large demand of jobs for STEM students, and companies are spending a lot of resources and effort in hiring great STEM employees. However, since there is a high chance of not getting H1b visa due to the lottery policy within the duration of OPT at the moment, many of the new hires who are not able to get valid work permission in time have to be either relocated to other countries if their companies support, or simply to be laid off. This unfortunately results in (1) huge waste of energy and resources in the hiring and training for the new employees, (2) increased cost in relocating the employees, and (3) inefficiency in communication and collaboration for cross-country projects. 

In addition, given the concern about getting the working permit in a very short time, STEM candidates are more likely to prefer companies with foreign branches so that they can be relocated out of US when they don't get H1b in time. This makes the small businesses and startups less competitive in hiring great people, and thus less likely to survive. This creates an hazardous effect to the health of the economic growth.
