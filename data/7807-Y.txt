Ruofan Yan I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL, because it can keep our American dream alive.

I am an international student who graduated about 2 years ago and now working in a big tech company. Unfortunately, I didn't win the H1B lottery of this year. OPT STEM extension is the only way to keep me employed with a legal status. Tens of thousands of people are facing the same issue. They work in different areas, and they are all contributing to America. Our English is not better than native people, but we still got employed. This is NOT because we are paid less, this is because we worked really hard. Harder than most of you could imagine. Hard work should pay off.

America is famous for it's fairness and diversity. This attracts hundreds of thousands of international students to study in America. If this proposal can't get approved, it's doubtful whether these student will still choose America as their first choice because other countries can provide them a more friendly policy helping them find a job. America will face a great loss of talented international students and tuition income.

Based on what I know, America still need more eligible STEM students.(http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/09/15/the-stem-worker-shortage-is-real). Making this new rule approved can effectively solve this problem. We are not taking the job opportunities of native people, we are trying to fill the jobs which employers can't find a good native candidate. 

This new OPT STEM extension is a triple win for international students, American people and American employers. It can help international students get enough working experience by extending the length of OPT Extension. Longer OPT STEM extension can attract more international students to study in America, which can provide more jobs to unemployed people. For American employers, this new rule can help them hiring more high-quality STEM students, which is what they need. THIS PROPOSAL SHOULD definitely GET APPROVED.
