SHUQIAN ZHAO I am writing to support the new STEM OPT extension rule. 

1) International students don't take the jobs from US citizens. 80% of the jobs in America only hire US citizens. For the remaining 20% of jobs, international students compete with America students with the disadvantages of their languages and their cultural differences. Only super talented international students can get the jobs because of their outstanding professional skills. Why US want to send these treasure to other countries?

2) More international students will come to US if we extend the STEM OPT, which will boost US economy. A lot of students choose US rather than Australia, England, Germany for their further study is not only because of the high-quality education but also because of the OPT. With OPT, they can gain practical industry experience, which is important for new graduates. The new opt extension rule will attract more this kind of students to US, which will boost US domestic consumption (restaurants, house leasing, and so on).

3) Tech companies will experience hard time if STEM opt extension is canceled. Tech companies have a lot of employee working with the STEM OPT extension right now. If this is canceled, these employee will be forced to go back to their home countries and companies will have a lot of highly professional jobs nobody can do. Especially for startups, they may even cannot maintain their business. 

Please please please launch this rule!
