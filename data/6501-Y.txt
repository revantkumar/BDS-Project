Tongkai Lu This OPT extrnsion is important to the U.S. economy because it helps keep foreign workers, who mostly work very hard in order to keep their job. Think about this: why would any employer spend more money on hiring foreign workers if they are not creating more values than the local guys? So It's not just for the benefit of those foreign workers themselves but also for the whole U.S. economy that we should extend the OPT for F-1 status students.
