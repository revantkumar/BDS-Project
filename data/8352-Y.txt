Jacken Lu I strongly support the OPT extension policy. It offers opportunities for those study in U.S. for 3 or 5 years or even more. This policy will no doubt relief the pressure of requirement of high quality intelligence in specific area. At the same time I will also stimulate the economy to increase more jobs for US. citizens.
