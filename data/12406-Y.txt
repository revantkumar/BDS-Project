I applaud the current interest in foreigners entering the US and taking American Citizen's jobs.

I am currently 67 years old and have been forced to turn to Social Security in order to keep living in this country. I AM A US CITIZEN!

I'm in the IT industry and have been subjected to both AGE AND NATIONALITY discrimination... Mostly from the larger corporations like Google and Cisco. While there I frequently responded to emails and was constantly updating my spell checker data base because the recipient's names were not of this country.

I would like to see a requirement to audit AND report findings on just how many foreign workers ARE in a company. My feeling is that these corporations are taking advantage of the various visa programs and replacing US Citizens with Foreign Nationals who are either in the US on a temporary basis or given a fast track to citizenship. Other corporations are outsourcing their work TO CORPORATIONS BASED in other countries who employ people from that country. WiPro is one such company but there are others. These workers are mostly from India and China.

Our political processes are DANGEROUSLY vulnerable to outside FINANCIAL influences... including our very own Law Makers (i.e., politicians). This needs to be stopped!

Thanks,

George...
