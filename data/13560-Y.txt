I STRONGLY SUPPORT this proposal!
First, I think opportunity is equal to everyone. Equality is one of the reasons that attract me to this country. If we can't working here just for our nations or races, it will break my heart. What's more,I'm a student in CS. So that's why I choose this country for my master degree. it's the best in the world! If this proposal passes, I can have a deeper understanding of the applications about what I have learnt in university.
What's more, I don't think we are trying to "compete" with American citizens. In my class, there are few Americans, most of them are from india, China or Hong Kong. And for those Americans, they already have a job and they want a better profermence in their job, so they back to school again. I think our international students give American citizens a chance to consider what they need for their career.
