I strongly support the OPT Extension program. As a foreign student studying computer science, the opportunity to work in hi-tech companies is a major reason when I choose studying in the States. Working experience is a important part in computer science education. With OPT program, not only can I contribute my wisdom to hi-tech companies, but also I can learn valuable experience from the employer. It is a win-win program. I do support it.
