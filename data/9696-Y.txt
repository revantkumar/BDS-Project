The STEM opt provides thousands of high intelligent workers for America IT companies and attracts thousands of young students come to study in American universities. I think the government and American people should look further, don't just focus on arguing one or two jobs. These high intelligent alien workers bring the technology and research up, create many more job opportunities for American people too. If these people are forced to leave America with their advanced degree, they can easily get a job in other western countries or go back to their home countries, make them stronger, make them more competitive than US companies. Then Americans will really lose their job opportunities and many more at that time. 

Honestly speaking, I am an international student. You may think I speak for myself. However, I really believe that STEM OPT is good for the US. I lived in US for more than 7 years and got two degrees, here is my second home. I love USA and American people. If US government paid more than 200000 USD for me to get my graduate degree and then send me back home, that is not a wise choice. Because what we want is just working for some of the world's best companies and bring happiness to our families, the US, and the American people.
