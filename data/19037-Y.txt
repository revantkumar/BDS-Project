I strongly support the extension of OPT by 24 months. From my own experience, international students contribute a lot to US economy by working hard in all kinds of areas. Further extension of opt will create more opportunities for international students, which will enhance the diversity in US and collect more smart people from all over the world. This will help to technique development and financial increase, which will benefit US citizens as well.
