I strongly SUPPORT this proposal for the following reasons:

1. I am now a master in Applied Statistics student. After graduation, I need time to get work experience to improve my competitiveness before I come back to China. The OPT extension in one of the reason for me to study in the US, otherwise, I think I will choose to go to Europe such as England, Germany or Australia since they have much lower tuition fee.

2. Diversity is very important reason for the US to be prosperous in the recent years. Many of the leaders in big technology company are not native. For example, the CEO of Microsoft, Satya Narayana Nadella, and the CEO of Goole, Sundar Pichaiis are from India. It is because that the US can attract so many talented people from the world, it can remain in the top position in the world.

3. If an American student and a foreign student competes for the same position, then the company will choose the American student if their ability are similar. The companies tend not to recruit foreign students since they need to help them to apply for H1B. So that some people's worry about foreign students stealing your job are totally not necessary. If you study hard and work hard, with your language advantage, you can get your dream job for sure.
