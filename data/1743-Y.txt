I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. A large number of students study hard in universities and excel in their field. They have done significant and unignorable contribution to the universitnies. I don't see any problem if government supports them continuous making contribution to the country. Extension of OPT could significantly help them to development themselves and this make better contribution. 
2. Since there are many students with competitive skill sets, the county should keep thirst students not only for diversity, but also for keeping the talent for the country. As other countries are making policies to attract the talent to their own countries for future development, US should the same in stead of blocking them away from america. OPT can be a good policy not only to attract those students to stay in U.S, but also the select the really experts from the group. 
3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Many international students did not grab jobs from US citizens. The ones who said so are the American citizens who can not find a suitable job. Hardly can I believe the international students will grab elementary jobs from US citizens. Competition can help the United States better selection of talent, improve the average level for all, regardless of international students and domestic students can better enhance US global competitiveness. . .
