Scott Brown I am definitely support this proposal.
The OPT extension can not harm local citizens in job hunting. Many high tech companies are in short of qualified works, therefor the international students can fill the large hole. I believe the companies are fair in hiring employees thus we can not blame the international students if local citizens can not find a job. If these qualified and well educated students go back home, they would create huge wealth, job opportunities with what they learnt in the USA, why not let them stay and make contributions to our nation?
