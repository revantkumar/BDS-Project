I strongly support the implementation of this proposal to extend the opt to 24 months. I am a computer science engineer working in boston area for over 20 years. I have been working with hundreds of peer engineers from many different countries and let me tell you why I think it is important to have this rule passed. 1. international students with STEM are unlike the other international students and they are usually the best talents from their countries. To keep them working for the US is significantly important to maintain our lead in technical and scientific areas and to compete against the emerging power like China. We would not want to see these future field-leaders go back with the technology and experience gained here to benefit their own countries. Never! This will absolutely dampen our economy and global competence in the long run. 2. the major objection seems to stem from the fear that the international students will take American's jobs. This is really absurd. Can you show me any evidence that international students is taking jobs from US students in the STEM field? OPT is meant to fill out the deficit in the need for STEM talents. We are so desperate looking for qualified people and the supply from US students is far from enough. 3.Even competition does occur sometimes, as far as I know the company will always prefer domestic candidates over international students if they are equally qualified. 4. can anyone tell me who havent been children or grandchildren of immigrants, like those from Europe? We ourselves are offspring of immigrants and why we now have such big issues of being a little big generous to other immigrants, especially those international students who are truly talents and would benefit our country? I strongly believe people who oppose this proposal and who attribute the loss of their jobs to international students should drop their selfishness and make self-check regarding whats actually going wrong with themselves!!
