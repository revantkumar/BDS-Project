Venkata Sai Krishna Siripurapu I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the STEM OPT Extension rule.

I strongly support the extension rule.
As an International student, I know that most companies aren't willing to sponsor in spite of students having impressive qualifications. It is only during this OPT period where students actually have real chances of employment. More people come to the United States for education rather than to other countries because it is believed that the opportunities for employment here are more than anywhere else. In case, the OPT extension is not valid I do not think there would be many coming for higher education which definitely would impact the revenue.

US employment being affected because of OPT extensions doesn't make sense. There are not many US students who willing to go for higher degrees (Masters and Ph.D.). There is a shortage of workforce in the technical/engineering areas which are the areas most international students focus on thereby negating the point that it is the cheaper rates that companies employ foreign workers. If the students are on equal terms why would companies want to have an additional burden of sponsoring foreign workers when they can have someone without the need for sponsorship. Would having limitations set on foreign students improve the opportunities for US workforce? I do not think so moreover there might be an issue of lack of resources in such a scenario which would have companies to outsource which again doesn't involve US workforce.

As an International student myself, I came over to the US not just to do a master's degree but also with an intention to have experienced working in one of the most dynamic markets across the globe and the OPT extension is the tool that would fulfill the intention and I am sure that most share the same. The sudden amendments in the rule would affect the life of thousands of international students which is unfair because they come here with a dream of making a life.
