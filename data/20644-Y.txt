I definitely do support the proposal and I believe that the OPT-extension will for sure benefit the nation.

Firstly, it is apparent to see foreign technology workers' huge contributions to the growth of the USA economy. Without the extension, the US will lose a huge portion of growth for brain drain. 

Moreover, the US is well-known for its willingness to embrace people from different cultures and backgrounds which also facilitates its growth and development. However, without the extension, diversity will be impaired and creativity and innovation will be damaged which can be brought by foreign workers who often have different perspectives from the native ones.

Foreign workers will to some extent bring competition, but they will also bring more vitality and creativity. Competition is not a bad thing, it can encourage all of us to learn more and progress. A country without competition is hard to imagine. And for companies, they need more talented employees to better operate and to improve the living standards of people in US.

Therefore, the proposal is obviously excellent and necessary, for the benefit of the whole country and its people.
