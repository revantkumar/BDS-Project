I Strongly agree. 
The reason is pretty simple and straight forward.
According to reports available through NAFSA (Association of International Educations) it has been estimated that international students and their families have contributed $26.8 BILLION to the US economy and created or supported 340,000 jobs during the 2013-2014 Academic Year.
What 26.8 BILLION per year means? 
It's means 26.8BILLION=134000 ASRAAM Missiles per year. 
Why not?
