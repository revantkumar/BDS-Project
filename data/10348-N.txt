The US clearly does not need H1B Visa STEM workers! Corporations like Disney do not want to pay a first world wage when they can hire third world STEM workers through InfoSys for 2/3 the salary that they pay to US workers. This is madness and it must stop! There are plenty of unemployed STEM workers that are current US citizens.
