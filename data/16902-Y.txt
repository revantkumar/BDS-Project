I believe this policy is beneficial in many aspects.
1. Almost all of the international graduates who may receive the STEM extension will be looking for entry-level jobs as they are new-college-grads. Hence, this policy won't affect American experienced workers.
2. Moreover, there are a lot of international students in STEM majors. In many credit universities there are even more international students than American students. If there won't be any extension, then it's much harder for international students to find/keep a job in the U.S. This is extremely harmful to American STEM companies as they won't be able to keep hiring new entry-level employees as needed. And in the long term, obviously, this will cause short of workforce in STEM related areas.
3. This extension helps the U.S. to keep excellent international talents and allowing domestic companies keep accepting new blood to support their growth.
