I support the extension of OPT.

The extension policy can ensure those talented STEM students graduated from US universities have chances to contribute to our community. Our universities put so much resources on those students not just for their tuition, but also for their talents which help create a better future for our country. If we do not create opportunity for those students to stay here, not only it is a waste of our university resources, but also our country will keep losing talents which will make our country unattractive to high-level talents.
