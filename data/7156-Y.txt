I am going to US for graduate study in engineering next spring, and i think the extension of opt is a GREAT opportunity for me to obtain working experience after graduation. Engineering students are highly demanded by all US high tech companies like Google, Microsoft and etc. The extension of OPT all provide enough work labor to these companies. i got offers from US universities as well as high-ranked universities in Europe, and the longer OPT is one of the most important factors when comparing these universities. If the extension can not get passed, i am not sure i want to go to US for engineering study instead of German or Japan or even China.
