(1) I saw a lot of posters talking about the foreign students ruining the American middle class's jobs and lives, which is ridiculous. The employers always prefer their workers with better skills,status, cultural relationship and less payment. Based on that, the international students who want to earn the job must be more qualified for the job than the Americans.Specifically, we get the job based on my outstanding knowledge rather than steal American's job.Because, if i was an employer in American i would prefer to hire the Americans if they are qualified for the job compared to the foreigners.
(2) From the report, the American governments can't afford the social wage for the homeless and unemployment workers in the future, which caused lower income from the tax of salary and lower social productivity. American requires the everyone to work hard to maintain the healthy running of this big country machine, meanwhile, the good-skilled workers are the ones triggering them to be the hard-working one instead of staying at the home and getting the free money from the government.
(3) Foreign students come here to learn knowledge and go back to their country to be the competitive employees. One-year experience is not enough for them to be trained. In order to get the experience, a lot of international students get lower payment than native speakers, which should blame the employers to steal the job from American instead of us.
