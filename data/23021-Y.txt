Expanding training time to 24 months could encourage more entrepreneurship acts among F-1 Nonimmigrant students. This can potentially nourish more great companies and more job opportunities for local Americans. Why? First of all, F-1 STEM student has been greatly trained/invested by U.S top universities with their precious educational assets. They usually also have support from their families.(Their families usually have business resources across the globe so that they can afford the high tuition fee). Meanwhile, they are willing to take a lot of more risks by studying in a foreign country. (That's the spirit of immigration!) So F-1 STEM students are prepared educationally, psychologically and financially to become entrepreneurs. With the extension of 24 months, the total minimum stay of any F-1 STEM students will become 36 months. That is 3 years! It will be just enough for someone to think about starting their own company. This 3 year period will allow one to fail and try again for their business pursuit. This psychological effect can encourage more students to think of the option of founding their own company. Otherwise, F-1 STEM students tend to get a job right after their graduation to secure their stay in U.S. Last but not least, F-1 STEM founders will be more willing to hire their U.S companions not only because they want to embrace the U.S market but also because if they hire enough Americans in certain regions, they can file immigration petition for themselves. So in conclusion, expanding the training time is beneficial to U.S people, to local economy and to F-1 STEM students.
