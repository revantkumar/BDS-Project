I believe that immigrants need to be given the time and benefit of the superior technology in America to help build the foundation for a culturally diverse, fundamentally strong economy that will help everyone live better lives. Opt give people enough time to locate themselves, learning new skills, it is a contribution to the people and will attract more people to create in the US.
