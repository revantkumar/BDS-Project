I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The prosperity of US is based on the top talents from the whole world. Without OPT extension, those who can make significant contributions to a specific company, STEM area or even the whole America may return to their own country, and then in few years later we may not so competitive with other countries.
2. Most people who pursue master degree, PHD, and postdoc. on STEM are foreign students, so there is less job competition between native and foreigners.
3. Because of so many restrictions and clearance requirements, it is not so easy for foreigners to find a job here. For example, my boyfriend is a PHD who studies sensor. It took him almost one year to find a job. I do not think any native college students need to spend one year on job hunting.
4. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S
