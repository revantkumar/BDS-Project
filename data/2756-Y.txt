Robert Hahn Sirs: How about accommodating our CITIZENS ? Not illegals ! Illegals, by definition, have NO benefits, NO say, so NO accommodations. Become U.S. citizens, THEN you have a valid leg to stand-on. PERIOD ! 
U.S. citizens MUST be afforded any training and assistance for job opportunities. ONLY after ALL U.S. citizens who request job placement/opportunities...THEN, consider opportunities for "others", BUT, ONLY for those who have LEGALLY applied for U.S. citizenship ! PERIOD !
