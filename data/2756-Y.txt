I strongly SUPPORT the proposal of OPT extension. As an incoming international student, the OPT extension policy is really the reason why I ended up choosing to pursue BS in CS in the univerisity in the USA. The OPT extension (12 + 24 months) is helpful in many different ways:

1. I want to go back China when I graduate, this is absolutely no doubt. However, in order to gain a competitive advantage, I want to work for a big corporate in the USA for a couple of years first, especially those companies who want to pursue a revenue avenue in China (Facebook, Uber, etc). By doing so I can combine my advantages: being a Chinese and having 2-3 yrs working experience in the headquarter in the United States.

2. The STEM extension can help significantly with me finding a internship as well. I have a cousion who is studying the US and according to him that the OPT extension has helped him significantly landing internships. He claimed that most employers hire interns as a candicate for their full-tim employee. So knowing that we have the 12+24 month extension, they are way much more likely to provide us internship opportunities (so we can easily transition to a full-time employee after performaning well during the internship.)

All in all, I strongly believe OPT extension will not only help significantly both the international students and local businesses.
