I highly support this rule for the following reasons;
1It is well known that foreign students ,studied in united states can promote the local economy. Also, it would look good on their employment rates to some extent.
2Those foreign students who can find their jobs after graduation must be a talent persons, and they indeed an indispensible part of their company, also for the America. Which is the local government should weight the advantage and the disadvantages.
3They most important reason why so many foreign students chose America, I think, is that people yearn for freedom and openness. If the rule goes smoothly, more and more talented students will be attracted to study in united state.
