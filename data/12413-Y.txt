Dear Ladies and Gentleman,

F-1 STEM students are very valuable for our workforce. They bring fresh wind in this country and contribute with culture diversity and new ideas.

All the students I know have an excellent education. Having said that they challenge their peer and herewith raise the quality of work in US companies.

They should have the right to work, live and prosper here, because they are improving to the quality of our work and are important for cultural interactions in the workplace. New and different ideas from different people will enable us to accomplish excellent results.
