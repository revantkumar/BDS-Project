As an international student, the reason to come to the US is of course for the education and resources here. This great personal experience helps individual move forward in their career and provides a great opportunity to pursue the goals in their lives.

I also do believe this country, Unites States Benefits a lot from this process. The current 1 year opt is practically short for personal training and experiencing, and most of the times, it discourages people to work in the US. If we are in a mutual benefit situation, why not make it better? 

Longer training time period can provide more opportunities for improving the work force, creativity and value of the individuals and country.
