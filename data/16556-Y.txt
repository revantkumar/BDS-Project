I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons:
1, Extension on the OPT gives better chance for talented international students to find jobs in US.
2, One job taken by international students create more jobs for US citizens, and activate the US economy.
3, If these talented students are not employed in US, they will go back to their home land and apply what they learned to the competitors of the US and the US companies. This is a win and lose game, if the competitors become better while US and US companies become weaker because of these talented international students who are well trained in the US reverse the direction of flowing for job, US citizens will regret their short-sighted policies in the future for sure. This is very similar to ancient China, when there were 7 kingdoms and each of the 7 kings tried their best to attract talented people to work for them, and those who were the best at this made their countries stronger and the best of the best was Qin Kingdom, of which almost all famous and talented governors and generals come from the other 6 kingdoms, and the King finally conquered them all and united the ancient China after 5 generations. On the contrary, those kingdoms that created many talented people but was not able to make the best use of them lost terribly. It's not the country that create the largest number of the most talented people who will win at last, but the country that can attract those people and make the best of their skills and talents that is invincible.

In sum, in order to maintain the current status of US as the world leading figure in Technology, Science and many other areas and to keep the American Sprite up as the example for freedom and equal chance, and for the better life of all US citizens, all people, especially the US citizens should support this proposal without any doubt.
