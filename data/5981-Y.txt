Hello all,
First of all, let me say that I am 100% opposed to this proposed piece of law in regards to the F-1 Student visas. There is no way, that foreign students should be allowed to stay longer in the USA, and then compete against American citizens who have invested a huge amount of time/effort and also money into getting a college degree. It is unfair for the Americans, because of course businesses would love to hire someone who they don't have to pay regular entry level wages and the other FICA, Social Security taxes, it's money in their pockets, and it hurts Americans and the programs set up to help Americans. I have no problem with these young people coming to the USA to get their education, it speaks very well about the quality of higher education here versus say in China, where so many of the students come from now. But let them abide by the agreement on their F-1 student visa and go back to their home countries. America needs its young people to be gainfully employed, so as to better their lives, and the lives of their families.
