I STRONGLY support the proposal to expand training opportunities for STEM F-1 international students. Big tech companies aren't silly. They always hire the best talents they can have. If anyone thinks international students 'steal' opportunities from American students, WAKE UP. 

THE PROBLEM IS NOT INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS, BUT OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM!!! American educational system (especially pre-college preparation) is not able to produce sufficient supply of competitive STEM Americans to the job market. That's the reason why American tech companies want to hire international talents.

If we want to solve this problem and see more Americans hired by tech companies, PUSH FOR AN EDUCATIONAL REFORM! ADD MORE STEM REQUIREMENTS STARTING FROM HIGH SCHOOL!!!MAKING TECH COMPANIES LIMIT INTERNATIONAL TALENTS IS EQUAL TO STOPPING THOSE COMPANIES FROM GROWING AND MAKING INNOVATIONS!!! 

And tech companies powered by international smart minds are the leading power of our economy nowadays. DON'T MAKE AMERICA LOSE ITS POWER AND CREATIVITY!!
