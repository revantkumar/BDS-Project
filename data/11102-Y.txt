I support the proposed rule. 

Regarding the argument that labor force from International Stem Students leads to high unemployment rate in the U.S, I would say it is ungrounded.

According to Statista, the occupations that have the highest unemployment rate are Farming, Fishing and Forestry occupations (11%), Construction and extraction occupations (7.1%) and Transportation occupations (6.7%). Stem students are not eligible for these occupations since they are not STEM related. On the contrary, professional related occupations (2.2%), Business, management and Financial Operations occupations(2.2%) have the lowest unemployment rate, way lower than average unemployment rate which is 5%.

Therefore, I truly believe that Foreign students are NOT taking aways jobs from U.S. Citizens
