Seema Narayan I support STEM extension proposal. The goal of the extension is NOT taking up jobs of Americans. Rather it aims to work towards supporting US economy as the country lacks resources in STEM fields. Moreover, it is extremely incorrect to say that international students are taking up jobs of Americans. If an American is more suitable for a STEM job, he would definitely get it if he clears the interview. That's the sole goal of conducting job interviews-selecting the most suitable candidate. In no way would an international student be given preference over a citizen.
