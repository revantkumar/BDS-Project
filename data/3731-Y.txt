I think opt is a crucial opportunity for any students studying STEM in US from other countries.
I really know and understand the concerns of some people who disagree with the proposal.
I hope to say that the objective of OPT is not robbing the US students of their job opportunities but create a better job market 
for the whole country. It has been seen that foreign students have made their own contributions to this country and pursue their dreams here. Moreover, many foreign entrepreneurs have created many job opportunities for US people.

Recalling the forefathers' spirit of this country, I think it is better to gather the smart people from all over the world rather than reject them and close the door.
