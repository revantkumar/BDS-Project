I am writing to ask that you abolish such programs as H1B and the optional practical training program for foreign workers.

We have record numbers of American workers out of the work force
We have record numbers of people in the stem fields that are being forced out of their jobs, only to be replaced with foreign workers.
We have a social security trust fund problem, only exacerbated by non payment into the system by foreign workers.
We have depressed wages, which hurts govt revenue.
Finally we have a govt. that places the interests of foreigners ahead of Americans.

We are in a place that we never should be. End these programs that hurt Americans.

Thank you
