I strongly support the approval of this OPT extension policy, because:

1) Foreign students are making contributions to the U.S., and these contributions should not be ignored.

2) America is famous for it's diversity and freedom. If America does not support Foreign students' working here for a certain period, is American still the one that people value and are proud of? Can America still be the strongest country in the world?

3) Globalization is the present and the future. Allowing foreign students to work here is great for the U.S. society to embrace and sieze the oppotunities in the globalization age.
