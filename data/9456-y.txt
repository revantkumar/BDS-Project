Mingming Zhang I am working on a cutting-edge filed called neural engineering, developing devices that could allow us to innervate with nervous system, so that we can treat and relive the neural disorder symptom. This field of study moving slowly because the complexity and challenge we are facing in human nervous system. Personally, extend OPT to 24 months, or even 36 months will prolong the research and development phase for the cutting-edge project I am working on. In fact, many people in my field are trained as a phd and a big part of them are international students. Keep the specialty and skills like this in U.S. is absolutely very useful and important for the medical field in this country. Also, neural engineering product could potentially benefit other filed, like military and entertainment industry. So I fully support that the STEM extension will be 24 months, or even 36 months.
