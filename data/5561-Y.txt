Teng Lu Dear sir or madam,

I'm fully support this Act. As a STEM and an international student, I know how hard they work in schools and all the companies to stay in this country. They come to this country to do all they can to sharpen their skills ,improve their communication skills and overcome cultural differences to fit into this country better and chase American dream. In the meanwhile, the development and prosperity of United States can not stay away with all the contributions from all those international students, especially in STEM area. 
As U.S. economy just walked out of the shadow of 2008 financial crisis and is embracing a new round of prosperity, it eagerly need the contributions from those STEM new graduates who just start their career. Passing the extending OPT Act would greatly increase the opportunity of STEM students staying in U.S. while veto of it would close their door. What's more, it would prevent further international students who want to study and work in U.S. from coming to this country and chasing their dream. 
Hope you can pass this Act to benefit all the STEM students who are studying and working in U.S., and the potential candidates who want to.

Sincerely thanks,
Teng
