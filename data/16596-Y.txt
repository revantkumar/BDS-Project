As a STEM student, I support this new rule. I think OPT/OPT Extension and the possible further H1B program is the most important way of US companies to retain the foreign talents educated in US institutions. 

First thing to note is the extension is only applicable to E-Verified firms and the program itself ensure that all the employment decision is not biased. 

So actually the extension program could be viewed as a filtering mechanism to retain those foreign talents that US companies think will be help to the firm because the extension program actually enables companies to take whoever they want to hire and possibly sponsor H1B for them while let go those who cannot meet the criteria they set. 

If only 12-month OPT is allowed, companies will no longer have the option to select the talents they want to retain and a lot of people with great talents who are willing to work for the US may not be able to do so because 12-month OPT will only allow one chance of H1B application and the result of this application is not discretionary but a result of luck and possibility. I think this is not what the US public would like to see. 

I could probably give some more examples, my friend, a PhD from a top notch university in his field of study, may not be able to work for US not because he is not deemed as someone who could help his firm but because he is unlucky. So will be the cases for a huge number of students educated from top undergraduate schools and graduate schools. The extension of OPT will help US companies to keep these talents to work for US and this is certainly a win-win for both STEM students and US economy.
