Immigrants with STEM degrees probably only make a very small portion of total immigration population into the U.S. Yet these people offer the U.S. and the world something that is unimaginable. 40% of Fortune 500 companies was founded by immigrants or their children. Google, Yahoo, Nordstrom, Pfizer, Dupont, just to name a few. Not granting the STEM immigrants the OPT extension would send those people back to their home countries, or some other countries that desperately need immigrants with outstanding math and engineering backgrounds. Just imagine what could happen in 10 years: direct competitions from the global slowly erodes away the leading edge of the U.S. on all fronts, and I am sure a large part is contributed by the STEM immigrants that were not able to stay in the U.S.

The U.S. is a great country. Its greatness doesn't come from the military muscles, or the politicians disagreeing each other just to please their own voters. It greatness comes from the nature of this country, which magnetizes the elites from the globe to come here to realize their dreams. This is a place where dreams come true. Regulators, please don't let that fake away.
