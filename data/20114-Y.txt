I fully support the government's and DHS' initiative to provide this extension to nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. Not only will this help STEM graduates and the companies in the STEM industry, it will also help other graduate students with no STEM degree by reducing the amount of nonimmigrants applying for work visas such as H1B.
