I think the OPT should be extended. F-1 students get knowledge here in America, and can also make contribution to American's development, many famous people make great impact in America and they were international students at first. And this rule will not affect American's job opportunities, because, there are many tech companies here in America, and they need great amount of employees, more than total numbers of F-1 students and American students. Besides, OPT is helpful to F-1 students and help them build their careers ,if force them leave America and back to their country, they will lose a lot of opportunities both in America and their motherland, it's also unfair.
