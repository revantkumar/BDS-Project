I strongly support this rule. It helps talented international students to apply what they learned in the university to American industries. US is famous for its liberty and equality. International students paid the same tuition as Americans do for their university study. They should get the same opportunity to look for jobs in US. And it is also very helpful for American Tech industries to absorb the most talented people all around the world, which is very beneficial for US development. As the number of H1B visa applications is increasing year by year, the OPT extension rule gives US companies a longer buffer time to keep talented students. If a company already hired a OPT student and it already invested time and money to train the student, it would be a big loss for the company if it has to give up this employee because of the OPT time limit.
