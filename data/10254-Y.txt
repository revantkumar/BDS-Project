Support the proposal. We need more foreign engineers to join us. Personally, these people don't grab the jobs from the citizens. The number of American engineers is far less than the number we need. Yes, we can cooperate with foreign companies, the engineers in China Indian are good. But this means we are dependent, this is dangerous, the foreign can hold our necks and kill us at any time they like. More friendly policies, more local companies and more jobs.
