International students studying in STEM have made very very significant contribution to the development in the technology and science industry in USA. They are all hard-working and nice people who can only benefit the country instead of bringing any harm. The extension of OPT will help not only the international students pursuing their dreams, but also help the US industry to keep leading the competition in the world. The extension is going to be an absolutely a win-win. I hope people can accept the proposal.
