Urvesh Patel My personal opinion is that all Indian and Chinese should come together and strongly support STEM extension as those are the one who will be greatly affected by STEM cancellation . Because most of these students come to US for studies with the purpose of obtaining a job in US. As the STEM cancellation will decrease the opportunity to work in US student will not come to pursue education in US.
