I strongly SUPPORT this proposal!

Someone may say that is the competition, but is not a bad thing. Competition can help us choose better talents, and promote the average level of all, both native students and international students. It can also improve the competitiveness of the United States in the world. Actually, these international students do not take low-wage to rob the citizen's jobs. They take the jobs that companies cannot find suitable persons among citizens for the positions.

On the other side, our government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities keep making contributions to the United States.
