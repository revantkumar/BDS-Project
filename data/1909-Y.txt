I strongly support the new proposed rule. 
Allowing students to be employed under OPT with the STEM extension is a fantastic benefit for the United States and its economy. 

1. It will attract more international student, who will bring a hug amount of revenue to US. At rate of $200000.00 per student for 2 year degree with tuition and graduation fees, staying expenses and other education revenue the US is receiving ( Total $80000000000.00) will go other countries with OPT system.

2. Based on my experience, these international students all look for jobs in the same way as any other American citizen does, they do the same interview process. Someone mentioned that it's cheaper to hire foreign workers, once again - not aware of the process, cost, risk to get a work authorization. The companies prefer hiring citizens because they don't have the risk to lost work authorization as the international students do.

3. Students will contribute to the growth of US Economy by paying the Taxes on their employment ( 3 Years x $3000 per year x 400000 students= Total $ 3600000000.00).
