I STRONGLY SUPPORT the idea of STEM extension is truly a good idea for the stable growth of large companies. It can give large companies recruit hardworking international engineering students for the positions which the number of domestic engineering students is not enough for.

I welcome this amendment to extend the OPT period for STEM graduates. Its great to see DHS taking this initiative that would help many American companies to have continued service from top class graduates from around the world. Recently I have seen many forums who spoke against foreign workers and asking for local jobs. They are not understanding the basic fact that for an American company to be the best in the world, they need the best talent in the world which eventually boosts the American economy itself.This amendment will have a long term impact on US Tech industry, with all these companies able to keep their competitive edge.

Its good for the students who have chosen US universities to get their Master degree, to achieve more exposure in US companies. US companies are known for having the most diverse resource pool which gives a unique opportunity for these students to work with top talents. With global universities competing to upgrade their status, these measures will provide a continued advantage to US Universities which have been a magnet for top students from all around the world.
