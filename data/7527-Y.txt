Jun Kang I strongly vote for the new policy of OPT extension. Many top students I know in our university have pursued for a master degree in the USA. Because they can not only study advanced knowledge in class,but also have work experience to become experts through the policy of OPT extension.If the policy is cancelled, I think many of them will consider to go to Britain or Germany to further study. As we all know, overseas students have contributed a lot to the development of the USA.They have many inventions and achievements in various areas. Without them, the development of the USA will not be so fast anymore. If the development is still,it is difficult for America to create more jobs to the local ordinary people. The unemployment rate will be worse.
