The OPT STEM Extension should be kept for the benefit of STEM graduate students and US companies. 
As an international student in the United States, I pursued a STEM degree and graduated in 2014 with master's science degree in the field of Mechanical Engineering. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States. I was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule. 
The STEM extension is very important not only for STEM international students, but also for their employers among different industries. Enrolled in graduate program in top US universities, the students have showed the outstanding performance in academy. In school, many of them also conduct internship in top US firms. Later, they become employed and start to contribute US economy in companies. Those employers know the excellent capacity of international students after rounds of interviews. There is no difference between international student and the other employees, but their working visa issues. OPT STEM Extension will help to relieve the problems caused by it, especially for those global companies with overseas business. So US companies could remain competitive around the world. Looking at the Silicon Valley, that is also one key parameter for US leading the world in technology innovation and revolution.
