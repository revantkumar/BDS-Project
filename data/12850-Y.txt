I strongly agree with this. Some people said they citizens pay taxes. Just remind that ALL employees in US pay taxes, and do contribution to US. All of them make American education, business, technology prosperous. International students bring diversity to US. Abolishing OPT extension cannot decrease the unemployment rate greatly because only people without skill cannot get employed. They do not have skill, and even though there are no international students, tech companies won't hire them. This will only decrease the prosperity of American economy, and maybe after a long time, US will fall behind other countries. OPT extension has been applied several years, and from the reality, it does bring prosperity to US.
