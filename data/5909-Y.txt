I strongly support this rule of OPT extension.

1. in American's spirit , people are born equally, so everybody who comes to the USA should have the fair chances to live and compete in this great land.
2.it has benefit to the development of the US society and economy, so many talented people are attracted to here, they are working hard to contribute the this country, there is no reason for the US not to accept these "elites". 
3. The STEM is crucial to the US society, and most people who are professional in STEM are foreigners, especially who studied in US universities before and got a degree here, they are irreplaceable and crucial to the whole US country and citizens.

some people may think that if the OPT extension are approved, there will be more foreign workers(in STEM) , which will let many American people lost there jobs. I totally disagree with this because:
1. the number of H1B every year given are limited, which means the opportunities for the foreign workers to have are limited. So there will be no circumstances in which the native American lost there jobs because of the OPT extension.
2. in most cases nowadays, many H1B offers are given to some ICC companies , which hire a lot of indian workers to the USA, and they are mainly people who are competing with the natives, so OPT students are not the major power of competing with the job market, and I think the department of immigration should consider this as the first-class assignment to handle.
