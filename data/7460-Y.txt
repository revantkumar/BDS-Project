Fiona Tsai I strongly support this new rule. I have a PhD in Applied Mathematics. This major is in desperate need of longer OPT. This new rule certainly does good to U.S. economy. On the other hand, even not a single student have opportunity to take 24-month OPT, this does not necessarily mean every U.S. graduate can find a decent job. You can not stop greedy people dreaming about their high pay no competitors job, and complaining about every chance they missed towards foreigners.
