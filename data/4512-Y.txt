This is a fantastic initiative and I strongly support the rule. I also believe that the STEM extension for F-1 students should be increased to 36 months instead of the proposed 24 months. This not only allows the companies to attract, train and retain some of the best and the brightest talent on earth but also yield huge benefits to the US economy overall.
