I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. It will help US to keep the No.1 position in science and high-tech. Those international students are usually the best students in their own country, we could earn a lot from them. Moreover, it will drive our own people to be energetic, working hard and make the society and high-tech moving faster and faster.
