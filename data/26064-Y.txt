Great news to hear. I am a landlord in Stony Brook. I am now an US citizen. My parents are from Taiwan. Lots of students come to Stony Brook to take the opportunity to get their bachelor or master's degree. I like those students. The reason is simple, they keep renting my house and I am very happy to see this. If u guys extend this rule, I will get more income from the students' side. For me, I support this for this reason.
