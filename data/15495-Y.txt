This is an extremely crucial proposal for the interest of international students. After paying massive amounts of tuition fees, international students are seeking to put what they've acquired in college into practice and make contributions to US corporations and institutions as well as achieving self-improvement. A successful legislation of this proposal could become a turning point of tens of thousands of international students' lives and mitigate their extraneous concerns on visa-related issues, setting them free from meaningless contraints and focus on work to grow with corporations and institutions.
