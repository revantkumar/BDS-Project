I support the decision of expanding the OPT extension to 24 months. F-1 students have always been a great population in supporting the science and technology fields of US. I strongly SUPPORT the OPT-extension for the following reasons:
1. Hiring international students does not mean stealing jobs from Americans.
2. After calculation, it turns out that out of all potential international employees, only 19% of them could stay and get a working VISA from the lottery. Most of them will eventually go to their home country and work there, leaving a lot of vacancies for newly graduated students.
