TANG TAO I SUPPORT this rule because the following reasons.

1. This country is based on huge immigrants from all over the world who contribute themselves to make it better. And United Stated needs high-level STEM students in the same time.

2. For the people who are against the regulation, if you cannot find a job, you should work harder or get a higher degree rather than grumbling around and owing it to international student who go to a better university than you, learn more than you and get a better job than you. 

3. STEM students can help a lot in high-tech advancement of the nation.
