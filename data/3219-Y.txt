I strongly support such an extension for it brings top talents all around the world to contribute more for the United States. The very existence of such an act is a response to the shortage of QUALIFIED engineers and scientist here, the innovation center of the world. Any objections based on the assumption that foreigners may have an advantage over natives are radiculous. It takes the company extra spenditure and time to recruit international students. Yet many companies, if not forbided by law, CHOOSE AT THEIR WILL to recruit international students. It is simply against free market and capitalism to enforce restrictions based on people's origin. The result of high rate of unemployment does not mean they lost their job. It is simply a reflection that they are NOT QUALIFIED for the job. Will you hire an unqualified lawyer to handle your class? Will you live in a house built by an unqualified engineer? Innocent people's well being is under threat if competency is shadowed by the desire to increase the cold figure of employment rate.
