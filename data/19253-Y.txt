It is really a great move from the DHS to extend OPT for 24 months, as the part of President Obama's executive action announced last year. I strongly support the steps taken by Obama's administration in improving the opportunities for nonimmigrant student communities. It's a win win situation for both students and United States economy.

On behalf of F-1 student community I sincerely request DHS ,President's Immigration action, congress members and exclusively President Obama to propose a rule to provide an easy pathway for Greencard/ US.Citizenship for the F1 students. which will help the United States to tap the potential of the student community and can contribute to tremendous economic growth of nation. 

I strongly agree and believe that United States is land of opportunities which was built by immigrants came across the globe to build this great nation and which turned into world's superpower in 300 years. When it comes to non-immigrant students, we have lot of opportunities out there, but it is always the visa status like Greencard and U.S Citizenship that organizations are looking for. It's always a struggle for the students to find an employer to sponsor a GC processing. 

I kindly request DHS and President Obama's administration to look into this and draft a rule for path to Greencard especially for F1 non immigrant visa holders.

Thank you!
