I strongly support the proposal. Most of the americans were immigrants generations ago. America becomes america because it allows opportunity for people around the world, not because it has been restricted to people stay within the borders. That is the American spirit. Allowing job opportunities only means more chance for foreign students. It is still the education, experience, and talent that earn anyone a job. Plus, job market is never saturated to the point that anyone is stealing a job or not. I work for Amazon, and a bunch of coworkers are hired directly from foreign countries because big companies like Amazon are desperately need more people, foreign or native alike. Opposing this proposal because someone thinks it will hurt native's job opportunity? How narrow minded that it!
