I strongly support the proposal. People educated in US with advance degree (for example, STEM) are crucial to US economics, inovation and high-tech. They provide enough workforce demanded by US high-tech companies, because there are no enough US citizen workforce for high-tech companies. The students who are on OPT pay taxes to US, create more job opportunites for US citizens; for example, high level managements and services. Students on OPT do compete with US citizen, however, the number of jobs created by them are more than consumed. The equal ob competion is a healthy competion, which is good for US to lead in high-tech.
