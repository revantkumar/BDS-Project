The important points are that according to the Center for Immigration Studies:

OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and

OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.

By extending the time to 3 years, you are increasing the number of American STEM workers who will not be able to find jobs.

There is a lack of security coming from no tracking of these employees. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'

These OPT program was designed to help workers in their home countries, not take away jobs from our American STEM workers. What prevents them from permanently staying in this country and permanently taking jobs away from American citizens.

This appears to be a duplicate of the H1-B program since OPT keeps the worker in this country for 3 years as does the H1-B

Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the OPT program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.
