Abhibandu Kafle I support the expanding of Optional Practical Training(OPT) rule proposal by the DHS. Foreign workforce isn't here to steal american jobs. There are already enough organizations that disallow applications from foreign students including all governmental agencies(NSA, NASA) and big companies that hold sensitive information (e.g. Boeing). 

STEM is the only field with limited number of companies that allow foreign students to work. Big-tech companies wouldn't be in today's state, had there been no contributions from foreign students. Foreign students also invest a huge sum to study in the states, and is helping American economy.
