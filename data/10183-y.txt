Yao Cheng I support to extend the OPT for the reasons as below:
(1) Many talented students especially STEM graduate students are financial supported by US government for their study in USA. It will be a great amount of payback in the future USA technology development if these students could stay in USA and work for USA after graduation. Otherwise, the investment from USA government will take nothing back.
(2) As I know, many high-level leaders in companies wanna hire international students. I had very great talks with some company leaders about this. Cause they found international graduates have many good attributes like more responsible, hard working, creative. More importantly, they can help companies have business across the world. For example,I have both two great companies show great interests in working with me and they wanna me could work for both US site and China site based my technical expertise and my back ground. The leader of one of the company even exclusively came to my phd pre-defense to support me, which is very rare even for American graduate students. Thus, for good companies, they are more care about hiring excellent students with equal opportunities and make profits all over the world.
