I strongly support this proposal because it's not only beneficial for our students but also for U.S sciences and economy. 
International students come to America to learn more knowledge and experience. It's good for them to make a contribution to American society after graduation. This makes the whole society more diverse and more benefits.
Someone says this proposal is not fair because many Americans will lost jobs. However, I would say this totally wrong. The international students got job offers because of their capabilities not their immigration. We prove that we have the same or even better abilities to handle the same job. Also the employer is the real decision maker not us. People cannot say the international students is the root cause of the job loosing. This is a good competition. If you lose, you need find reason from your own instead of the winner.
I also think the companies can get more benefits from international employees. They have more international views than the native. They can help the management team know more about international markets. The working environment will be more diverse which is good for employee improvement.
I think this is win-win proposal so I support it.
