As a international graduate student studying computer science in US. I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.
The US government should let those student learned knowledge in US keep contributing their ability to the US. Also, the three year OPT is very necessary for the US education to maintain their competition level over other countries. The proposal would significantly help the universities in US attract more students all over the world and make contribution to the growth of the universities in US. 

AS an international student, ONE of the things that attracted me came to US to study is the 17 months of STEM. I WAS strongly believed that the STEM would deeply helped me improved my ability over my career. NOW, by hearing of the court suspending STEM, I am huge DESPOINTED because the promises of 17 month of OPT was being lied to us. 

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE pass this proposal. Me, as a member of thousands international students, we say, we really need this proposal to help us build our future.
