Stem is very important to the world, to the USA. Stem students provide so much to improve this society, as international students, we pay more effort to find jobs, even though we are more qualify than some citizens. Once we got employed, we still need to worry about our identity status, the opt or H1B. Most of the time, people cannot get their h1b when they apply it at the first time, so we will need opt extension. It is so much important for our international student, also for those companies which hire us. They don't want to lose us only because we cannot get the H1B. Please help us. It maybe a small things for you, but it means a lot to us.
