I think OPT extension for 24 months is a very Good thing for most STEM students, since majority of them after graduation from school are working in technology, finance, banking, engineering, telecom, medicare and etc institutions for United States of America. That is one of the reason that US could take a leadership in the world among econometric and technology competition with other countries. 

We can not image how much loss our corporate will have if such excellent students all go back to their countries. These students are working for Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Citi group etc. If they can not stay that longer or must leave US due to this OPT policy change or canceled, thousands of projects will be delayed, billions losses will accrued. American's economy will step downward in a huge possibility. 

So, please keep these students at US and approve this OPT extension rules.
