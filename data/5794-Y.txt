Improving and expanding training opportunities for f-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees is extremely important for the U.S. and U.S. citizens and will not cause any impact on them.
First, U.S. government has spent much money on education especially universities and colleges. If international students cannot stay in the U.S. and make contribution to industries or any other aereas, the money will be wasted. Federal investment should have pay back.
Second, the power of U.S. based on the development of technology. International students with STEM degrees account for a large part of students who devoted their passion and intelligence in technology labs and companies.
Third, if more and more students with STEM degrees cannot stay and find a job, less international students will choose U.S. universities and colleges as their choice if they want to study abroad. Then U.S. universities and colleges will spend more federal money to thrive because of lacking internation students. U.S. will also lose a lot of smartest students in the world.
Fourth, F-1 students with STEM degrees will not cause U.S. citizens to lose their jobs. Students will spend money in U.S. and more people will be hired to serve more customers in other areas.
