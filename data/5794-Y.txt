Gerald Presley The Optional Practical Training Program (OPT):

It's revealed that the OPT program / law or regulation denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.
We know the original purpose of OPT was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is NOW mostly used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.
There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. This gives employers a BIG incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers UNDERMINES and HARMS the job opportunities for American STEM workers.
We know employers want OPTs because they are younger /cheaper than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. In other words, cheap hires giving employers more money off of cheaper workers and and then costing taxpayers! OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year. This simply is wrong, abusive and grossly UNFAIR!
