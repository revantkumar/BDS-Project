Daniel Cheng I am a new American citizen and I support this proposal. I know how hard it is to stay in the US as an international, I and many of my friends go through this long process. How I see the difficult situation for students in OPT and know how hard it is to face an unstable future, I hope that we can give them a chance. I dont think they can steal my sons job, we have too many advantages over them.
