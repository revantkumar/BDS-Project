Dear Beverly,

There are plenty of restrictions on international students to protect American students and workers. They can only extend OPT if their employer is in the e verify program. Plus, most employers don't hire them, to avoid the pricey and cumbersome sponsorship processes. Only a small percentage of international students can get employed in the US. These are the top ones that we want to retain. They are the top performers in their field with strong work ethic. In the long run, OPT will only benefit America.

Regards,
