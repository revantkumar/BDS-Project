I strongly support the rule. Following is my reasoning.
1. This rule attracts Foreign talent in Math, Science, Energy and that make the US as a leader in all these area.
2. This rule substantially improves students ability to achieve the objectives of their courses of study by gaining valuable knowledge and skills through on-the-job training, which will help the country for that time being and their home country.
3. This rule will benefit U.S. educational system to be globally competitive as well as U.S employers to explore global trends provided that all these students bring their cultural values and also spread US culture in the whole world.
4. This rule will increase the chance of retention of students that will provide the country competitive edge in STEM areas.
5. This rule will bring a significant amount of money (tuition & accommodation) into U.S economy, provided that rule increases the interest of foreign talent to choose the US instead of other countries for education.
