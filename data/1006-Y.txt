As an engineer working in the U.S., I have seen smart people form all over the world making tremendous contribution to this country, especially in those technology companies. The laptop you are using, as well as cars, phones, and all those software running on your electronics, won't be like this without those foreign engineers. Stopping this rule will be a disaster for silicon valley and it will only make more U.S. citizens lose their job instead of getting more opportunities.
