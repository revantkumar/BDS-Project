Befor we bring in more people into this country for jobs that do not
exist ! 
Lets think America first First...
When we here about hundreds of our Citizens getting replaced by H1B 
Visas, brought in to replace the curent American Workers. With our
Government knowingly and still letting it happen !
This to the American People means NO. There is No Way That This
Or Aney Other Way ...
Do We Need More Workers In Our Country...
With this said, We still have way to maney people looking for work
that are not even counted. Almost one quarter of the Country...
