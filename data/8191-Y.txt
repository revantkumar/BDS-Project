I do support STEM extension for the following reasons:
1. People disagree new policy claim F-1 non-immigrants harm the U.S. economy. That's ridiculous. Let me ask a question what makes the U.S. strongest country in the world? Talents from all over the world. Look back the history of 1776, how could U.S. founded when there was no U.S. citizen? During the long journey of development of U.S. endless talents all over the world come to U.S. If U.S. government pushed them away because their identity, choose to ignored their talent, then there is no prosperity today of U.S.
2. F-1 non-immigrant student make high tech companies hire more talents. Always remember, U.S. citizens has two big advantage, visa and language. International students has to strive to earn the job opportunity. With the same level of skill, why would company hire the one who has visa and language issue. Those international students who got the job, they all had a hard time studying and seeking job. They earn it, it's not fair to give them only 1-year work opportunity.
3. High tech company love to hire international students, because they are willing to do the job which american won't do. International students cherish the opportunity to work in U.S. whatever it takes. There are lot of trivial but necessary work, international students will cover for you. Without those help, high tech company will be worried who make lots of contribution to U.S.
