I strongly support OPT extension which is necessary for the development of America. The foreign students are not snatching jobs from Americans, they are actually making contributions to America. Without OPT, the number of foreign students will drop down and American's international education reputation is at stack. Furthermore, the people who oppose the OPT extension is not Americans in essence, because American is build from immigrations. Who oppose foreign students is actually destroying American!
