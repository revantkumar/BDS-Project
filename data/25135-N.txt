I am writing to oppose the proposed rule by Homeland Security Department. OPT removed $4billion from social security and medicare. As a retired person who paid into SS and Medicare my entire working life, I resent money being used for any other purpose than for what it is intended. Also, my husband and I owned our own small business so we paid both halves of SS and Medicare. I say, Americans first. And the cost to employers is too high. Quit taxing businesses to death. It's the governments fault that employers look for ways to cut their taxes.

Taking money out os social security is stealing. It must stop.
