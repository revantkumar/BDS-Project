Chip Truman Simply unbelievable to me that foreign born workers would be given preferential treatment over American workers. Who thinks this up anyway and how is this meant to help American workers. At 50 years old, I was fired from Cummins Engine Co. and replaced with foreign born engineers. I am an excellent engineer, hold two patents, a copyright, and provided documented cost savings to Cummins in excess of $30,000,000.00. I have recently heard from a Cummins engineering manager, that over 75% of the engineers at Cummins are foreign born. My family has been in this country since the 1600's, I have six 4th of 5th great-grandfathers that fought in the Revolutionary War. Harry Truman is a cousin and to think we are treated this way is an abomination.

Sincerely,
Chip Truman
