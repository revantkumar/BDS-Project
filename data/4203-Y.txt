Having seen too many comment posts full of cliche about this act hurting American stem students and spoiling their foreign counterparts, no matter how vivid the story-telling or how compassionate the argument might be, I just want to point out that what you are looking at are no more than emotional outbreaks of mediocre native players who have long grown used to and taken for granted the privilege of being born an American. If you feel so hurt by a mere act to expand just a grace-period like granting of opportunities to your foreign fellows, you are probably too sensitive to contribute to the advancement of engineering and technology for this country. The true backbone of American engineering doesn't depend so much on those anyway, but rather is built mostly on the top-notch talents in any area, who should never have the worry of foreign competitors as a job seeker. 

Similar policies like establishment of H1 visa and general 12 month OPT have been around for many years and have proven to work well for maintaining a healthy and diversified technology industry. The balance has been established and the prior 17-month extension has served as a de facto buffer for both tech companies and foreign stem students to work around a h1b lottery fail. An revocation of this rule will presumably result in a chaos in the job market of relevant areas. Greatly impacted will not only be foreign stem students seeking for jobs but also many tech companies as they would find it harder to take in competent new workforce from an almost exclusively domestic talent pool.

This rule should be adopted and passed through to support healthy engineering and IT industries and thus a continued recovery of US economy.
