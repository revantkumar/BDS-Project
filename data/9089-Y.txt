Justan Averageperson CPT and OPT are very great ways to improve our skills and learn some applied technology in our respective fields. STEM extension is a similar opportunity to work in such good environments and learn a lot which can't all be covered in college irrespective of the degree or field. I think it should continue and for the better, extend so that students can get more exposure of industry level experience.
