I believe it's necessary to give F1STEM students enough time to stay instead of cutting their time in USA. These students are talented and have great benefits for big companies in America, if the policy cut their stay time then big company's will loose too much talents and resources. The whole industry in America will face absolute decrease and students will also panic and have a series of procedures for this policy.
