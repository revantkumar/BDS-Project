I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. international students with higher education are important to U.S. economy development. For example, international students pay higher education tuition to come to U.S. and wanna to gain the work experience before going back, which is good to university of college. While international student studying or working with OPT extension, they need to pay for rental, grocery, utility and so on to local people or government. 
2. if this proposal cannot go through, how could U.S. attract such great amount of inter national students, especially with master or Ph.D degree level. They may consider to go other countries.
