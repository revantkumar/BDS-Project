I agree with government expand training opportunity for international students. First, as we all know more smart and creative students can help with technique improving which would finally caused more and more created jobs. Second, I think that the employers have rights to employ the worker that is more valuable, expanding valid time would help US society keep those intelligent employees which would estabulish a better world.
