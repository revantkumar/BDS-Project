This extension should be approved and implemented before it is too late. This policy attracts smart and well-trained students all over the world to the US instead of our global competitors. These students contribute hugely to make the US a better country which benefits everyone here, both citizens and non-citizens. The risk of losing these people (or even worse, driving them to competitors) is not affordable in the long run. 

I understand the concern that this policy might be reducing the share of local workers in the job market. But on the other hand, having these smart people working around us can make the ENTIRE cake bigger, not only for us, but more importantly, for our kids and theirs. Can you imagine your kids have to find a job in Asia or Europe as a NON-CITIZEN ten years later, just because we refuse to work with these smart people today?
