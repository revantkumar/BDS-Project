I extremely and sincerely SUPPORT and AGREE WITH the proposal for the following reasons:

1.Diversity of people and talent is a very vital factor for the success of USA. Without those brilliant F-1 students, who make much contribution to various aspects of American society, I can not imagine what the situation will be in the future.

2.Many companies in USA need those STEM students to work for them because it is a win-win situation.

3.Many STEM students get a lot of Scholarship from US schools. If they come back to their own country immediately after graduation , it will be a huge waste of money from the position of US schools and government. 

4.If some STEM students can not get the chance to extend their OPT, they will continue to apply for graduate school such as Phd , which will increase the pressure for native students.

Thus, based on above discussion, I strongly SUPPORT this proposal.
