Sitting Bull I am strongly "against" giving immigrants more chances. I have two typical examples of how two immigrants changed the America hugely, really hugely!

One is a British immigrant, Josiah Franklin, who is an hardworking young blacksmith with 10 children who toke jobs social welfare from the natives; besides he is the father of "the first American" Benjamin Franklin. 

Another one is Thomas Paine, who is a sorehead young journalist who cannot find a job in France, so he moved to the America to take our jobs away.

Finally, my name is Sitting Bull, thanks!
