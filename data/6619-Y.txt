Yi Cui I am an international student currently working as a control/software engineer for Caterpillar on the OPT program. The program helps me to develop and polish skill in control software development. The opportunity adds great value to my personal career development and while in the meantime also benefits United States in a longer term. 
To support my point that OPT benefits US in a long term, I would like to cite story of Robin Li, one of the most successful entrepreneurs in China. Robin is a co-founder of Baidu, a chinese search engine company. Baidu. In 1994, Robin finished his master degree from University of Buffalo and he got his first job from IDD Information Services, a New Jersey division of Dow Jones and Company, where he helped improve algorithms for search engines. This was a good start for Robin's career and he gained training and opportunity to work on projects that he was good at and liked. This is not end of the story. Just 11 years later, Robin's own company, Baidu, issued public offering on NASDAQ just 11 year later on 2005. On 2010, Baidu had its research center located in California. Today just Baidu's research center provides about 200 tech positions for California and the company shares tens of millions of its earning with US investors, with its net income being more than 2 billion dollars in 2014 fiscal year. Robin's success serves as a great example of a mutually beneficial interaction between an international student and United States. Without his years in Wall Streets, Robin might ended up being a well qualified software developer in China but not a tremendously successful entrepreneur that brings useful technology to China and work positions and values to United States.
