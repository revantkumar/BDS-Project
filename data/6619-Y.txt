I agree with F-1 non-immigrant student visa regulations on optional practical training (OPT) for certain students with degrees in STEM degrees.

Firstly, international students make a lot contributions to the science and technology development. They are young but creative to apply what they have learned to real American industry. While without OPT duration, American industry will lose an important power in the development of technology. 

Secondly, the existence of international students with OPT has no disadvantages for American society. They occupies only a small part of the employees and keep the cultural diversity in industry.
