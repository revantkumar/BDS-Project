I totally agree with this 24 months OPT policy. The foreign students in engineering and science definitely need a longer period of the OPT. Comparing with non-STEM person (business, public, etc), engineering and science projects always need a very long period to design, implement, release, and service. Based on my experience, 12 months period is not enough for a typical project cycle in engineering field, and definitely not enough for a typical science project (actually even 24 months is not enough). Thus, if we still use the old 17 months, or use 12 months as for non-STEM OPT student, there are will be many many important projects and research cannot be finished before they leave US. Hence, for STEM students OPT period, 24 months is just enough, so I totally agree with and support this OPT policy. And finally, I also emphasize that if you can extend the OPT period for science-area student to 36 months would be much profit their studies, their contributions, and the power of USA, not for now but for future.
