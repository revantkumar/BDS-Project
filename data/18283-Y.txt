As an international student working under CPT and planning to switch to OPT in this summer, I support 24 month extension. This will give us opportunity to work in US and also give more time for the companies to consider H1b application. If OPT extension is canceled, companies will not hire international graduates just for 1 year or they need to apply H1b within the same year which is not guaranteed as well.
