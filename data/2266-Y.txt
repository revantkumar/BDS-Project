I DO SUPPORT the extension.

As a graduate student in STEM, the working experience in US is very IMPORTANT for me. And I believe other international students are same with me. We work here for the practice and experience. At the same time, having foreign students in workplace actually contribute to the US society like improving the diversity.

In addition, I want to say international students have nothing to do with the minimum rage!! The students spent a huge amount of tuition fees, and the living spending is expensive too. The minimum rage cannot cover those cost!!
