As the founder of an organization that mentors recently immigrated high school students, I've seen first hand the drive, generosity and grit that so many young immigrants bring out our country from around the world. 

These individuals should be given every opportunity to pursue their dreams. We as Americans should do our part to exhibit the founding principles of our nation including full inclusion for those seeking opportunity here.
