I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..

America herself is a nation of immigrant. Diversity of immigrants make America #1 country in the world. Competition do exist, but the immigrants do not compete with those who desperately need a job by lowering salary requirements. The companies sometimes have to hire non-U.S. immigrants because the number of American who fits those job requirements is too small, i.e. programmer.

If the U.S. is rejecting immigrants, she is rejecting sustainable development.
