This is a very good propose. As a STEM student, I found most job requirement is citizen and permanent resident only, which makes us finding a job more difficult. And this can help this situation a little bit.

I also think you should cancel or modify the time restriction for applying OPT. For example, I got my electrical engineering master degree in 2013 and I went straight to PHD program without applying my OPT. However, this year, my PHD advisor abandoned me by going to another school. I have to start over or quit. Given this awkward situation, the OPT rule restrict me applying for it using my master degree that I got in 2013. I have to graduate another master degree or graduate a PHD degree in order to be qualified applying again. This really sucks because I have to apply to another master program or start over my PHD project(which requires at least 3 more years). I really hope I can apply a OPT now and using my EE master degree to find a job.

You just waste a very good STEM employee this way and given me and my families a huge burden.
