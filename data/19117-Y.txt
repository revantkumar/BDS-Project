There are a lot STEM graduates in my company. Most of them are intelligent, hard-working and playing an important role in the company. The company benefits a lot from these STEM employees because it's simply too hard to get enough number of qualified employees in the states. I don't understand why people are saying this policy will affect US job market. The company, especially high-tech companies need these people.
