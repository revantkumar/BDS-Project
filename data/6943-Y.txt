I am very happy with the decision of DHS to increase the OPT STEM Extension to 24 months. The United States is the land of immigrants and over the past 200 years it had welcomed many immigrants. This country couldnt be where it is if it said no to immigrants. People might say we are inviting a large number of H1 visa holders and there is no need to increase the OPT time frame. But the H1 visa holders work here and send the money back to their home country which is not helping the US economy. On the other hand the students who studied here pay the tuition (Out-of-State) to the Universities. If for some reason the OPT time frame gets reduced, these students may not be as interested as they are before to study in US. As a result the American Universities will be losing a lot of money and as a result they might not give funding to other students like before.

I think it is not fair to send back the students who have spent thousands of dollars and help the countrys economy. Most of the STEM students are Masters Students so, they have sufficient knowledge or even more to be considered as skilled workers like the H1B workers. Also, because they studied here they will be having a good idea and are adapted to the conditions here. The United States is the dream land of every student who wants to peruse their field of interest and this country must be happy to invite them and provide opportunities to them. 

The final point is, if the OPT time frame gets reduced the STEM students might not be as interested as before to come to US and it will be having a huge effect (financially) to the Universities and the countrys economy.
