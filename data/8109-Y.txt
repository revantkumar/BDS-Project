I do think this is very beneficial for American citizens as well. 
1. From my experience interviewing with different companies, one of their major concern is losing talents after 1 - 2 years of training. For the U.S. companies, being able to employ the best talent across the world is definitely beneficial. Plus, the world is integrating. It is very crucial to listen to the opinion and to innovate.
2. The U.S. education program is attractive in that it has this OPT program that allows students to practice what they learned in school. Ensuring this part of the education can help attract more international students, which brings in revenue for the nation.

Thanks,
