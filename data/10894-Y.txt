I support this rule, strongly and firmly. Why there are so many people against it? Do you know how many "foreigners" are contributing themselves for USA? For those who said "foreigners" are taking natives job opportunities. I must say, 1) we are minority group and you are majority group; 2) about 80% of companies in USA not willing to hire a "foreigner"; 3) Engineer robots are going to take 40% of job position in the future in USA. Why you don't against them?

The students graduate from STEM are the most precious possession for the US, who have a big potential to support the development of your country. "Foreigners" contribute their life, energy, and youth without family here, not only want to achieve their goals, or American dreams, but also want to help this great country to grow big. Yes, American dream is the only reason for most of people who fight for their lives here. Also includes American's ancestor. Don't forget, USA is an immigrant country. And most importantly, those immigrants made a great country. So you can live in this beautiful, and powerful place.
