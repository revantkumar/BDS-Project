I totally support this STEM extension policy. 

1. US is an immigration country. The ancestors of all US citizens are from different nations. Hundreds of millions of excellent foreigners have made great contributions to US since 1776. 

2. US society should be compatible and open to F-1 nonimmigrant students. Not all of them want to stay in the US, many of them plan to return their own countries after study and internship. Even though some students want to find a job in US, if they are not excellent enough, they still cannot stay here. 

3. US culture encourages competition rather than exclusion. Competition from foreigners can effectively inspire current US citizens and keep our society prosperous. Without competition, one country would become lazy and gradually lose entrepreneurial spirit.
