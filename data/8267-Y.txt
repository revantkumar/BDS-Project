From my prospect of view, i am felling that this proposed rule is good for both the united states and stem students. 
Here is my points:
I finished my bachelor degree in China and got my master degree in Carnegie Mellon University. The CMU is one of top university in the US, and it also has a large amount of international students from India, China, South Korea and so on. There is no doubts that these international students are among the top students in their own country, if they can stay and work in the US by the benefit of opt and extension, the US would be the biggest beneficial owner, try to think which country do not want many intelligent people work for them? 
Nowadays too many American students wants to be CEO, lawer or work in the Wall Street, not many of them want to be an engineer, if you take a look at many big IT companies in Silicon Valley, foreigner are making the real contributions. Canceling opt extension is like teaching these intelligent people many skills, after one year tell them we dont need you any more, go back to build your own country and compete with the US. If in that case, the US would be the biggest loser. 
In my conclusion, high technology people is good for US, they are diligent and polite!
