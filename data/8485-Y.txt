In general DHS have taken right step to overcome the bottleneck of current h1B visa issue. But I don't know how many readers really go through this proposal. This OPT extension proposal have lots of complexity for both students and employers as per massive documents record keeping is concerned. Secondly I think DHS totally ignore for non-stem
master or phd degree holder case like MBA who are much more experience with high academic background with core science, computer science from non us university and other non stem degree also. These group of guys actually contribute to improve US economy and in future start their business venture in USA, where US can get real benefit from them. 
Although DHS have placed a proposal for non stem master degree holder for OPT extension like MBA, but in reality very few students have done BS in stem degree then complete MBA. Most of the international student come with non US stem degree holder with computer science or IT with excellent academic background with minimum 4-5 years experience. my query to DHS if non us degree accept for H1B visa as per US rule then why not in OPT extension.
My last query is as per current OPT extension proposal, how many MBA student will be interested to work as per their previous stem degree, because they are doing MBA for implement their previous valuable experience to managerial technology field and develop a new business model to improve companies revenue.
