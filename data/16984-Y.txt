I strongly support the OPT extension. I think it's not the just the textbook and school projects that students do at Universities attract students to come to U.S. to study, it's also the potential working experience that foreign students can gain at U.S., the unique working environment and mentorship which can't be offered at anywhere else. Both the University education and working experience complete the education value, otherwise, it would be unwise to come to U.S. to study at the cost of spend so much money which can give foreign students better life at their homecountrsies. Moreover, it's at work that foreign students and local Americans can exchange them experiences and knowledge and build an multicultural environment that benefits both parties. I'm also unsure that if foreign students really rob the jobs that potentially offered to U.S. citizens, even with OPT, not every foreign students major in STEM could get a job, they must compete with foreign and local students with their knowledge and skills, and I'm sure the companies would choose wisely, in addition, foreign students and locals are specialize in different areas or contributes in different ways with their different backgrounds and skill sets. Furthermore, I'm sure many foreign students would want to return to their home countries after several years of study, it would potentially lead to granting local citizens better social networks. I also doubt that giving jobs to foreigners would discourage local students to study STEM, it would probably more of matter of motivation and education methods. Last but not least, contributions of foreign workers at U.S. is not negligible, it really helps U.S. to stay competitive and informed in it's STEM industries.
