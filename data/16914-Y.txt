I strongly SUPPORT the OPT extension rule, since it can attract more international students.

International students have made significant contributions to U.S, both through the payment of tuition and other expenditures in U.S economy, as well as by significantly enhancing academic discourse and cultural exchange on campuses throughout U.S. In addition to these general benefits, STEM students further contribute through research, innovation, and the provision of knowledge and skills that help maintain and grow increasingly important sectors of the U.S economy.

Only with more and more foreign talents can U.S develops faster and faster.
