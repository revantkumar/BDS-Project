International students should be given opportunities to work for this country, because: 1. good for these students to get experience before being qualified for a work VISA; 2. more importantly, US has provided huge fundings to these STEM field for education and research (a lot of graduate students never pay anything to finish their degrees in US), and we don't want them to be educated for free in the US and bring all knowledge and expertise to other countries. That'd a huge loss to companies, academies, this country and people. Yes, they are competing with US citizens for job positions. However, this is a good motivation for US citizens to improve themselves and to be competitive in the market. Eventually this will increase the overall level of the entire country in the fields of STEM and many other areas.

Almost everyone in this country is immigrants or children of immigrants not too long ago. Labor market should be open to everyone and let the employers to choose the best candidates. This would be the ultimate solution for the real development and advancement of the United States.
