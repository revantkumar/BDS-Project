I highly support this proposal that aims to extend the OPT period by 24 months. First, the extension does create more job opportunities for international students, while at the same time it will not harm the US citizens by decreasing their chances of getting a job. The reason is that there are still a large number of companies will hire citizens only and not sponsor H1B, which is already unfair for international students with the same education level. As far as I can see, none of the current citizens in our graduate program (hence have the same education background as the international students) are not able to get a job because the so called 'competition'. 

Second, as I have heard a lot of projects in industrial companies last usually much longer than 12 months (e.g. clinical trails in medical device companies). Without extension, new-graduates will loss their jobs after 12 months and at the same time it costs a lot (manpower and material resources) for the company who suffers from projects transaction from one group of people to another. They need to train the new employees from the beginning and wait long enough for them to get familiar with current projects. 

Third, as a current student, I spend my days at school with professors with different cultures and backgrounds. 20 or 30 years ago, these respectable researchers were newly graduated students and looking for jobs in the US as a non-citizen. Look at how much contribution they have made so far, we, the current international students, would like to make the same contribution by going to either academia or industry. 

In the conclusion, this extension will certainly benefit both the students and the US, including every citizen. Sincerely hope students with F-1 Visa will have a better chances of staying in the US, making contributions to this country who has given a lot to equipment them with the most powerful knowledge!
