I will raise both hands up to support this rule by following reasons:

First, among the large IT or pharmaceutical companies e.g. Microsoft, Amazon, Amgen,etc., international graduates students who has strong technical abilities occupied more than 30% in the company. One-year initial OPT time is too short for themselves to further contribute to a scientific or technical project as well as too short for a company to train people and finish an important project. But plus another two-year in this rule will be a great choice benefiting both individual and company.

Second, large corporations will lose a large amount of talented people if this rule won't be implemented soon. I cannot believe how bad situations this will happen in the real, e.g., large companies need to rearrange the company' groups or cut down some projects, or even more badly there will be another economic crisis which will arise soon.

Last but not least, United State is a multicultural developed country, the more suitable and beneficial regulations for international people, the more United State will benefit from them. And this 24 months OPT extension, I believe, is one of the necessary regulation.

In conclusion, I give strong backing to this 24 month OPT extension rule. From small point, this rule will benefit both individual who study in the States and companies who need relevant talented personnel. From large point, it will also continuously improve the economics of the United States.
