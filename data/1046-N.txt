It is wrong to put foreign graduates ahead of graduating Americans. We have a job opportunity problem in the U.S.
created by greedy corporations and aided by greedy politicans. Our government has ruined our country with their policies.
It is not Democrat Party versus Republican party as both are quility of the destruction. Where is the shame and where is the 
accountability.
My son can not get a job because of illegals. Companies now want you to speak spanish because most of their workers 
are too dumb to learn english. Companies have created sweat shops using foreign labor.
The CEO's need to take a cut from their millions in pay and hire American citizens.
My present goverment is disgusting in how they give better treatment to non citizens over the citizens.

Disgusted and Fed UP.
