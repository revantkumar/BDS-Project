Suppose U.S. is not supportive and welcoming for international students in the work market, why would they come all the way here, leaving family behind, paying expense tuition to get education here? They might as well get a good education and it will be easier to find a job in their home country. Thus, if U.S. is not supportive for letting international students to work here, there will be a sharp drop of interest for internationals to come study, and will thus greatly impact the universities, the colleges, the economy and the society.

Also, allowing internationals to contribute their talent here is undoubtedly beneficial for U.S. One of the most important factors that make U.S. the strongest country is its openness and embracement for diversity. It's diversity that propel growth and encourages innovation. U.S. will stop growing if the door is close and Americans refuse to embrace changes and diversity.
