In STEM fields, international students who hold OPT extension visa are playing a more and more critical role in American's society. Most of STEM students have master or even PhD diplomas in science and technology, which are the main motivation to push the industry development in US. Since the industry is short of American native highly educated workers, OPT STEM students can fill in the blank in software, semi-conductor, clean energy, new generation biological engineering and etc. In addition, OPT extension visa can protect the most valuable employees with work eligibility during the H1B visa application, which can extend their employment or even help them become highly educated US citizens without invest any pennies for their tuition since primary school. Besides, by considering their good salary, they are also strong tax-payers, although they are not considered as US middle-class due to their citizenship.

In summary, please try to understand that students in STEM will definitely find their jobs in any countries on this planet due to huge demand. Instead of driving them back to their mother country, US government should do the best to keep these students and employees to prevent them from becoming INDUSTRY COMPETITORS against American companies. We all know that some of the developing counties like China and India are eager to have educated employees to keep in pace with US. I believe America would lose more by decline these OPT extension visa with a short-term provincial sight. US high technology companies would lose even more by helping their competitors hire those students.
