This is a great thing! I strongly support this rule. By this many students can gain knowledge and some experience for their future development mainly in science and technology. From this many students can do well in the business when they come back to their mother land. Through this rule many Non-immigration students work in their OPT period, gains experience for them and many companies can be benefited.

It would be great if this rule gets approved.
